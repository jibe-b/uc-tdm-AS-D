== Model alignement

The models of the GnpIS/WheatIS databases align to the model of the text mining data. The model of the Solr index used by GnpIS/WheatIS differ from the one used by Alvis. Hence the transfer of data from the Alvis platform to GnpIS/WheatIS requires to destructure some data to a plain text field in order to make it searchable.

== Data production

Until now the execution of the text mining workflow is done on the Migale platform at INRA.

The workflow is detailled in the <<production_processing.adoc#, production processing documentation>>

== Data Updates

The resulting text mining data is made available to the parent application maintainers as a downloadable file.

They can be downloaded at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/~jbbohuon/uc-d-linking-wheat-data-with-literature/wheat-corpus-annotation_latest.csv
