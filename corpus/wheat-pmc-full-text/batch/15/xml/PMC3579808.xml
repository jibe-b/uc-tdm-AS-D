      <abstract>
        <p>A total of 358 recent European winter wheat varieties plus 14 spring wheat varieties were evaluated for resistance to <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight (FHB) caused by <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic> in four separate environments. The FHB scores based on FHB incidence (Type I resistance)&#xD7;FHB severity (Type II resistance) indicated a wide phenotypic variation of the varieties with BLUE (best linear unbiased estimation) values ranging from 0.07 to 33.67. Genotyping with 732 microsatellite markers resulted in 782 loci of which 620 were placed on the ITMI map. The resulting average marker distance of 6.8 cM allowed genome wide association mapping employing a mixed model. Though no clear population structure was discovered, a kinship matrix was used for stratification. A total of 794 significant (&#x2212;log<sub>10</sub>(p)-value&#x2265;3.0) associations between SSR-loci and environment-specific FHB scores or BLUE values were detected, which included 323 SSR alleles. For FHB incidence and FHB severity a total of 861 and 877 individual marker-trait associations (MTA) were detected, respectively. Associations for both traits co-located with FHB score in most cases. Consistent associations detected in three or more environments were found on all chromosomes except chromosome 6B, and with the highest number of MTA on chromosome 5B. The dependence of the number of favourable and unfavourable alleles within a variety to the respective FHB scores indicated an additive effect of favourable and unfavourable alleles, i.e. genotypes with more favourable or less unfavourable alleles tended to show greater resistance to FHB. Assessment of a marker specific for the dwarfing gene <italic>Rht-D1</italic> resulted in strong effects. The results provide a prerequisite for designing genome wide breeding strategies for FHB resistance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight, caused by the fungal pathogens <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic> is one of the most important fungal diseases of wheat and other cereals in the world. In addition to causing severe yield losses, <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is known to produce two important mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone, which can contaminate the diseased grains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/PDF/Fusarium_Head_Blight_.pdf">http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/PDF/Fusarium_Head_Blight_.pdf</ext-link>). The development and use of resistant cultivars is considered an important strategy for avoiding <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection. Resistance to <italic>Fusarium</italic> is quantitatively inherited. Therefore during the last decade a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies using molecular markers were conducted. The first mapped QTL originated from the Chinese spring wheat accession &#x2018;Sumai 3&#x2019; or its derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Anderson1">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Jayatilake1">[3]</xref>] and later efforts were undertaken to integrate these QTL into adapted germplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Miedaner1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Salameh1">[6]</xref>. This was followed by the identification and mapping of QTL for <italic>Fusarium</italic> resistance and mycotoxin accumulation in a number of bi-parental winter wheat populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Paillard1">[7]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Miedaner2">[13]</xref>, as well as efforts to introduce the novel QTL into elite background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Wilde1">[14]</xref>. Meta-analysis of QTL locations summarized the mapping efforts and identified linked markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Buerstmayr2">[15]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Lffler1">[17]</xref>. During the studies, the relationship between plant height and <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight resistance became evident <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Mao1">[18]</xref>, and the effects of dwarfing genes <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> on susceptibility to <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight were studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Miedaner3">[19]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Srinivasachary2">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), originally developed in human genetics, are nowadays employed in numerous studies involving model and crop plants and are showing there much greater success with fewer resources than in human genetics (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Hamblin1">[22]</xref>). While the classical QTL-mapping is limited to bi-parental populations, GWAS identify the novel functional variation in a broad spectrum of varieties or accessions and thus are suitable for allele mining. Additionally, more meiotic events, that have taken place during evolution or cultivar development, are taken into account compared to bi-parental populations, resulting in an increased genetic resolution in dependence of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the species under investigation. In wheat, GWAS were reported for various traits including yield and agronomic traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Neumann1">[23]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Wang1">[25]</xref>, baking and milling quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Breseghello1">[26]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Bordes1">[28]</xref>, ear emergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-LeGouis1">[29]</xref>, pre-harvest sprouting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Kulwal1">[30]</xref> and resistance to pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Crossa1">[31]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Yu2">[34]</xref>. <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight resistance was studied using an association genetics approach in barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Massman1">[35]</xref> as well as in wheat germplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Miedaner4">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The goal of this study was (1) to assess the resistance to <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight in a set of 358 recent European winter wheat varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties as outgroup in four year/location combinations (&#x200A;=&#x200A;environments) in the field, (2) to determine the marker-trait associations for resistance to <italic>Fusarium</italic> based on genome wide coverage using 732 SSR markers plus markers for candidate genes, and (3) to compare the obtained results with QTL reported in the literature.</p>

        <p>FHB rating was based on four separate environments and BLUEs (best linear unbiased estimations) values were calculated across all environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057500.s003">Table S1</xref>). For the FHB score, FHB incidence (Type I resistance)&#xD7;FHB severity (Type II resistance) were taken into account. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients between BLUEs of FHB scores with BLUEs of FHB incidence and FHB severity were high with 0.991 and 0.958, respectively. Therefore the further analysis was focused on the FHB scores. FHB scores varied for the separate environments with means from 9.24 (2009.CEC) up to 11.83 (2010.BOD).

        <title>Molecular data analysis, linkage disequilibrium and population structure</title>
        <p>The 372 varieties were genotyped with 732 microsatellite markers, of which 48 amplified more than one locus, resulting in a total of 782 loci spread across the 21 chromosomes. Heterozygote genotype calls were found for 2.6% of the data. With 4.8% missing data points, 276844 datapoints (95%) were available for the association analysis. For the construction of a genetic map using the ITMI (International Triticeae Mapping Initiative) recombinant inbred mapping population, a LOD score of 3.0 was taken as the threshold to declare linkage. A total of 620 markers were placed on this map, with 19 SSR markers mapping to more than one position in the genome, resulting in a map of 4470 cM length. The remaining markers could not be mapped onto this population due to lack of data or polymorphism. Altogether, this resulted in an average marker distance of 7.2 cM (ranging from 4.6 cM on chromosome 4B to 10.2 cM on chromosome 6A). The genome was evenly covered, with the D-genome being slightly overrepresented (38.5% of the markers) and homoeologous group 6 being slightly underrepresented (9.8% of markers).</p>
        <p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is described with the parameter r<sup>2</sup>. Of the 8146 marker pairs, which returned r<sup>2</sup> values, 62.9% (5121) showed statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) LD as determined via 10,000 permutations. The average r<sup>2</sup> for loci on different chromosomes (unlinked loci) was 0.031. R<sup>2</sup> was in general low, being higher between neighbouring marker pairs (0.03 on chromosome 6A to 0.14 on chromosome 4B) than between all marker pairs on the same chromosome (0.02 on chromosomes 1B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 3D, 5D, 6A, 6D, 7A and 7D to 0.08 on chromosome 4D) and reached its lowest value for marker distances above 50 cM with 0.01 between all marker pairs on the same chromosome. For distances below 10 cM it was slightly higher (0.09 for all marker pairs on the same chromosome and 0.11 for neighbouring marker pairs) than for distances between 10 to 20 cM (0.05 for all marker pairs on the same chromosome and 0.03 between neighbouring marker pairs). The critical value for LD was 0.176. Above this value LD was considered to be due to genetic linkage. Only 207 marker pairs were in LD because of genetic linkage since their r<sup>2</sup> was higher than 0.176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057500-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>For FHB score, a total of 157 mapped markers showed MTA; often two or several different alleles of a marker were significant and most MTA were detected in several environments (Fig S1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057500.s007">Table S5</xref>). All chromosomes showed MTA, though for chromosome 6B only one individual MTA was detected. The highest number of MTA was detected for chromosome 5B with two linkage blocks of neighbouring markers on the reference map (GWM843, GWM213, GWM335, GWM1108 and GWM1475, GWM777, WMC75, GWM408). Similar linkage blocks of four markers were also seen on chromosome 3A (BARC294, BARC321, BARC57, BARC129) and chromosome 4D (BARC98, WMC437, GWM819, GDM129).</p>
        <p>Since microsatellites are multi-allelic markers, different alleles may show different kinds of effects. A negative additive effect, which means increasing resistance, was detected for 237 MTA for FHB score, while 557 MTA showed positive additive effects, meaning decreasing resistance. Both kinds of effects were often detected for the same marker, depending on the respective alleles.</p>
        <p>The marker data of two known genes, previously reported to have an influence on <italic>Fusarium</italic> resistance, were applied in this association analysis.

          <p>Chromosome 5B was the chromosome, where the highest number of individual MTA was detected, and it was characterized by two highly significant linkage blocks of four markers each (GWM843, GWM213, GWM335, GWM1108 and GWM1475, GWM777, WMC75, GWM408).

Another linkage block at the end of chromosome arm 5BL in our study, involving markers BARC59, GWM1016, GWM4209, was located in a similar region like the QTL described for the marker interval GWM1246-PSR145 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Paillard1">[7]</xref>.

        <title>Effects of plant height and flowering time</title>
        <p>We found strong effects for the dwarfing gene <italic>Rht-D1</italic>, with the mutant allele decreasing the resistance. A general correlation was detected between plant height and FHB resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057500.s006">Table S4</xref>). The same effect was described for nearly isogenic lines of <italic>Rht-B1</italic> and <italic>Rht-D1</italic> alleles in the background of &#x2018;Mercia&#x2019; and &#x2018;Maris Huntsman&#x2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Miedaner3">[19]</xref>. However, the authors pointed out, that the negative effects of short plant height on FHB susceptibility can be counteracted by a more resistant genetic background. Coincident meta-QTL between plant height and FHB resistance were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Mao1">[18]</xref>. It was argued <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Srinivasachary1">[20]</xref>, that the effect of <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> may not only be an indirect effect, caused by a changed microenvironment due to shorter plants, but that there may be a direct effect of <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> on the susceptibility to FHB, since <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> affects type I resistance (incidence) rather than the type II resistance (spread of pathogen). However, in our dataset we detected significant MTA of <italic>Rht-D1</italic> for FHB score, as well as FHB incidence and FHB severity. We did not find any effects for <italic>Rht-B1</italic> (former <italic>Rht1</italic>) on chromosome 4BS. The reason may be, that this dwarfing gene was present in only few varieties. The two most resistant varieties &#x2018;Stava&#x2019; and &#x2018;Kosack&#x2019; carried the wild type alleles for <italic>Rht-D1</italic> as well as for <italic>Rht-B1</italic>. In terms of plant height they ranked on position 227 and position 112 out of 372 varieties, which represented the medium range of plant height. This indicates that besides the absolute plant height other factors influenced by <italic>Rht-D1</italic> may affect the resistance behaviour.</p>
        <p>Early flowering varieties and varieties carrying the photoperiod insensitive <italic>Ppd-D1a</italic> mutant showed decreased resistance. Since the inoculation process was repeated three times during the flowering of the tested varieties, we assume that this procedure compensated for variation in the effectiveness of inoculation caused by variation in the flowering time of the varieties. The spring varieties flowered on average two days earlier than the winter varieties, however in both types of varieties there were early and later varieties. While early flowering varieties may have experienced more than one inoculation event, also the weather conditions at the time of flowering at the respective trial sites play a role and can influence the spread of disease. The high correlations of FHB score between independent trial sites indicated that the procedure used is reliable and reproducible concerning the ranking of varieties.</p>
        <p>A significant marker-trait association was detected for the <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> alleles based on FHB severity. Opposite effects were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Klahr1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Steiner1">[10]</xref> where early plants were more resistant. While these reports relate to bi-parental mapping populations, the observation in our data set may represent a population-inherent effect. The <italic>Ppd-D1a</italic> mutant allele was mainly observed in French varieties, since it has most impact in southern latitudes of Europe. On the other hand this germplasm often had higher susceptibility to FHB.</p>

        <title>Implications for plant breeding</title>
        <p>The use of genome wide marker association provides a comprehensive analysis of the FHB resistance QTL present in Central European germplasm. As phenotypic data we used a combination of type I (incidence) and type II (severity; spread) resistance, which provided a good estimation of practical field resistance. The overall resistance of a variety seems to be controlled by a relatively high number of loci with resistance decreasing or increasing effects. Nevertheless, several of the tested varieties showed a good general resistance to FHB in various environments. The observed additive effects of favourable and unfavourable alleles encourage strategies of QTL-pyramiding. The avoidance of susceptibility loci may also increase the general FHB resistance. Due to the high number of loci involved, breeding for quantitative FHB resistance will require strategies of genomic selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Heffner1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Tester1">[48]</xref>. The advent of novel genotyping and sequencing techniques will provide the necessary genomic tools for such attempts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Akhunov1">[49]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Poland1">[51]</xref>. At the present state of art, genome wide microsatellite data were useful in the discovery of marker-trait associations. This type of marker is also very suitable to follow the inheritance patterns of individual QTL incorporated into backcross breeding programs due to their multi-allelic nature. It will be interesting in future studies to compare the marker-trait associations of the multi-allelic microsatellite markers with those of bi-allelic SNPs.</p>

        <title>Plant material, field trials and disease evaluation</title>
        <p>A total of 358 European winter wheat varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties were evaluated in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057500.s008">Table S6</xref>). Spring wheat varieties and winter wheat varieties were sown at the same time. All varieties were grown in two locations in Germany during the season 2008/2009 (2009.AHL (Ahlum), 2009.CEC (Cecilienkoog)) and in two locations in the season 2009/2010 (2010.AHL, 2010.BOD (Halle-Bodenwerder)) with three complete replicates per location.</p>
        <p>Spray inoculations were performed with 50000 spores per ml of <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic> isolates (1/3 F.g.&#x2236;2/3 F.c.) using a water volume of 600 L/ha. Each wheat variety was inoculated on three dates at intervals of 3 days with the spore suspension. It was started at the beginning of flowering (at stage BBCH 61) and finished at the end of flowering (at stage BBCH 65/69). Since not all varieties flowered simultaneously, some experimental variation between early and later flowering varieties may exist. The experiment was designed so that each variety received at least one inoculation during its flowering time. To determine the variety resistance against <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight (FHB) the parameters incidence and severity were recorded. FHB incidence (Type I resistance) was visually rated as the percentage of infected spikes from 50 observed spikes per plot. Severity (Type II resistance) was rated as the percentage of infected area per spike of the infected spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057500-Mesterhzy1">[52]</xref>. Three assessments were performed in each trial site 20, 28 and 33 days after the first inoculation, except for 2009.CEC, where only two assessments could be performed (28 and 33 days after inoculation) due to low disease pressure. Three replications were conducted per genotype and environment. FHB incidence and FHB severity were each calculated as means of three replications and three assessments per genotype and environment. FHB score was calculated as (FHB incidence x FHB severity)/100 separate for each environment.</p>
        <p>The varieties were also evaluated for heading date and plant height in a companion study in eight different locations over the same two seasons.</p>

Principal coordinate analysis was performed in R using the function cmdscale.

        <title>Statistical analysis of phenotypic data</title>
        <p>Each year-location combination was considered as an environment in our study. For each environment, the FHB incidence value (Type I resistance), the FHB severity value (Type II resistance) and FHB score value (incidence*severity)/100 were calculated separately for every genotype. For each genotype, the arithmetic mean for phenotypic observations in three replications and three assessments per genotype were generated and results were used as the phenotypic data for association analysis. In addition, best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) across all four environments were estimated by assuming fixed genotypic effects. Since the datasets for all environments were complete, the BLUEs, in fact, equalled the arithmetic means across environments. The calculation was performed by GenStat 14<sup>th</sup> edition [VSN International, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK] using the &#x201C;Mixed Models REML&#x201D; module and the &#x201C;Linear Mixed Models&#x201D; function.</p>

        <p>For the calculation of genotype-phenotype associations, microsatellite data were converted into a bi-allelic data format, resembling SNP data. Each allele was considered as a single marker and genotypes were coded as &#x2018;A&#x2019;, when the variety possessed the allele and &#x2018;C&#x2019; otherwise. A minor allele frequency threshold of 3% (equalling 11 varieties) was set and alleles with a lower frequency were excluded from the analysis. After filtering process, 3176 alleles remained and were employed for the association mapping approach. The FHB incidence value, FHB severity value and FHB scores value were used as trait values. Marker-trait associations were calculated separately for the four environments and the BLUEs across all environments. Calculations were performed with the software packages GenStat 14<sup>th</sup> edition. In GenStat, the &#x201C;QTL analysis&#x201D; module and the &#x201C;Single trait association analysis&#x201D; function was utilized, and the kinship matrix was chosen as the relationship model.</p>
