      <abstract>
        <p>In a non-model staple crop like wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivumI</italic> L.), functional validation of potential drought stress responsive genes identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> could provide gene targets for breeding. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of genes of interest can overcome the inherent problems of polyploidy and limited transformation potential that hamper functional validation studies in wheat. In this study, three potential candidate genes shown to be involved in abiotic stress response pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were selected for VIGS experiments in wheat. These include <italic>Era1</italic> (enhanced response to abscisic acid)<italic>, Cyp707a</italic> (ABA 8&#x2019;-hydroxylase), and <italic>Sal1</italic> (inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase). Gene homologues for these three genes were identified in wheat and cloned in the viral vector barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) in the antisense direction, followed by rub inoculation of BSMV viral RNA transcripts onto wheat plants. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that VIGS-treated wheat plants had significant reductions in target gene transcripts. When VIGS-treated plants generated for <italic>Era1</italic> and <italic>Sal1</italic> were subjected to limiting water conditions, they showed increased relative water content, improved water use efficiency, reduced gas exchange, and better vigour compared to water-stressed control plants inoculated with RNA from the empty viral vector (BSMV<sub>0</sub>). In comparison, the <italic>Cyp707a</italic>-silenced plants showed no improvement over BSMV<sub>0</sub>-inoculated plants under limited water condition. These results indicate that <italic>Era1</italic> and <italic>Sal1</italic> play important roles in conferring drought tolerance in wheat. Other traits affected by <italic>Era1</italic> silencing were also studied. Delayed seed germination in <italic>Era1</italic>-silenced plants suggests this gene may be a useful target for developing resistance to pre-harvest sprouting.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Drought is a major problem that affects wheat production worldwide. Tolerance to water stress is a quantitative trait with a complex phenotype that is often confounded by plant phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Fleury <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Because of the complexity of water stress tolerance and the effect of other harsh environmental factors in the field, improvement of this trait has largely relied on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance under drought conditions. On the other hand, the application of genomic tools in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has produced large datasets of gene expression profiles that result from exposure to water stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Seki <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Experimental validation of candidate genes identified from such transcript profiling studies has identified genes that appear to contribute to plant performance under limiting water conditions in greenhouse studies. Two such genes are <italic>Era1</italic> and <italic>Cyp707a</italic>, which are both involved in abscisic acid (ABA) regulation in the abiotic stress pathway. <italic>Era1</italic> is a gene that encodes the &#x3B2;-subunit of farnesyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Cutler <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), whose loss of function in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> caused greater ABA-induced guard cell S-type anion-channel activation and a rapid increase in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. <italic>Era1</italic> mutation resulted in significantly tighter stomatal closure at a wide range of physiologically relevant ABA concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">Pei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Allen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Transgenic <italic>Brassica napus</italic> silenced for <italic>Era1</italic> showed enhanced ABA sensitivity as well as significant reduction in stomatal conductance and water transpiration under drought stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). <italic>Cyp707a</italic> is a catabolic gene encoding ABA 8&#x2019;-hydroxylase, an enzyme playing a key role in ABA catabolism and in controlling ABA levels in various aspects of the plant life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Kushiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Cyp707a</italic> gene reportedly degrades ABA during seed imbibition and dehydration stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Kushiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Saito <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). A T-DNA insertion mutant of <italic>Cyp707a3</italic>, which is the most abundantly expressed gene among the four <italic>Cyp707a</italic> members under stress conditions, exhibited elevated drought tolerance with a concomitant reduction in transpiration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Umezawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). A third gene is <italic>Sal1</italic>, an inositol polyphosphate1-phosphatase-encoding gene. <italic>Sal1</italic> was originally isolated from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> for its ability to complement a salt-sensitive yeast strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Quintero <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mutation of this gene has shown increased drought tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). <italic>Sal1</italic> acts as a negative regulator of predominantly ABA-independent and also ABA-dependent stress response pathways. As far as is known, none of these three genes have been experimentally proven to have a role in drought tolerance in wheat. Furthermore, wheat homologues for <italic>Sal1</italic> have not been identified prior to this study.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Homologous genes in different species may not have the same function due to the different course of evolution that each species has taken. The high frequencies of duplication and deletion events in the wheat genome make it difficult to predict the function of a gene in one species based on the function of the homologous gene in the other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Dubcovsky and Dvorak, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that while common regulatory mechanisms exist across species in response to abiotic stress, the conservation of the molecular response to dehydration across experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Mohammadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Aprile <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) is low due to variation in stress dynamics, stage of development and tissue analysed.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Functional validation of the role of genes in stress can be studied either by overexpression or downregulation. For gene overexpression studies, full-length sequence information and an efficient genetic transformation protocol are required. However, wheat has been the most recalcitrant cereal species to culture <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Shah <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Transformation in wheat is still confined mainly to a few responsive varieties with quite different transformation frequencies such as the model spring genotype &#x2018;Bobwhite&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Hu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). For downregulation studies, knockout mutants are used. Not only will this require a transformation step, but the functional redundancy of homeologous genes present in the other wheat genomes could complement the absence of gene expression resulting from a single gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Lawrence and Pikaard, 2003</xref>). This limitation can be overcome by generating double and triple mutants, although this process is cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, faster alternatives are required for functional gene analysis in polyploid wheat.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) provides an alternative strategy for gene functional analysis through the simultaneous knockdown of expression of multiple related gene copies. This is a technique that was first developed in dicots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Burch-Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and is based on post-transcriptional gene silencing of host sequences that are complementary to host-derived sequences contained in a recombinant viral vector inoculated on plants. VIGS was developed in barley using barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), a natural pathogen in this species and consisting of a tripartite genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Holzberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The usefulness of VIGS in wheat was first demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Scofield <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> and has now been used to study genes for resistance to pathogens and the Russian wheat aphid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Scofield <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Cloutier <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Van Eck <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). VIGS has not been used for characterization of water stress response genes in wheat.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The main objective of this study was to evaluate the roles of <italic>Era1</italic>, <italic>Cyp707a</italic>, and <italic>Sal1</italic> in the response of wheat to limiting water conditions using VIGS. Optimization of the VIGS protocol was required in order to accomplish this.</p>

        <p>PCR products used in the construction of silencing vectors were amplified from wheat cDNA using the VIGS primers listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Primers were designed using Primer3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000</xref>) and used to amplify a 297-bp fragment of <italic>Cyp707a</italic> (accession EU430344.1) and a 316-bp fragment of <italic>Era1</italic> (accession ABI74692). For identification of <italic>Sal1</italic> sequences in wheat, annotated <italic>Arabidopsis Sal1</italic> (TAIR accession 4010745380) sequences were screened against publicly available wheat expressed sequence tag sequences (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/wEST/">http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/wEST/</uri>) which were then assembled into one contig using CAP3 at a stringency level of 95% similarity over a 20-bp overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Huang and Madan, 1999</xref>). The assembled sequences were validated by PCR amplification of wheat cDNA followed by sequencing, resulting in a 1077-bp region. A PCR product of 275bp was generated from this 1077bp using primers listed in Table1.</p>

        <p>Plants in all treatment groups (water-stressed silenced plants, water-stressed viral control, non-silenced well-watered (WW), and non-silenced water-stressed (WS) plants) were tested for variation in photosynthetic gas exchange since the genes under consideration may have direct or indirect effects on stomatal opening/closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The level of water stress used was selected to cause immediate visible phenotypes to accommodate the transient nature of the VIGS assay. This led to all the water-stressed wheat seedlings looking wilted and chlorotic compared to well-watered plants. To carry out the gas exchange studies, this study used a higher light intensity compared to normal greenhouse light conditions to ensure that photosynthesis and transpiration were not light limited and that the difference in gas exchange among treatment plants is due to the effect of silencing stomatal conductance-regulating genes. The light intensity was set at 800 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> with a red/blue light source and the CO<sub>2</sub> level was set at 400 &#x3BC;mol mol<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. A portable, open flow, gas-exchange system (LCpro+, Opti-Sciences, Hudson, NH, USA) was used to record the gas exchange on the fifth fully expanded leaf.

        <p>Water stress was examined in terms of RWC and WUE at 14 dpi in all the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The RWC and WUE measurements indicate potential photosynthetic gain during a water stress period. The WUE values obtained were lower than typically observed in potted plants (usually in the range 0.6&#x2013;0.9g kg<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). This is most likely a result of the plants not getting sufficient light in the greenhouse during the winter when these experiments were carried out. This would have resulted in reduced photosynthesis and consequently low biomass gain. However, since all plants were grown under the same conditions, it was possible to compare plants in the different treatments. The non-silenced plants showed a drastic reduction in both WUE and RWC in the WS plants relative to the WW plants, which was expected. The WS plants also did not differ significantly from the water-stressed viral control, indicating that virus inoculation had no effect on these two measurements.

This led the authors to suggest that farnesylation is involved in basal defence. To study the potential for increased susceptibility in <italic>Era1-</italic>silenced wheat plants, two known wheat pathogenic bacterial strains (<italic>X. translucens</italic> B74 and B75) were tested for their increase or decrease in virulence against <italic>Era1-</italic>silenced wheat plants compared to non-silenced wheat plants under drought and well-watered conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study was undertaken to test whether single genes that have been shown to enhance drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> when mutated would have similar effects in wheat. Three genes, namely <italic>Era1</italic>, <italic>Cyp707a</italic>, and <italic>Sal1</italic>, that represent different abiotic stress pathways were selected. The VIGS technique offered the best approach for testing the function of these genes in wheat for several reasons. The most important reason is that VIGS does not require a transformation step, which is still technically challenging in wheat. The potential of homologous copies of a gene to compensate for the absence of a homologue that has been silenced can be overcome in VIGS. All endogenous mRNA with at least 80% similarity to the host-derived sequence contained in the viral vector are targets for degradation. While this is an advantage of VIGS, it is also a disadvantage in that the specific gene responsible for the effect is not known and would require further experiments.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">One concern of using VIGS for evaluating putative drought tolerance genes is the fact that environmental conditions used for stress induction might not favour viral replication leading to poor silencing. The stress protocol used in the present study involved initial exposure of silenced plants to an acclimation stress prior to exposure to severe stress. The viral inoculation was done at late evening on well-watered healthy plants and water stress was imposed gradually over 4 dpi by gradually withholding water. The initial adjustment time was important as the virus also imparts some level of stress on the plants. The protocol to characterize genes involved in the stress-recovery response involved inoculation of VIGS vector 4 days prior to water stress induction to coincide with higher transcript downregulation of targeted genes. The levels of silencing (from 2.6- to 22-fold) achieved for the targeted genes were comparable to other VIGS wheat studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Scofield <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Bruun-Rasmussen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Van Eck <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The consistent phenotype across the silenced plants also neutralized the concern of the stress response to BSMV masking the effect of water stress effects, suggesting that drought trait functional studies can be carried out by VIGS in wheat.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Of the three genes tested, only <italic>Era1</italic> and <italic>Sal1</italic> showed similar phenotypes in wheat upon loss of function as has been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). A possible role of regulation of stomatal conductance was indicated for the improved performance of <italic>Era1</italic>- and <italic>Sal1</italic>-silenced plants. Closed stomata has been suggested to lead to decreased photosynthesis and therefore decreased productivity for the plant in well-watered conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Farquhar and Sharkey, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Schulze, 1986</xref>). The present experiment observed improved WUE compared to the viral control water-stressed BSMV<sub>0</sub>-inoculated plants, indicating better dry weight production under limiting water condition for BSMV<sub><italic>Era1</italic></sub>- and BSMV<sub><italic>Sal1</italic></sub>-treated plants. A likely explanation is that plants which regulate the stomatal opening &#x2018;efficiently&#x2019; and conserve water can achieve larger biomass per gram of water used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Farquhar and Richards 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Araus <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In the case of <italic>Sal1</italic>, loss of function was reported to yield shorter and rounder leaves in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with an enhanced drought tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Umezawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Down-regulation of <italic>Sal1</italic> leads to constitutively increased ABA content in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). <italic>Sal1</italic> acts as a negative regulator of predominantly ABA-independent as well as ABA-dependent stress response pathways, such that its inactivation results in altered osmoprotectants, higher leaf RWC, and maintenance of viable tissues during prolonged water stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). This study also showed that reduced expression of <italic>Sal1</italic> in wheat resulted in increased RWC, and increased WUE, as well as improved vigour, suggesting a similar function of <italic>Sal1</italic> in wheat. No other unusual phenotype was observed except increased/accelerated tillering, which is difficult to interpret at this point due to limited understanding of the mode of action of <italic>Sal1</italic>.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Interestingly, the effect of silencing <italic>Cyp707a</italic> homologues in wheat was different from previous findings in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Loss of function of <italic>Cyp707a</italic> was reported to enhance drought tolerance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Umezawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Cyp707a</italic>-silenced wheat plants did not show any improvements in terms of dry weight, WUE, or RWC of silenced plants compared to water-stressed BSMV<sub>0</sub>-treated control plants under water stress. The differences in response between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and wheat plants to loss of function of <italic>Cyp707a</italic> may be due to differences in stress adaptation pathways between wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Another possible reason for the observed difference may have to do with the structure of the <italic>Cyp707a</italic> gene family in the two species. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the <italic>Cyp707a</italic> gene family consists of <italic>Cyp707a1</italic>&#x2013;<italic>Cyp707a4</italic>, all of which are upregulated in response to dehydration and subsequent rehydration, suggesting that the function of <italic>Cyp707a</italic> genes is redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Kushiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Although there is only one <italic>Cyp707a</italic> cDNA sequence reported for wheat (accession EU430344.1), with three copies amplified by PCR in hexaploid wheat in this study, it is possible that other copies of <italic>Cyp707a</italic> exist in wheat. The DNA sequences of these other copies could potentially be different enough to cause ineffective silencing using the VIGS construct used in this study, leading to compensation of gene function by the remaining active genes. This emphasizes the importance of having the wheat genome sequence information in attempts to functionally test <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene homologues in wheat.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Out of the three genes tested in this study, <italic>Era1</italic> appeared to be the most promising as a potential target for drought tolerance breeding in wheat. Mutations in <italic>Era1</italic> could be readily identified through TILLING, taking advantage of resources that already exist in wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Slade and Knauf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Uauy <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Because of the role of ABA in germination and dormancy, the present study tested <italic>Era1</italic>-silenced plants for germination rates. Indeed, <italic>Era1</italic>-silencing done at the booting stage resulted in a 6&#x2013;10-day delay in germination compared to non-silenced plants. This trait may provide a solution for tackling pre-harvest sprouting in wheat. Pre-harvest sprouting is a consequence of ABA deficiency and leads to loss of grain weight and a reduction in end-use quality of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Fang and Chu, 2008</xref>). While <italic>Era1</italic> has also been suggested to play a role in basal defence against bacteria and oomycytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Goritschnig <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), the <italic>Era1</italic>-silenced wheat plants showed similar phenotypes in response to bacterial infection as non-silenced wheat plants under both water stress and well-watered conditions. This implies that there is no fitness cost to <italic>Era1</italic>-silenced plants under favourable conditions. It would be interesting to further study the differences in the function of <italic>Era1</italic> in pathogen susceptibility between wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In conclusion, this study showed the involvement of <italic>Era1</italic> and <italic>Sal1</italic> in response to water deficit stress tolerance in wheat. This is the first report of VIGS being successfully used in wheat to functionally characterize genes thought to be involved in drought tolerance. The transient nature of VIGS did not deter from generating valuable observations for screening potential drought tolerant genes in wheat. One major strategy adopted by plants during drought tolerance is avoiding dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Serraj and Atlin, 2009</xref>). Results from the present study indicate that downregulation of genes which reduce stomatal conductance may be a useful strategy for enhancing drought tolerance in wheat, if the same results hold in the field.</p>
