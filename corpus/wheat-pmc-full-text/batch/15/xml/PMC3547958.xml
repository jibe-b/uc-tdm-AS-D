      <abstract>
        <p>Cuticular wax composition greatly impacts plant responses to dehydration. Two parallel pathways exist in Triticeae for manipulating wax composition: the acyl elongation, reduction, and decarbonylation pathway that is active at the vegetative stage and yields primary alcohols and alkanes, and the &#x3B2;-diketone pathway that predominates at the reproductive stage and synthesizes &#x3B2;-diketones. Variation in glaucousness during the reproductive stage of wheat is mainly controlled by the wax production genes, <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2</italic>, and wax inhibitor genes, <italic>Iw1</italic> and <italic>Iw2</italic>. Little is known about the metabolic and physiological effects of the genetic interactions among these genes and their roles in shifting wax composition during plant development. We characterized the effect of <italic>W1, W2, Iw1,</italic> and <italic>Iw2</italic> and analyzed their interaction using a set of six near-isogenic lines (NILs) by metabolic, molecular and physiological approaches. Loss of functional alleles of both <italic>W</italic> genes or the presence of either <italic>Iw</italic> gene depletes &#x3B2;-diketones and results in the nonglaucous phenotype. Elimination of &#x3B2;-diketones is compensated for by an increase in aldehydes and primary alcohols in the <italic>Iw</italic> NILs. Accordingly, transcription of <italic>CER4-6</italic>, which encodes an alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductase, was elevated 120-fold in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic>. <italic>CER4-6</italic> was transcribed at much higher levels in seedlings than in adult plants, and showed little difference between the glaucous and nonglaucous NILs, suggesting that <italic>Iw2</italic> counteracts the developmental repression of <italic>CER4-6</italic> at the reproductive stage. While <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2</italic> redundantly function in &#x3B2;-diketone biosynthesis, a combination of both functional alleles led to the &#x3B2;-diketone hydroxylation. Consistent with this, transcription of <italic>MAH1-9</italic>, which encodes a mid-chain alkane hydroxylase, increased seven-fold only in <italic>W1W2</italic>. In parallel with the hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketone production patterns, glaucousness was intensified and cuticle permeability was reduced significantly in <italic>W1W2</italic> compared to the other NILs. This suggests that both <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2</italic> are required for enhancing drought tolerance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The aerial organs of terrestrial plants are coated with an extracellular layer of hydrophobic lipids, termed cuticle. Produced by epidermal cells, the cuticle plays important roles in plant growth and development and, as the interface between sessile plants and the environments they live in, in the interaction with abiotic and biotic elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Shepherd1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Jenks1">[2]</xref>. Based on solubility in organic solvents, the cuticle is composed of insoluble cutin and soluble cuticular wax. Cutin, a cell wall-bound ester polymer of modified fatty acids and glycerol, serves as the backbone of the cuticle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Kolattukudy1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Nawrath1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Pollard1">[5]</xref>. Intracuticular wax is embedded in the underlying cutin framework and epicuticular wax is overlaid on the cutin matrix and intracuticular wax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Jenks1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Samuels1">[6]</xref>. Wax composition varies with developmental stage, between organs, and with genetic and environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Shepherd1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Nawrath1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Samuels1">[6]</xref>, causing the plant to be bluish-white (glaucous) or nonglaucous. Glaucousness is the visible form of densely distributed epicuticular wax crystallites.</p>
      <p>Our current knowledge of wax biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which is mainly derived from the model plant Arabidopsis, indicates that this process begins with the release of C<sub>16</sub> and C<sub>18</sub> fatty acids from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) by fatty acyl&#x2013;ACP thioesterase B (FATB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bonaventure1">[7]</xref> and their subsequent activation to CoA thioesters by a long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Schnurr1">[8]</xref>. The activated forms of these fatty acids are transferred from plastids to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are made available for fatty acid elongase (FAE), which extends them to very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). The FAE complex consists of four types of enzymes: &#x3B2;-keto acyl-CoA synthases (KCS), &#x3B2;-keto acyl-CoA reductase (KCR), 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydratase (HCD), and enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR). In Arabidopsis, <italic>ECERIFERUM 6</italic> (<italic>CER6</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Fiebig1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Hooker1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Millar1">[11]</xref> and <italic>KCS1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Todd1">[12]</xref> encode KCS and <italic>KCR1</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Beaudoin1">[13]</xref>, <italic>PAS2</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bach1">[14]</xref>, and <italic>CER10</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Zheng1">[15]</xref> encode KCR, HCD, and ECR, respectively.</p>
      <p>The resulting VLCFAs can be released from the FAE complex as free fatty acids, or converted either to primary alcohols by acyl reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Vioque1">[16]</xref> or to alkanes by acyl decarbonylation through an aldehyde intermediate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Samuels1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Cheesbrough1">[17]</xref> and further to secondary alcohols and ketones by hydroxylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Greer1">[18]</xref>. In the acyl reduction branch, fatty acyl-CoA reductase CER4 exclusively reduces VLCFAs to the corresponding primary alcohols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Rowland1">[19]</xref>, and wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (WSD1) uses the long-chain and very-long-chain primary alcohols and C<sub>16</sub> fatty acid for wax ester production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Li1">[20]</xref>. In the decarbonylation branch, CER1 physically interacts with the wax-associated protein CER3 and ER-localized cytochrome b5 isomers to catalyze the redox-dependent biosynthesis of alkanes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bernard1">[21]</xref>. Subsequently, midchain alkane hydroxylase 1 (MAH1), a cytochrome P450 enzyme, oxidizes the alkanes to generate secondary alcohols and ketones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Greer1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>All of the cuticular lipid species synthesized in the ER need to be deposited extracellularly. The ABC transporters ABCG12/CER5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Pighin1">[22]</xref> and ABCG11/WBC11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bird1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Panikashvili1">[24]</xref> are involved in exporting wax through the plasma membrane to the apoplastic space. A glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid transfer protein, LTPG, functions as part of the machinery, either as a regulatory component or by creating the appropriate conditions for cuticular lipid exportation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-DeBono1">[25]</xref>. Recent efforts have started to shed light on the regulatory network underlying wax production by identifying transcription factors involved in this process. Several transcription factors of the AP2/EREBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Aharoni1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Broun1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Zhang1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Zhang2">[29]</xref> and MYB family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Cominelli1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Vailleau1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Raffaele1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Seo1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Seo2">[34]</xref> regulate genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis.

More recently, screening of a rice T-DNA tagging population isolated a <italic>CER6</italic>/<italic>CUT1</italic> homolog, <italic>WSL1</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Yu1">[44]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>GL15,</italic> which encodes a transcription factor of the AP2 family and is involved in the transition from juvenile to adult leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Moose1">[45]</xref>, and <italic>OCL1,</italic> which encodes a HD-ZIP IV family transcription factor that activates a fatty acyl-CoA reductase and a putative wax transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Javelle1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Javelle2">[47]</xref>, were found to regulate cuticular wax biosynthesis.</p>
      <p>In the tribe Triticeae, including wheat and barley, the acyl elongation, reduction, and decarbonylation pathway for the synthesis of alcohol-rich waxes is active in the vegetative stages. A parallel pathway, which predominates in the reproductive stages, is responsible for biosynthesis of &#x3B2;-diketones, i.e., hentriacontane-14,16-dione and its hydroxyl derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tulloch1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Mikkelsen1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles1">[50]</xref>. The &#x3B2;-diketone pathway differs from the acyl elongation, reduction, and decarbonylation pathway in substrate and inhibitor specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Mikkelsen1">[49]</xref> and in pathway-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles2">[51]</xref>. Because &#x3B2;-diketones are not detected in wax extracts from the model plants Arabidopsis and rice, the &#x3B2;-diketone biosynthetic pathway draws much less attention.</p>
      <p>Common wheat or bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L) is an important, widely adapted crop that is cultivated in many arid or semiarid areas. The inheritance of wheat glaucousness is mainly governed by two sets of dominant genes, <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2,</italic> which promote glaucous formation, and <italic>Iw1</italic> and <italic>Iw2,</italic> which inhibit it. <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>Iw1</italic> are located on the short arm of chromosome 2B (2BS), and <italic>W2</italic> and <italic>Iw2</italic> on 2DS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tsunewaki1">[52]</xref>. Genetic mapping using molecular markers has localized the <italic>Iw1</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Simmonds1">[53]</xref> and <italic>Iw2</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Nelson1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Liu2">[55]</xref> to the distal regions of the chromosome arms. While the non-glaucous phenotype prevails in the wild diploid ancestors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tsunewaki1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Dudnikov1">[56]</xref>, the glaucous type predominates in cultivated polyploid wheat, suggesting that glaucousness was favored during wheat domestication. Field physiology studies showed that glaucousness is positively related to wheat yield, especially under drought-stressed conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richards1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richards2">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Monneveux1">[59]</xref>. Despite its adaptive importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying variation in glaucousness and its association with drought tolerance remain largely unknown. We characterized a set of six near isogenic lines (NILs) by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metabolite profiling of wax extracts, measuring the rate of water loss and chlorophyll efflux, and transcriptional profiling of 72 cuticle genes. Here, we report the results of this study and their implications in our understanding of cuticular wax pathways and drought tolerance.</p>

        <p>Six wax NILs were developed by ten backcrosses to wheat cultivar S-615 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tsunewaki1">[52]</xref> and their genotypes and glaucousness on flag leaf sheaths and peduncles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The NILs <italic>W1W2</italic>, <italic>W1w2,</italic> and <italic>w1W2</italic> are glaucous, whereas <italic>w1w2</italic>, <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> are not, indicating that <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2</italic> are functionally redundant in forming glaucousness, but that a single <italic>Iw</italic> gene is sufficient to suppress glaucousness formation. Before physiological, metabolic, and expressional characterization, we inspected the genetic background by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) genotyping. Of the 9,000 SNP probes assayed, over 5,200 produced positive signals in each line and 18 probes (0.35% of 5,200) or fewer detected polymorphisms among the NILs, suggesting that the NILs are identical over 99.5% of the genome. The lowest level of polymorphism was found between NILs <italic>W1W2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic>, where only one probe detected a polymorphism. We also genotyped the six NILs using SSR markers previously mapped at the tips of 2BS and 2DS arms, where the <italic>W</italic> and <italic>Iw</italic> genes are located. All of the NILs were positive for all SSR markers, indicating that the mutations were not caused by chromosome deletions. These results indicate that the NILs differ from each other only at a very small fraction of the genome and suggest that there are probably no polymorphisms in wax genes other than at the <italic>W</italic> and <italic>Iw</italic> loci.</p>

        <title>Wax Morphology</title>
        <p>When flowering begins at Fakes&#x2019; stage 10.5.1 (F10.5.1), glaucousness is fully developed in the upper part of the wheat plant. To gain insight into the organization of epicuticular wax, we examined the wax crystallites deposited on the abaxial surface of the flag leaf blades and sheaths, the peduncles, and the glumes of the NILs at this stage under SEM. The morphology of wax crystallites in glaucous NILs was clearly different from that of nonglaucous ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In all tissue types, the cuticle surfaces of glaucous NILs were covered with a meshwork of wax tubes, and the density was higher in <italic>W1W2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d</xref>) and <italic>W1w2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2e, 2f, 2g, and 2h</xref>) than in <italic>w1W2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2i, 2j, 2k, and 2l</xref>). Besides wax tubes, large wax sheets were also observed above the wax meshwork in the sheath and peduncle of the <italic>W1W2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2b and 2c</xref>). On the leaf cuticles of the <italic>w1W2</italic> plants, sparse wax tubes were seen over the ground cells, whereas fine wax granules densely covered the guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2i</xref>).</p>

        <p>In contrast to the glaucous NILs, the cuticles of the nonglaucous NILs were either smooth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2p</xref>) or carried fine wax particles. On the leaf cuticles, wax crystallites were mainly found over the guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2m, 2q, and 2u</xref>). However, the guard cells of glumes of the <italic>Iw</italic> NILs were devoid of wax crystallites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2t and 2x</xref>). Wax crystallites were distributed on both ground and guard cells in the sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2n, 2r and 2v</xref>) and peduncle cuticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2o, 2s and 2w</xref>).</p>
        <p>Wax morphology is determined by wax composition. The dramatic difference in wax morphology suggests possible differences in wax content, composition, and cuticle permeability between the glaucous and nonglaucous NILs. Considering that sheath wax morphology was a good indicator of the differences among the NILs, we concentrated our research on the sheath wax.</p>

        <title>Wax Composition</title>
        <p>We extracted cuticular wax from the flag leaf sheaths of the wax NILs at stage F10.5.1 and profiled it using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that &#x223C;90% of the wax extract consisted of known wax species and the remaining &#x223C;10% consisted of unknown species. As expected, the NILs varied greatly in total wax load and composition. All glaucous NILs carried the same wax load <italic>(P</italic>&gt;0.82980; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) and had a similar wax composition, with &#x3B2;-diketones accounting for &gt;60%, fatty acids and alkanes for &#x223C;15% each, primary alcohols for 2 to 4%, and cyclic lipids for trace amounts of total wax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figures 3b and 3c</xref>). Wax load varied by &#x223C;60% among the nonglaucous NILs. Compared to <italic>W1W2</italic>, no significant reduction was found in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<italic>P&#x200A;=&#x200A;</italic>0.42065); however, a 50% and 68% reduction was detected in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> (<italic>P&#x200A;=&#x200A;</italic>0.0412) and <italic>w1w2</italic> (<italic>P&#x200A;=&#x200A;</italic>0.01577), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). This indicates that wax composition, instead of wax load, determines glaucousness. In contrast to the glaucous NILs, &#x3B2;-diketones were depleted in the nonglaucous NILs, being reduced to &#x223C;8% of total wax species in <italic>w1w2</italic> (<italic>P&#x200A;=&#x200A;</italic>0.00925) and completely eliminated in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). There was little net increase in <italic>w1w2</italic> for the remaining components (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.12834), which elevated the alkane proportion to &#x223C;45% of the total wax species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3c</xref>), indicating that <italic>W</italic> genes are specific for &#x3B2;-diketone synthesis. In contrast to the situation in <italic>w1w2</italic>, loss of &#x3B2;-diketones in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> was compensated by an increase of aldehydes and primary alcohols. Compared to <italic>W1W2</italic>, aldehydes and primary alcohols were increased &#x223C;250-fold and &#x223C;10-fold in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic>, and &#x223C;600-fold and 20-fold in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic>, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.00254; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). This indicates that the <italic>Iw</italic> genes inhibit the synthesis of &#x3B2;-diketones and shunt their substrates to the fatty acyl reduction pathway. In this respect, the action of <italic>Iw2</italic> is much stronger than that of <italic>Iw1</italic>. As a result, three different types of waxes are recognized in this NIL set: &#x3B2;-diketone-rich wax in the glaucous NILs, alkane-rich wax in <italic>w1w2</italic>, and primary alcohol-rich wax in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast to the aliphatic wax species, cyclic wax species, such as sterols and triterpenes (ST&amp;TP) were detected at much lower levels. Compared to <italic>W1W2</italic>, ST&amp;TP, which mainly consisted of &#x3B2;-sitosterol and &#x3B2;-amyrin, were increased nine-fold in <italic>w1w2</italic> (<italic>P&#x200A;=&#x200A;</italic>0.0171; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Transcriptional Profiling of Cuticle Genes</title>
        <p>When flag leaves are fully emerged from the whorl (stage F9.0), flag leaf sheaths elongate rapidly. Because cuticle genes are highly expressed in the elongating epidermal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Suh1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richardson1">[61]</xref>, we selected flag leaf sheaths at this stage for transcription profiling. We chose nine candidate reference genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s005">Table S1</xref>) from previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Xue1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Paolacci1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Long1">[64]</xref> and validated their expression stability in 18 cDNA samples from the NIL set using programs qBase<sup>Plus</sup> (Biogazelle, Belgium) and NormFinder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Andersen1">[65]</xref>. Both programs demonstrated that <italic>TaRPII36</italic> was the best reference gene for quantifying cuticle gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The increase of aldehydes and primary alcohols in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> suggests that the <italic>Iw</italic> genes activate <italic>CER4</italic> homologs; the abundance of &#x3B2;-diketones in the glaucous NILs suggests that the <italic>W</italic> genes up-regulate special <italic>KCS</italic> homologs and the decarbonylation components and the <italic>Iw</italic> genes suppress them; and the presence of hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones only in <italic>W1W2</italic> suggests that the interaction between <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2</italic> activates <italic>MAH1</italic> homologs. To test these hypotheses, we profiled the transcription of wheat wax candidate genes with an emphasis on the <italic>CER1</italic>, <italic>CER3</italic>, <italic>CER4</italic>, <italic>KCS,</italic> and <italic>MAH1</italic> gene families. To test if cutin is also involved in the phenotype variation, we selected five cutin biosynthetic genes. We designed primers for 64 unigenes and adopted primers for eight additional genes from a previous publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Kosma1">[66]</xref>. Thus, we evaluated the transcription of 72 genes involved in cutin and wax biosynthesis, transport, and transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s005">Table S1</xref>). Compared with <italic>W1W2</italic>, the expression of 11 genes in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and 29 genes in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> was significantly altered, of which the expression patterns of seven genes were shared by <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s006">Table S2</xref>). Of these 72 genes examined, nine, including four <italic>CER4</italic> members, four <italic>MAH1</italic> members, and <italic>LTP4,</italic> showed over a two-fold difference in expression. The most dramatic change was observed in <italic>CER4-6</italic>, which was up-regulated &#x223C;120-fold in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> and 2.8-fold in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Searching the D-genome physical mapping database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://probes.pw.usda.gov/WheatDMarker">http://probes.pw.usda.gov/WheatDMarker</ext-link>) revealed that <italic>CER4-6</italic> is located on chromosome 5D. This indicates that <italic>CER4-6</italic> is not <italic>Iw2</italic> itself, which is located on chromosome 2D, but an <italic>Iw2</italic> target that possibly plays a role in increasing aldehyde and primary alcohol content. <italic>CER4-11</italic> was also up-regulated two-fold in both <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic>. In addition, four <italic>MAH1</italic> members, <italic>MAH1-4</italic>, <italic>MAH1-7</italic>, <italic>MAH1-8,</italic> and <italic>MAH1-9</italic>, were differentially expressed in <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s006">Table S2</xref>).

        <p>We further asked if the up-regulation of <italic>CER4-6</italic> was the result of activation or de-repression by <italic>Iw2</italic>.

Wax composition changed dramatically during wheat development, from alcohol-rich wax in the vegetative stage to &#x3B2;-diketone-rich wax in the reproductive stage, particularly in leaf sheaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tulloch1">[48]</xref>.

        <title>Cuticle Permeability</title>
        <p>Nonstomal transpiration is directly correlated with cuticle permeability. We evaluated the cuticle permeability of this NIL set by measuring the rates of water loss and chlorophyll efflux of the flag leaf sheaths at stage F10.5.1. Simultaneously, we inspected stomatal density and aperture size under a light microscope. All of the NILs had a similar stomal density, i.e., &#x223C;60 stomata in a field of view at a magnification of 10&#xD7;20, and most stomata were closed 1 h after detachment at room temperature and under lab conditions. Therefore, the differences observed in water-loss rate were presumably attributed to cuticle permeability.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Glaucousness is a classic genetic marker trait of wheat. Recent drought threat renewed interest in this trait. Despite several reports on the molecular mapping of <italic>Iw</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Simmonds1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Nelson1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Liu2">[55]</xref> and quantitative trait loci that affect glaucousness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bennett1">[67]</xref>, this is the first systematic characterization of wheat glaucousness. In this study, we combined SEM, metabolite profiling, gene expression profiling, and physiologic approaches in a near isogenic background to gain insight into the genetic regulation of cuticular wax biosynthesis and its perturbation during drought tolerance.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Wax Composition and Glaucousness</title>
        <p>Numerous cuticular wax genes were identified based on the loss- or reduction-of-glaucousness phenotypes, such as the <italic>cer</italic> mutants of Arabidopsis. The <italic>CER</italic> genes participate in almost all steps of cuticle biosynthesis, indicating that glaucousness formation requires multiple wax components. Comparative analyses of the cuticular wax profiles of glaucous and nonglaucous durum lines and of wheat aneuploids found that &#x3B2;-diketone was critical for glaucousness formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Barber1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bianchi1">[69]</xref>. Our research showed that wax composition is more important than wax load in glaucousness determination and that the nonglaucous NILs differ from the glaucous ones in terms of &#x3B2;-diketone content. <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> completely lacked &#x3B2;-diketones and <italic>w1w2</italic> exhibited a &#x223C;90% reduction in &#x3B2;-diketones. These findings confirm that &#x3B2;-diketones are essential for glaucousness formation. SEM observation also confirmed that wax composition was directly related to wax morphology: &#x3B2;-diketones form wax tubes in the glaucous NILs and primary alcohols form wax chips in the <italic>Iw</italic> NILs. The glaucous NILs and <italic>w1w2</italic> carried trace aldehydes and low levels of primary alcohols, suggesting that these wax species play a limited role in glaucousness formation.</p>
        <p>Compared to <italic>W1w2</italic> and <italic>w1W2</italic>, <italic>W1W2</italic> showed slightly higher levels of glaucousness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g001">Figure 1</xref>), but no difference in total &#x3B2;-diketone load. The major difference among the glaucous NILs is the presence of 8- and 9-hydroxyl &#x3B2;-diketones in <italic>W1W2</italic> and the absence of these hydroxy isomers in <italic>W1w2</italic> and <italic>w1W2</italic>. It is believed that hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketone is derived from &#x3B2;-diketone through mid-chain hydroxylation. In barley, this hydroxylation is defined by the <italic>cer-u</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles3">[70]</xref>. In the genus <italic>Triticum</italic>, 25-isomer is the typical hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketone in durum wax, but is substituted by 8- and 9-isomers in hexaploid wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bianchi2">[71]</xref>, suggesting that the generation of these substituted &#x3B2;-diketones involves the interaction of several genes. The absence of hydroxyl &#x3B2;-diketones in <italic>W1w2</italic> and <italic>w1W2</italic> suggests that the <italic>W1-W2</italic> interaction is required for &#x3B2;-diketone hydroxylation and that these substituted &#x3B2;-diketones are important for intensifying glaucousness and forming wax crystallite sheets in <italic>W1W2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g002">Figure 2b and 2c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Wax Pathways</title>
        <p>During plant development, multiple wax pathways operate in parallel to produce different wax types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Mikkelsen1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Bianchi3">[72]</xref>, and wax composition changes as plants develop and grow. In the Triticeae, primary alcohols and alkanes are the predominant wax species at the seedling stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richardson1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Kosma1">[66]</xref> and &#x3B2;-diketones are abundant at the reproductive stage, particularly in the sheaths and spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tulloch1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richardson1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles3">[70]</xref>. Genetic and biochemical studies in barley supported the existence of two parallel pathways, the acyl elongation, reduction, and decarbonylation pathway and the &#x3B2;-diketone pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles1">[50]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>CER-cqu</italic> of barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles2">[51]</xref> and in the <italic>W</italic> genes of wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3</xref>) specifically affect &#x3B2;-diketone synthesis. However, we know little about the cross-talk between these two pathways. In the present research, we identified three major types of waxes in a set of six NILs: alkane-rich wax in <italic>w1w2</italic>, alcohol-rich wax in the <italic>Iw</italic> NILs, and &#x3B2;-diketone-rich wax in the glaucous NILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). A survey of Triticeae species found that many wild species produce alcohol-rich wax at the reproductive stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tulloch2">[73]</xref>, implying that the <italic>Iw</italic> alleles prevail in nature and that the <italic>iw</italic> mutations led to the production of &#x3B2;-diketone-rich wax. The similar wax loads in <italic>W1W2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) suggest that precursors are shunted between the acyl reduction pathway and the &#x3B2;-diketone pathway by <italic>Iw2</italic>. Consistent with this, we found that expression of <italic>CER4-6</italic> was elevated 120-fold in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic>. The wax composition in the <italic>Iw</italic> NILs at the adult stage (F10.5.1) resembles that at the seedling stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tulloch1">[48]</xref>, being rich in primary alcohols and lacking &#x3B2;-diketones. Transcription quantification further demonstrated that <italic>CER4-6</italic> is active in the seedling stage (F4.0) in <italic>W1W2</italic>, <italic>Iw1iw2,</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). Expression of <italic>CER4-6</italic> was reduced in all three NILs at stage F9.0; however, the reduction was most pronounced in <italic>W1W2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). Similarly, expression of four FAE genes showed no difference between <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> and <italic>W1W2</italic> in the seedling stage, but was reduced at the adult plant stage to a much greater extent in <italic>W1W2</italic> than in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This suggests that the genes involved in the acyl elongation and reduction pathway are repressed by reproductive development and de-repressed by the <italic>Iw</italic> genes, which act as cross-talkers that regulate the acyl reduction and &#x3B2;-diketone pathway. <italic>Iw2</italic> maintains an active <italic>CER4-6</italic> at the reproductive stage and suppresses &#x3B2;-diketone production. It would be fascinating to determine how these two opposite activities are coupled by one gene. This is probably achieved by an interaction between <italic>Iw2</italic> and different sets of genes. Molecular cloning of <italic>Iw2</italic> and an in-depth analysis of <italic>CER4-6</italic> expression will provide insight into the developmental regulation of the wax composition shift.</p>
        <p>Much work has focused on the biosynthesis of &#x3B2;-diketones in barley by genetic and metabolic analyses of the <italic>cer</italic> mutants. Wax profiling found that <italic>cer-q</italic>, <italic>cer-c,</italic> and <italic>cer-u</italic> mutants define chain elongation, decarbonylation, and hydroxylation reactions in &#x3B2;-diketone synthesis, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles3">[70]</xref>. However, genetic analyses of these mutants in barley support the hypothesis that &#x3B2;-ketoacyl elongation, decarbonylation, and hydroxylation are carried out by one gene, <italic>cer-cqu</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles2">[51]</xref>. It is difficult to imagine how one gene might govern three different reactions. <italic>cer-cqu</italic> has been redesignated as <italic>gsh1</italic> and was mapped to the subtelomeric region of the barley chromosome arm 2HS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/bgn/26/BGS351">http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/bgn/26/BGS351</ext-link>), which is colinear to the <italic>W1</italic> locus in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Tsunewaki1">[52]</xref>. In the present research, we found that the <italic>W1</italic> and <italic>W2</italic> genes in wheat are each sufficient for the deposition of &#x3B2;-diketone and complement each other, but that both are required for the synthesis of hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones. One scenario would be that the <italic>W</italic> genes encode transcription factors belonging to the same family of proteins that activate the transcription of the &#x3B2;-diketone biosynthetic genes. We profiled 18 <italic>FAE</italic> genes; however, none of them were upregulated in the glaucous NILs. This is probably because &#x3B2;-diketones are synthesized by a separate enzyme system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles1">[50]</xref>, but that the genes tested were chosen based on their function in model plants, which do not synthesize &#x3B2;-diketones. The proposed &#x3B2;-diketone biosynthetic pathway includes a decarbonylation reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-vonWettsteinKnowles1">[50]</xref>. We examined the expression of eight <italic>CER1</italic> and five <italic>CER3</italic> members of the decarbonylation pathway, and found that only the expression of <italic>CER1-8</italic> was increased in <italic>w1W2</italic> (2.6-fold). To explore the possibility that <italic>MAH1</italic> participates in &#x3B2;-diketone hydroxylation, we evaluated the expression of eight <italic>MAH1</italic> members and found that <italic>MAH1-8</italic> matched the production pattern of hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g004">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g007">7</xref>). Compared to <italic>W1W2</italic>, transcription of <italic>MAH1-8</italic> was further elevated (&#x223C;10-fold) in <italic>iw1Iw2</italic>, but hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketone was not detected, because <italic>Iw2</italic> inhibits the biosynthesis of &#x3B2;-diketone, the substrate of hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones.</p>
        <p>The wheat <italic>W1</italic> gene resembles the barley <italic>cer-cqu</italic> locus in terms of chromosomal location and regulation of &#x3B2;-diketone synthesis and hydroxylation. Considering the close phylogenetic relationship between barley and wheat, <italic>cer-cqu</italic> is probably orthologous to <italic>W1</italic> and may also need to interact with other genes for &#x3B2;-diketone hydroxylation.</p>

        <title>&#x3B2;-Diketones and Drought Tolerance</title>
        <p>Previous physiological studies in wheat found that glaucousness significantly increased grain and biomass yield in irrigated and rainfed field experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Johnson1">[74]</xref>, and increased the photosynthesis to transpiration ratio and reduced the photosynthetic surface temperature in greenhouse experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richards2">[58]</xref>. Glaucousness significantly reduced transpiration at night, which caused a relatively greater reduction in transpiration than photosynthesis and the increase of water-use efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Richards2">[58]</xref>. In the present research, we measured cuticle permeability in terms of water loss and chlorophyll leaching in six NILs of four wax genes, and profiled their wax composition and inspected their wax morphologies. This allowed us to compare the effect of the individual genes and to analyze their interaction. We found that cuticle traits are closely associated with wax composition, mainly with respect to the &#x3B2;-diketones. The nonglaucous NILs had little or no &#x3B2;-diketones and showed significantly higher water-loss and chlorophyll-leaching rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g008">Figures 8a and 8b</xref>). A small but significant effect was also seen for other wax species. Although <italic>Iw1iw2</italic> and <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> had similar chlorophyll-leaching rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g008">fig. 8b</xref>), the former had a higher water-loss rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g008">Figure 8a</xref>), probably because <italic>iw1Iw2</italic> wax had a significantly higher content of primary alcohols, aldehydes, and alkanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Cuticle trait differences were also observed among the glaucous NILs. <italic>W1w2</italic> and <italic>w1W2</italic> had higher chlorophyll-leaching and water-loss rates than <italic>W1W2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054129-g008">Figures 8c and 8d</xref>). The most significant difference in the glaucous NILs in terms of wax composition is the presence of 8- and 9-hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones in <italic>W1W2</italic>, suggesting a role of these hydroxyl isomers in reducing cuticle permeability and improving drought tolerance. Compared to &#x3B2;-diketone, the hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones were much less abundant in the sheath wax. It is hard to imagine how hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones reduce cuticle permeability. One explanation is that the addition of hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones may underlie the changes in wax crystal organization of <italic>W1W2</italic> (e.g., the formation of wax crystal sheets), which result in reduced water loss and chlorophyll efflux. We hypothesize that the hydroxyl-&#x3B2;-diketones function as the &#x201C;glue&#x201D; that cross-links the &#x3B2;-diketone tubes via the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl and keto groups. Application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization&#x2013;MS imaging to the NILs and re-crystallization analysis of combinations of &#x3B2;-diketone and substituted &#x3B2;-diketone at different ratios may shed light on this possibility.</p>
        <p>Glaucousness is an adaptive trait to dry cultivation conditions and will play an important role in developing cuticle-based strategies to improve drought tolerance. The <italic>Iw</italic> genes have a negative impact on drought tolerance and need to be eliminated from wheat breeding programs. Due to the dominant mode of inheritance, <italic>Iw</italic>-mediated nonglaucousness can be eradicated by one selection in early generations. The manipulation of the <italic>W</italic> genes is more challenging. Our results indicate that one <italic>W</italic> gene is sufficient to restore glaucousness, but not to prevent nonstomal transpiration. Therefore, both <italic>W</italic> genes are required for enhancing drought tolerance. In this respect, marker-assisted selection will help improve breeding efficiency. To this end, user-friendly molecular markers tightly linked to the <italic>W</italic> genes need to be developed. Molecular mapping and cloning of these <italic>W</italic> genes will open novel routes to manipulate cuticle permeability for drought tolerance.</p>

        <title>Microscopic Observation</title>
        <p>Stoma counting and aperture observations were performed using an imprinted slide. Briefly, both sides of flag leaf sheaths were coated with 10% cellulose acetate dissolved in acetone using a paint brush. When dried, the cellulose acetate film (&#x223C;2&#xD7;1 cm) was carefully peeled, mounted on a slide, covered with a cover glass, and observed using a light microscope at a magnification of 10&#xD7;20. Two imprints were taken from each side of the sheath and three independent inspections were carried out on each of the imprints.</p>
        <p>For SEM imaging of cuticle surfaces, a 0.5-cm tissue fragment was harvested from the base of the flag leaf, the uppermost part of the flag leaf sheath, and the peduncle, and glumes were collected from the spikelets in the middle of spikes at anthesis (F10.5.1). The tissue samples went through 10 glycerol gradients, from 10% to 100%, with 2 h in each glycerol solution, to replace the cellular water. The pretreated samples were sputtered with gold powder using the CrC-150 Sputtering System, and inspected with a Hitachi S-3400N SEM (Hitachi). Images were captured with the voltage set at 5 kV.</p>

        <title>GC-MS Profiling of Wax Composition</title>
        <p>Cuticular wax was extracted from two flag leaf sheaths of similar age from the same plant by submerging tissues in a glass tube containing 10 ml of HPLC grade chloroform (Fisher Scientific) and 4 &#xB5;g of tetracosane (Sigma-Aldrich) as an internal standard and agitating manually for 1 min. The tissue was rinsed with an additional 5 ml of chloroform, and the two extracts were combined. The wax extract was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene filter with a 10-mL SGE syringe (Supelco) into a new glass tube and dried under a nitrogen stream. The dried wax was resuspended in 500 &#xB5;l of acetonitrile and silylation was performed in 6% bis-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide and 10% trimethyl-chlorosilane at 80&#xB0;C for 30 minutes to transform the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups into trimethylsilyl derivatives. The suspension was concentrated to 200 &#xB5;l, and 1 &#xB5;l was used for GC-MS analysis. Six biological replicates were included for each genotype. Wax silylation, GC-MS profiling, and substance identification were performed at the W.M. Keck Metabolomics Research Laboratory of Iowa State University (Ames, IA) on a fee-for-service basis.</p>

        <title>Quantification of Cuticle Traits</title>
        <p>To evaluate the effect of cuticular wax on water loss rate, flag leaf sheaths were excised from wheat plants at stage F10.5.1, dehydrated for 12 h at room temperature with a relative humidity of 44%, and weighed every hour using an analytical balance with a readability of 0.001 mg. The dry weight of tissues was measured after incubation at 37&#xB0;C for 72 h. For the chlorophyll efflux assay, a flag leaf sheath was placed in a 50-ml tube containing 30 ml of 80% ethanol and the tube was gently agitated on a rotator at 50 rpm. A 150-&#xB5;l aliquot of chlorophyll extract was transferred to a well in a microplate for quantification and then returned to the same tube. Absorbance was measured at 647 and 664 nm using a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek) and total chlorophyll micromoles were calculated as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054129-Lolle1">[75]</xref>. Two measurements were adopted as technical replicates and four biological replicates were included for both experiments.</p>

        <title>Transcription Quantification</title>
        <p>Wheat cuticle gene homologs were identified by BLASTn searches of the wheat gene index database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi">http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi</ext-link>) using known wax gene sequences as queries. The maximal cut-off value was set at E-20. qPCR primers were designed using the Primer3 program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/">http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/</ext-link>), with the PCR product size ranging from 80 to 200 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054129.s005">Table S1</xref>). Total RNA was isolated from flag leaf sheaths using Trizol&#xAE; reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. After RNA integrity evaluation by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantification using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific), 1 &#xB5;g of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis in a 20-&#xB5;l reaction using the QuantiTect Rev Transcription Kit (Qiagen). After dilution, &#x223C;5 ng of cDNA was used as template for qPCR in a volume of 20 &#xB5;l. qPCR was performed in 96-well plates with an ABI 7900HT High-Throughput Real-Time Thermocycler (Life Tech) using the iTaq&#x2122; Fast SYBR&#xAE; Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad). Two technical and four biological replicates were included for each NIL. The comparative &#x394;&#x394;CT method was used to evaluate the relative quantities of each amplified product using <italic>TaRPII36</italic> as an internal reference in the same run. PCR specificity was determined by melt curve analysis of the amplified products.</p>
