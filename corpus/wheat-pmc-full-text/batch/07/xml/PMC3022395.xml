      <abstract>
        <p>Sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) plays a key role in the plant stress signalling transduction pathway via phosphorylation. Here, a SnRK2 member of common wheat, <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic>, was cloned and characterized. Southern blot analysis suggested that the common wheat genome contains three copies of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic>. Subcellular localization showed the presence of TaSnRK2.7 in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Expression patterns revealed that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> is expressed strongly in roots, and responds to polyethylene glycol, NaCl, and cold stress, but not to abscisic acid (ABA) application, suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> might participate in non-ABA-dependent signal transduction pathways. <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> was transferred to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under the control of the CaMV-35S promoter. Function analysis showed that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> is involved in carbohydrate metabolism, decreasing osmotic potential, enhancing photosystem II activity, and promoting root growth. Its overexpression results in enhanced tolerance to multi-abiotic stress. Therefore, <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> is a multifunctional regulatory factor in plants, and has the potential to be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Reversible protein phosphorylation is central to the perception of, and response to, water deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirt, 1997</xref>), and constitutes a major mechanism for the control of cellular functions, such as responses to hormonal, pathogenic and environmental stimuli, and control of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>
      <p>The sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1) protein kinase family, belonging to the CDPK&#x2013;SnRK superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hrabak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), currently comprises SNF1 in yeast, AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPKs) in mammals, and SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) in higher plants. According to sequence similarity, domain structure, and cellular function, the plant SnRK subfamily can be divided into three subgroups, SnRK1, SnRK2, and SnRK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hrabak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). SnRK1 kinase is well characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels, and evidence indicates that SnRK1s play an important role in regulating carbon metabolism and sucrose signals in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halford and Hardie, 1998</xref>). Unlike SnRK1, SnRK2 and SnRK3 are unique to plants and are involved in responses to environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halford and Hey, 2009</xref>). Several SnRK3 members have been extensively characterized. The best known member, <italic>SOS2</italic>, participates in ionic homeostasis to high salt stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halfter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>SOS2</italic> and <italic>PKS3</italic> (<italic>SOS2</italic>-like protein kinase) interacted specifically with abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitive 2 (<italic>ABI2</italic>) phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Therefore, it was suggested that the SnRK3 family might be part of a calcium-responsive regulatory loop controlling ABA sensitivity or might function as a cross-talk node in complex signalling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Increasing evidence shows that SnRK2 genes play important roles in abiotic stress responses in plants. The first two SnRK2s in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>ASK1</italic> and <italic>ASK2</italic>, were cloned in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Until now, 10 SnRK2s have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; nine of them were activated by hyperosmotic and salinity stresses, and five of the nine were activated by ABA, whereas none was activated by cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>AtSnRK2.8/AtSnRK2C</italic> led to enhanced drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <italic>AtSRK2.6/AtSnRK2E/OST1</italic> was involved in ABA regulation of stomatal closing and ABA-regulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In rice, 10 members were identified and designated <italic>SAPK1&#x2013;10</italic>. All were activated by hyperosmotic stress, and <italic>SAPK8&#x2013;10</italic> were also activated by ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>SAPK4</italic> significantly enhanced salt tolerance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diedhiou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Recently, 10 maize SnRK2 members were cloned, and most <italic>ZmSnRK2s</italic> were induced by one or more abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In wheat, an SnRK2 member, <italic>PKABA1</italic>, was induced by ABA and dehydration stress, and it repressed the activity of gibberellic acid-inducible promoters when transiently overexpressed in barley aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderberg and Walker-Simmons, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gomez-Cadenas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In our recent study, the wheat <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> gene, expressed strongly in booting spindles compared with leaves, roots, and spikes, was induced by multi-stresses and ABA application. Overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> resulted in delayed seedling establishment, longer primary roots, and enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Although evidence shows that SnRK2s function in abiotic stress signalling in plants and are activated very rapidly in response to osmotic stress, knowledge of specific functions of SnRK2s is fragmentary.</p>
      <p>In this study, we isolated <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> and characterized its expression pattern under diverse environmental stresses and in various wheat tissues. Transgenic experiments indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> significantly increased tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

        <p>Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) genotype &#x2018;Hanxuan 10&#x2019; with a conspicuous drought-tolerant phenotype was used in this study. Wheat seedling growth conditions and stress treatment assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). To study the expression of the target gene at different developmental stages, wheat seedling leaves and roots, spindle leaves at booting, and spikes at the heading stage were sampled. Seedlings were grown in a growth chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and spindle leaves at jointing and spikes were sampled from field plots without environmental stress.</p>
        <p>To probe copy number of the target gene, four plant accessions, including hexaploid wheat cultivar &#x2018;Hanxuan 10&#x2019; (AABBDD), and three diploid species, including <italic>Triticum urartu</italic> (AA, accession number 1010004), <italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic> (SS, putative B genome donor species, accession number IcAG 400046), and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> (DD, accession number PH1878) were selected to perform Southern blot analysis.</p>

        <title>Cloning the full-length <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> cDNA and sequence analysis</title>
        <p>Tissues from wheat seedlings at various stages and from mature plants were collected to extract total RNA with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Based on the candidate expressed sequence tag of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> from the cDNA library established in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), the putative full-length <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> cDNA was obtained by <italic>in silico</italic> cloning. To obtain full-length <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> cDNA, a pair of primers (F: 5&#x2032;-CCCAATCTTCGCCTCTGCC-3&#x2032;, R: 5&#x2032;-TTTATCCCCGGTCTGTGGCC-3&#x2032;) were designed based on the lateral flanking sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) of the putative sequence.</p>
        <p>Database searches of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were performed through an NCBI/GenBank/Blast search. Sequence alignments and similarities with other species were determined by the megAlign program in DNAStar. The signal sequence was predicted with SignalP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP">http://genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP</ext-link>). The functional region and activity sites were identified using the PROSITE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/prosite.html">http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/prosite.html</ext-link>) and SMART motif search programs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://coot.embl-heidelberg.de/SMART">http://coot.embl-heidelberg.de/SMART</ext-link>). To probe the relationship of TaSnRK2.7 and SnRK2 proteins from other plant species, the PHYLIP software package was used to construct a phylogenetic tree.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA was separately digested overnight with restriction enzymes <italic>Eco</italic>RV, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, and <italic>Nco</italic>I. The digested fragments were fractionated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels at 1.5 V cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for 8&#x2013;10 h, and then blotted to nylon membranes (Hybond N<sup>+</sup>; Amersham) overnight in 20&#xD7; saline&#x2013;sodium citrate (SSC). A fragment (800 bp) of the genome sequence of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> labelled with [&#x3B1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP was used as the probe. After UV cross-linking, the blotted membrane was hybridized overnight at 65 &#xB0;C in 50&#xD7;Denhardt's solution. The membrane was sequentially washed with 2&#xD7;SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS); 0.2&#xD7;SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1&#xD7;SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 &#xB0;C. The hybridized blot was exposed to a phosphor screen (Kodak-K) at room temperature, and the signals were captured using the Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad).</p>

        <p>The ORF of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> was fused upstream of the green fluorescent protein gene (<italic>GFP</italic>) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and NOS terminator in the pJIT163 expression vector. Proper restriction sites were added to the 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;-ends of the coding region by the PCR method. F: 5&#x2032;-GAGA<bold>GGTCTC<italic>AAGCTT</italic></bold>ATGGAGAGGTACGAGCTGCTCA-3&#x2032; (<italic>Bsa</italic>I site in bold, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII site in bold italics), R: 5&#x2032;-GAGA<bold>GGTCTC<italic>GGATCC</italic></bold>GCCGCTGGCACGGACC-3&#x2032; (<italic>Bsa</italic>I site in bold, <italic>Bam</italic>HI site in bold italics). The PCR product obtained was digested with <italic>Bsa</italic>I, and then ligated with the pJIT163-GFP plasmid cut with the corresponding enzyme to create recombinant plasmids for expressing the fusion protein. Positive plasmids were confirmed by endonuclease digest analysis, and then followed by sequencing. The recombinant constructs were transformed into living onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment with a GeneGun (BioRad Helios&#x2122;) according to the instruction manual (helium pressure, 150&#x2013;300 p.s.i.). After incubation in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium at 28 &#xB0;C for 36&#x2013;48 h, the onion cells were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leika TCS-NT). The images obtained were recorded automatically. The recombinant constructs and the control pJIT163-GFP plasmid were bombarded into 20 onion epidermal segments.</p>

        <title>Expression patterns of TaSnRK2.7</title>
        <p>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression patterns of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in wheat. A <italic>tubulin</italic> transcript was used to quantify the relative transcript levels. qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate with an ABI PRISM&#xAE; 7000 system using the SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems). Specific primers (RT-PCR, F: 5&#x2032;-CCCAATCTTCGCCTCTGCC-3&#x2032;, R: 5&#x2032;-TTTATCCCCGGTCTGTGGCC-3&#x2032;; qRT-PCR, F: 5'-CGGGGAGAAGATAGACGAGAATG-3&#x2032;; R: 5&#x2032;- CTCAAAAAGCTCACCACCAGATG -3&#x2032;) were designed according to the cDNA sequence. The relative level of gene expression was detected using the 2<sup>&#x2013;&#x394;&#x394;<italic>C</italic>T</sup> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Livaka and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). &#x394;&#x394;<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> = (<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Tubulin</sub>)<sub>Time <italic>x</italic></sub>&#x2013; (<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Tubulin</sub>)<sub>Time 0</sub>. The <italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> (cycle threshold) values for both the target and internal control genes were the means of the triplicate independent PCRs. Time <italic>x</italic> is any treated time point (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h) and Time 0 represents the initial untreated time (0 h).</p>
        <p>To detect the transcription level of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in different organs, the expression of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in seedling leaves was regarded as a standard because of its lowest expression, and the corresponding formula was modified as &#x394;&#x394;<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> = (<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Tubulin</sub>)<sub>DST</sub>&#x2013;(<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T, Tubulin</sub>)<sub>SL</sub>. DST refers to the developmental stage tissue and SL, the seedling leaf. To identify the relative expression of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>actin</italic> transcript of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was used to quantify the expression levels, and the transgenic line with lowest expression was regarded as a standard.</p>

        <title>Features of TaSnRK2.7 seedlings under cold and hyperosmotic stress, and ABA application</title>
        <p>Both wild-type and transgenic seeds were germinated on MS medium solidified with 0.8% agar. Seven-day-old seedlings were planted on MS medium containing 5% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, or 5 &#x3BC;M ABA, and then cultured in growth chambers (22 &#xB0;C, 70% humidity, 150 &#x3BC;M m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle). For cold stress assays, seedlings planted on MS medium were cultured in a low-temperature growth chamber (4 &#xB0;C, 70% humidity, 150 &#x3BC;M m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle). Seedlings cultured on MS medium under normal growth conditions were used as control. Plates were placed vertically to keep the root tips pointing upwards. Green cotyledons (%) and biomass (g) were recorded. Ten plants of each line were collected as a sample for biomass measurement.</p>

        <title>Abiotic stress tolerance assays</title>
        <p>Seven-day-old seedlings were planted in a sieve-like plate containing mixed soil (vermiculite:humus 1:1) and cultured normally in the greenhouse. The plants were exposed to various stresses at designated time points. For drought tolerance assays, the seedlings were cultured in a greenhouse (22 &#xB0;C, 70% humidity, 150 &#x3BC;M m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) without watering until phenotypic differences were evident between transgenic plants and controls, and then rewatered. For salt stress assays, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings were cultured as described above. Water was withheld for 3 weeks and then plants were well irrigated with NaCl solution (300 mM) applied from the bottom of the plates. For cold stress, the plants were transferred to a low-temperature growth chamber (4 &#xB0;C) after culturing in a normal growth chamber for 1 week.</p>

        <title>Measurement of total soluble sugars</title>
        <p>Total soluble sugars were determined as fructose equivalents using the anthrone colorimetric assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yemm and Willis, 1954</xref>) at 620 nm with a spectrophotometer (LG-721; BioRad). After detaching from roots, 4-week-old plants were put into liquid nitrogen immediately and dehydrated in a refrigerated vacuum evaporator at 8.1 kPa air pressure and &#x2013;60 &#xB0;C for 24 h. After dehydration, samples were dried at 80 &#xB0;C to a constant dry weight (DW). Extractions were performed with 0.1 g of dry material for each sample with three replications. Samples were boiled in 4 ml of double distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) for 4 min. After filtration the extracted filtrates were transferred to volumetric flasks (5 ml) and brought to 5 ml by addition of ddH<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

        <title>Cell membrane stability</title>
        <p>Plant cell membrane stability (CMS) was determined with a conductivity meter (DDS-1, YSI), CMS (%) = (1&#x2013;initial electrical conductivity/electrical conductivity after boiling)&#xD7;100. Twelve 7-d-old seedlings (grown on 1&#xD7;MS medium, 0.8% agar) were placed on filter paper saturated with NaCl (300 mM) solution. When signs of stress began to appear on WT plants, seedlings were collected immediately and rinsed thoroughly with ddH<sub>2</sub>O before immersion in 20 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O at room temperature. Initial conductivities were recorded 2 h later, and then the samples were boiled for 30 min, cooled to room temperature, and final conductivities were measured.</p>

        <title>Water retention ability</title>
        <p>Water retention ability (WRA) was measured as follows: ten 4-week-old stressed plants of similar size in each line were detached from roots, immediately weighed (fresh weight, FW), then desiccated under controlled conditions (45&#x2013;50% relative humidity and 25 &#xB0;C) and weighed at designated time intervals (desiccated weight). Finally, the plants were oven-dried to a constant DW for 24 h at 80 &#xB0;C. WRA was measured according to the formula: WRA (%) = (desiccated weight&#x2013;DW)/(FW&#x2013;DW)&#xD7;100. Stress conditions were the same for salt tolerance assays in soil. WRA was measured 24 h later after high-salt stress.</p>

        <title>Molecular characterization of TaSnRK2.7</title>
        <p>The <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> cDNA was 1196 bp in length, including a 1074 bp ORF, a 73 bp 5&#x2032;-untranslated region (UTR), and a 49 bp 3&#x2032; UTR. The ORF of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> encodes 357 deduced amino acid residues (AARs) with a calculated molecular mass of 42 kDa and a predicted p<italic>I</italic> of 5.47. Using a BLASTN search of the NCBI database, the deduced amino acid sequence showed homology with counterpart SnRK2 family members, namely, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic>, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). TaSnRK2.7 has 94% identity to OsSAPK7 (NP_001052827), 87% to ZmSnRK2.7 (ACG50011), and 78% to AtSnRK2.7 (AAM65503). Scansite analysis indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> has potential serine/threonine protein kinase activity, and like other <italic>SnRK2s</italic>, it has two domains in its N- and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal catalytic domain (4&#x2013;260 AARs) is highly conserved, containing an ATP binding site (10&#x2013;33 AARs) and protein kinase activating signature (119&#x2013;131 AARs). Additionally, in the catalytic domain one potential N-myristoylation site GVsyCH (110&#x2013;115 AARs) and one potential transmembrane-spanning region (183&#x2013;220 AARs) were found. The relatively short C-terminal domain is abundant in Glu (E), and is predicted to be a coiled coil. Compelling evidence indicated that the C-terminal domain might have roles in kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harmon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), participation in protein&#x2013;protein interactions mainly involved in ABA responsiveness, and possibly in ABA signal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>

        <title>TaSnRK2.7 plants exhibit enhanced multi-abiotic stress tolerance at the seedling stage</title>
        <p>An appropriate OP is vital to normal growth of plants and directly affects the water uptake of roots. The primary roots of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, like most plants, are positively gravitropic and sensitive to osmotic stress; therefore, gravitropic growth is an effective indicator of plant vigour under stress conditions. Under normal conditions there was no phenotypic difference between <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Under severe osmotic stress <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants grew slowly, and roots of some plants began to grow downwards, whereas all the WT and GFP plants stopped growing, and most of the control plants began to bleach and died within 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, C). Under cold stress, <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants were much more vigorous than the controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>, the roots of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants grew downwards earlier and were bigger than the controls. Statistical analysis of green cotyledons and biomass showed that the green cotyledons (%) and FW of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> seedlings were significantly higher than those of the controls under stress (except the green cotyledons under cold stress) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

To identify the cell membrane stability (CMS) of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic>-overexpressing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under stress, 7-d-old seedlings were treated with NaCl (300 mM) solution on filter paper. Symptoms of salt stress began to appear on WT and GFP plants 5 h after NaCl treatment, but no signs of stress were evident on <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9A</xref>). CMS levels in transgenic lines were significantly higher than in the two controls (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), strongly indicating that overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> increased CMS of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To assess WRA of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic>-overexpressing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under stress, six transgenic lines were selected to perform a 7-h detached-rosette water loss rate assay. Compared with plants, The six transgenic lines showed higher WRA than the WT and GFP control plants (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To maintain a stable intracellular environment in the presence of external environmental stress many plants decrease their cellular OPs through accumulation of intracellular organic osmolytes such as proline, glycine betaine, mannitol, and trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu, 2002</xref>). OP analysis results showed that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants had significantly lower OP than WT and GFP (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) under normal conditions, and no OP difference was detected between WT and GFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9C</xref>). The leaf tips of WT and GFP controls began to crimple 1 d after salt stress (300 mM NaCl), whereas no phenotypic change was evident on <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation is one of the central signalling events occurring in response to environmental stress in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In this study, we identified an osmotic-stress-activated protein kinase gene, <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic>, in common wheat. N-terminal myristoylation and transmembrane-spanning regions are essential for protein function in mediating membrane associations and protein&#x2013;protein interactions in plant responses to environmental stress (Podel and Gribstov, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishitani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In our research, an N-terminal myristoylation and one potential transmembrane-spanning region were identified. In plants these might be involved in interaction of proteins and participate in response to abiotic stress. In yeast, SNF1 kinase was localized to the nucleus, vacuole, and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vincent <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and involved in signal transduction pathways by interacting with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to activate transcription of glucose-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuchin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The presence of TaSnRK2.7 in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus in the present study suggested that TaSnRK2.7 might have different functions in wheat. More effort should be made to determine the signal transduction pathway and detailed location of this enzyme to facilitate an understanding of adaptive cellular mechanisms in stressed plants.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>AtSRK2.8/AtSRK2C</italic> was identified as a root-specific protein kinase, and <italic>AtSRK2.6/AtSRK2E/OST1</italic> was confirmed to play a pivotal role in stomatal closure in leaves, suggesting that different SnRK2 members have different roles in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> showed <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> strongly expressed in booting spindles. Our evidence showed that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> was expressed highly in seedling roots, suggesting that it might act as a fundamental signalling molecule of water and/or nutrient status in soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>
      <p>Numerous studies demonstrate that the SnRK2 family is involved in response to multi-environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). During the study, we detected dynamic expression of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> under PEG, salt, and cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> is involved in the cross-talk of multi-environmental stress responses. Significant differences in expression level and diverse response times indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> was very sensitive to NaCl and PEG stresses, but not activated by ABA application. To extend our understanding of the exact functions of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic>, further effort should be directed at deciphering the biological role and function of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in non-ABA-dependent signal transduction pathways.</p>
      <p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in plants under abiotic resistance, fused <italic>TaSnRK2.7&#x2013;GFP</italic> was overexpressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Growth retardation often occurs in transgenic plants and severely restricts the utilization potential of target genes in plant breeding. To assess the feasibility of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in transgenic breeding, morphological traits were closely monitored throughout the entire growth period. The results clearly demonstrated that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> overexpression does not retard plant growth, but it does improve development of the root system, which should benefit the uptake of water and nutrients under osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Growing evidence indicated that genes included in SnRK2 subclasses II and III may be related to seed germination and/or ABA-regulated stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In a recent study <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, included in subclass I was activated by ABA and involved in seed development and dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Here, no difference was observed in <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> seed germination (Fig. S2). In addition, we measured the width, length, area, and density of stomata, as well as the stomatal conductance of fully expanded leaves under normal conditions, and no evident difference was identified (data not shown), showing that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> might not participate in regulation of stomatal development, aperture, and response to exogenous ABA.</p>
      <p>It was reported that SnRK1s may have roles in regulating energy metabolism, similar to the roles of yeast SNF1 kinase and mammalian AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halford and Hey, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> reported that the absence of barley SnRK1 expression led to abnormal development of pollen and lack of starch accumulation. One embryo-expressed SnRK1 of wheat was involved in regulation of &#x3B1;-amylase in starch accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laurie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Maria Felix <italic>et al.</italic> (2009) demonstrated that silencing of SnRK1s led to increased sucrose levels in transgenic sugar cane. However, there are few reports on SnRK2 function in carbohydrate metabolism. In the present study, we clearly showed that overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> led to significantly decreased total soluble sugar content in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> might be involved in the metabolism of carbohydrate, similar to SnRK1 members. In future research, it will be necessary to gain an understanding of the signals and molecular roles of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> in carbohydrate metabolism.</p>
      <p>Environmental stresses often cause physiological changes in plants. Physiological indices, including OP, CMS, and WRA, are typical physiological parameters for evaluating abiotic stress tolerance and resistance in crop plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dhanda and Sethi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farooq and Azam, 2006</xref>). In general, plants with lower OP and higher CMS and WRA have enhanced tolerance or resistance to environmental stresses. Under hyperosmotic stress, enhanced osmolytes leading to lower OP in plant cells was suggested as an adaptive mechanism for maintenance of turgor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu, 2002</xref>). In our work, the OP of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> seedlings were significantly lower than those of WT and GFP plants under normal growing conditions, but <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants retained higher and steady OP levels compared with the two controls under salt-stress conditions, hinting that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> might be involved in the regulation of OP in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9C</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is well documented that proline is the most widely distributed multifunctional osmolyte occurring in many organisms and playing important roles in enhancing osmotic stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Claussen, 2005</xref>). An increase in free proline was not detected in <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants under normal and stress conditions, suggesting that proline might not be the reason for osmolyte augmentation. Soluble sugar is an important resource of osmolytes. Our data showed that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants had significantly lower total soluble sugar content than controls under well-watered conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), but this was inconsistent with OP determination results, hinting that total soluble sugar content was also not the cause of osmolyte augmentation either. Ongoing research is attempting to dissect the actual molecular mechanisms of decreased OP in <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence is a reliable, non-invasive method for monitoring photosynthetic events and reflects the physiological status of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strasser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence is an important parameter used to assess the physiological status of the photosynthetic apparatus; it represents the maximum quantum yield of the primary photochemical reaction of PS II. Environmental stresses that affect PS II efficiency are known to provoke decreases in <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krause and Weis, 1991</xref>). In this research, the <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> ratios of WT and GFP plants fell much more quickly than <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants had more robust photosynthetic capabilities than the controls.</p>
      <p>Stress tolerance analysis of transgenic <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> and control seedlings planted on MS medium and in soil demonstrated that the transgenic plants had acquired strengthened tolerance to severe drought, salt, and cold stress. Our understanding is that enhanced multi-stress tolerance is possibly due to decreased OP and enhanced root growth. An improved root system of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> plants might absorb water more effectively than WT controls under water-deficit conditions. Decreased OP means more osmolytes in plant sap, which possibly facilitates water retention, maintaining regular cell turgor, and avoiding damage to cell membranes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. Under salt stress, lower OP probably prevents entry of harmful ions, e.g. Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and reduces cell water loss, thereby helping to retain a steady OP under salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9C</xref>), thus relieving ion damage to cell membranes, maintaining cell turgor, and therefore increasing salt tolerance. Under cold stress, lower OP generally means more solutes in the plant sap, resulting in lower freezing points and hence reduced cold damage. In agreement with the expression patterns, no morphological difference was identified between <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> lines and controls after ABA treatment, indicating that <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> does not participate in the response to ABA.</p>
      <p>This study primarily concerned the morphological and physiological features of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under normal and adverse conditions. It was proposed that overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.7</italic> leads to enhanced plant tolerance to stresses mainly through increased osmolytes, enhanced photosynthetic capability, and strengthened seedling roots.</p>
