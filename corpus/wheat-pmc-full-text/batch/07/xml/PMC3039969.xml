        <p>Total RNA from wheat spikes infected with <italic>F. graminearum</italic> Fg2 was extracted and the mRNA was purified. Switching Mechanism at 5&#x2032; end of the RNA Transcript (SMART) technique and CDS Ill/3&#x2032; primer were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase by RT-PCR. Primer extension polymerase chain reaction was used to construct the double-strand cDNA that was digested by proteinase K, then by <italic>Sfi</italic> I and fractionated. cDNAs longer than 0.5 kb were collected and ligated to &#x3BB;TriplEx2 vector followed &#x3BB; phage packaging reaction and library amplification. The qualities of both unamplified and amplified cDNA libraries were strictly checked by conventional titer determination. One hundred and sixty five plaques were randomly picked and tested using PCR with universal primers derived from the sequence flanking the vector. A high quality cDNA library from wheat spikes that have been infected by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was successfully constructed.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, has posed a serious threat to wheat production worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-12-00613">1</xref>]. The disease not only lowers grain yield but reduces grain quality as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-12-00613">1</xref>]. Breeding wheat resistant to FHB is one of the best options to minimize crop and grain quality losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-12-00613">1</xref>]. Consequently, the absence of visible host responses or disease symptoms at the early stages following infection has stimulated investigations of the underlying nature of pathogen-host interactions at the molecular level. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions is of primary importance in devising strategies to control diseases. For this purpose, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis is a method of choice. One of the most powerful techniques for such analysis is suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), and a cDNA library is an essential tool that helps SSH screen the full-length of DEGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-12-00613">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Expression of genes is essential for normal development and pathological processes. Therefore, discovery of DEGs is critical for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in normal and pathological states, as well as providing new insights for discovery of novel genes. Thus, a cDNA library is crucial to pick up the full-length of the genes of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-12-00613">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Constructing a cDNA library lays basic foundation for finding relevant genes and investigating their functions. Unlike genomic DNA that has introns in it, cDNA contains an open reading frame ready for expression. Therefore, a cDNA library can be used not only to screen the target genes required, but also to express them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-12-00613">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>A cDNA library can be constructed from <italic>Fusarium</italic>-infected wheat and used to find the relevant genes and interesting proteins associated with the defense mechanism in plant. For example, single strand cDNAs reverse transcribed from mRNA extracted from wheat spikes inoculated with Fg2 can be used to hybridize with excessive cDNAs from healthy wheat plant (control). Then the remainder of the cDNAs (DEGs under the pathogen) can be used as subtracted cDNA probes for screening a cDNA library constructed from <italic>Fusarium</italic>-infected wheat to search for the homologous clones. Using this method, the full-length genes that are exclusively expressed under Fg2, which induces 3 acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON), could be obtained.</p>
      <p>The sequencing and characterization of cDNA, which represents a direct link to functional genomics, is a powerful means of identifying genetic polymorphisms and is essential for the determination of different gene expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-12-00613">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-12-00613">6</xref>]. In addition, the construction of a cDNA library and the improvement of gene cloning methods will help the identification and cloning of the expressed genes under specific conditions. This will further elucidate the molecular mechanism of the plant-pathogen interaction, since the full-length cDNAs of wheat infected with <italic>F. graminearum</italic> Fg2- 3ADON deposited in the public database are limited.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the study of full-length cDNAs remains an indispensable approach for structural and functional genome annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-12-00613">7</xref>]. Obtaining whole length and an intact cDNA library is often a challenging process. The major challenge every full-length cDNA method tries to resolve is grafting a known sequence at the cap site, so as to be able to prime second-strand polymerization of the cDNA. In some methods, cap-dependent tagging is used as a way of selecting for full-length cDNAs while in others the tag is added on cDNAs previously enriched for molecules extending to the 5&#x2032;cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-12-00613">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-12-00613">9</xref>]. A number of enzymatic or chemical tagging have been described, either on single-strand cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-12-00613">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-12-00613">11</xref>], double-strand cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-12-00613">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-12-00613">13</xref>], de-capped mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-12-00613">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-12-00613">16</xref>] or straight on the mRNA cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-12-00613">17</xref>]. In the strategy followed by Sekine and Kato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-12-00613">15</xref>] and of Maruyama and Sugano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-12-00613">16</xref>], RNAs were dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase, decapped by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase and ligated to an oligonucleotide by T4 RNA ligase.</p>
      <p>In this study, a cDNA library was constructed using Clontech&#x2019;s patented SMART (Switching Mechanism At 5&#x2032; end of RNA) cDNA technology from wheat inoculated with 3ADON-producing <italic>F. graminearum</italic> Fg2.</p>

        <title>2.1. Analysis of Total RNA</title>
        <p>In this study, the ratio of the A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> for total RNAs were 1.95&#x2013;2.1, and the average concentration was 750 ng/&#x3BC;L according to the absorbance of ultraviolet light at 260 nm. Total RNAs of post-inoculation spikes were examined by electrophoresis on 1.1% agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-12-00613">Figure 1</xref>) showing two bright bands; 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA where the former was equal to or more abundant than the latter indicating that little or no RNA degradation or contamination occurred during isolation. Therefore, the total RNA isolated from the <italic>Fusarium</italic>-infected spikes was pure, integrated and stable for cDNA library construction.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>2.2. Analysis of mRNA</title>
        <p>In this study, the 1.1% agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-12-00613">Figure 2</xref>) showed a distributed smear from 0.4&#x2013;4 kb. Therefore, a conclusion could be drawn that the total RNA obtained from <italic>Fusarium</italic> infected spikes was of high quality and quantity. The quantity and quality of cDNA is a key to construct high quality cDNA library, but the quality of cDNA is affected by mRNA. In this study, the total RNA was isolated by RNAase kit (Qiagen), and in comparison, this method was found to be more efficacious than other methods to extract RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-12-00613">18</xref>]. The quantity and integrity of total RNA and mRNA detected by ultraviolet spectrometer and by electrophoresing on an agarose gel was good. Low abundance mRNA (&lt;14 copy/cell) exists in about 30% of all mRNA. According to Clareke-Carbon&#x2019;s formula, a cDNA library should contain at least 1.7 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> independent clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-12-00613">4</xref>], so that a clone derived from low abundance mRNA would be screened out with 99% probability from the library. The capacity of the cDNA library constructed in this study was 5.5 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/mL, which could meet almost all requirements of finding a cDNA clone derived from low abundance mRNA. Furthermore, the recombination efficiency of unamplified and amplified libraries was well over 90%. The unamplified library had no less than 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup> clones which, in principle, was sufficient for including the most mRNA of rarely expressed.</p>

        <title>2.3. Analysis of Primer Extension Product</title>
        <p>Using 1 &#x3BC;g high quality Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized according to the protocol of SMART&#x2122; cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech, USA). Then, whole volume of the ss cDNA (11 &#x3BC;L) was used to synthesize the ds cDNAs. After 3 cycles, 5 &#x3BC;L of 100 &#x3BC;L was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-12-00613">Figure 3</xref>). The bands of double-stranded cDNAs were dispersed and the length was mainly ranging between 0.2&#x2013;3 kb.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>2.4. Analysis of Size-Fractionated cDNA</title>
        <p>cDNA-fragments smaller than 500 bp and longer than 3000 bp were eliminated by cDNA fractionation using a CHROMA SPIN-400 column to avoid the library having a preponderance of very small inserts and/or non-recombinant clones.</p>
        <p>To check the profile of the collected fractions, fifteen fractions were electrophorised on 1.1% agarose gel and the desired size fractions were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-12-00613">Figure 4</xref>), pooled, precipitated and then resuspended in 7 &#x3BC;L water to be ready for ligation step.</p>
        <p>The early work of Maniatis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-12-00613">19</xref>] provided a foundation for the use of cDNA libraries in molecular and genomic research. Since that time, the construction of cDNA libraries has become one of the most fundamental tools in genomics research. Once constructed, cDNA libraries can be used to identify genes of interest as well as serving as a physical resource for full length clones. Although there are tremendous benefits for the successful generation of a cDNA library, historically the process of cDNA library generation has been inconsistent and laborious. A high percent of 5&#x2032;-truncated clones may be generated from traditional methods and protocols involving full-length mRNA are labor intensive and susceptible to degradation from RNase. In the current study, with SMART, we could enrich full-length double-stranded cDNAs, generate high-quality cDNA from nanograms of total RNA, and use cDNA for library construction.</p>

          <p>The titer of the unamplified library corresponding to the concentration ratio of cDNA and &#x3BB; phage vector (1/10) was 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mL. The recombination clones were analyzed by X-gal, and there were 80 blue plaques and 920 colorless plaques in one plate giving a recombination efficiency of 92% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-12-00613">Figure 5A,B</xref>).</p>

          <p>The 1:10 diluted packaged lysate was amplified to yield 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> plaques per 150 mm-plate. Twenty 150 mm-plates were plated counting 2 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> independent clones, yet, in most cases, 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> is representative of the mRNA complexity. The titer of the amplified library was 5.5 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/mL, and the percentage of the recombinants according to the blue and white screening was 94% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-12-00613">Figure 5C,D</xref>). These results are in agreement with constructing a library.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>2.6. Identification of the cDNA Inserts of the Recombinants</title>
        <p>One hundred sixty five plaques were randomly picked and amplified by PCR using the universal primers mentioned earlier. The sizes of PCR products were between 1&#x2013;2 kb for 110 samples (66.67%), 0.5&#x2013;1.0 kb for 55 samples (33.33%) and the majority inserts were well over 0.5 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-12-00613">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>The technology used in this study for full-length cDNA enrichment is robust and only requires less than 1 &#x3BC;g of starting total RNA. By using the MMLV reverse transcriptase, only the 5&#x2032;-end tagged cDNAs are not prematurely terminated and can be amplified into full-length by an RNA oligo-specific primer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-12-00613">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-12-00613">21</xref>]. The size fractionation process was applied to remove small-molecular weight such as primers, DNA, and dNTPs. The enrichment of the full-length cDNA was achieved by PCR amplification following the cDNA synthesis. Because selection bias could favor the smaller cDNA, fewer PCR cycles were used to minimize such bias as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-12-00613">20</xref>]. The conventionally constructed cDNA libraries rarely carry cDNA inserts over 2 kb, because the longer transcripts are often easily truncated during cDNA synthesis process, causing size bias against the larger cDNA fragments in cloning process. In this study, cDNA synthesis by primer extension was used as it is ideal protocol for researches who are not limited by their starting material.</p>
        <p>FHB disease can cause animal feed refusal/sickness and illness in humans by producing mycotoxins that consist of nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3ADON, and 15 deoxynivalenol (15ADON). Isolates of 3ADON chemotype have been found to produce significantly higher levels of DON than those with a 15ADON chemotype. Therefore, based on the constructed cDNA library, we will be able to have a full length of DEGs and investigate the transcriptome pattern between 3ADON and 15ADON-infected wheat plants using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (This research is ongoing).</p>

        <title>3.3. Extraction of Total RNA</title>
        <p>Isolation of high quality total RNA and purification of mRNA are critical steps for constructing a cDNA library. Total RNA was extracted from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia suspension-inoculated spikes. Prior to the extraction of RNA, for each sampling time, three spikes from three different plants were pooled together to reduce the level of biological variation between the samples. Frozen spikes were ground using sterile pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen into a fine powder. Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of powder in Eppendorf tube using the silica membrane spin column provided with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Maryland, USA) and subsequently treated with DNase I from RNase-Free DNase Kit (Qiagen, Maryland, USA) to remove genomic DNA, according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Based on the different time of sampling, we obtained seven total RNA samples. The integrity of the total RNA was analyzed using 1.1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The concentration and purity of the total RNA were determined by spectrophotometry (Ultrospec 3100 pro, biochrom, Cambridge, England) at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths.</p>

After 10 mL of melted LB/MgSO<sub>4</sub> top soft agar was added into each tube (20 tubes of 15 mL volume), the mixture was poured onto 150 mm LB/MgSO<sub>4</sub> agar plates pre-warmed to 37 &#xB0;C. The 20-plates were inverted after being cooled and incubated at 37 &#xB0;C overnight. Eight mL of lx lambda dilution buffer was added to each plate. The plates were stored at 4 &#xB0;C overnight to allow the phage diffuse into the buffer, and then incubated on a platform shaker at 50 rpm at room temperature for 6 h. The phage lysates were pooled into a sterile beaker, and extra 2 mL of buffer was added into each plate to dislodge remaining phage from the agar. Five percent final concentration of chloroform was added into the pooled lysate and then poured into a sterile 50 mL polypropylene screw-cap microcentrifuge tube, vortexed for 2 min, and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred into another sterilized 50 mL centrifuge tube, and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added (final concentration 7%). The amplified library was put into 1.5 mL sterilized microcentrifuge tubes and stored at &#x2212;80 &#xB0;C.</p>
