      <abstract>
        <p>In bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum L</italic>.), the simultaneous improvement of both yield and grain protein is difficult because of the strong negative relationship between these two traits. However, some genotypes deviate positively from this relationship and this has been linked to their ability to take up nitrogen (N) during the post-flowering period, regardless of their N status at flowering. The physiological and genetic determinants of post-flowering N uptake relating to N satiety are poorly understood. This study uses semi-hydroponic culture of <italic>cv</italic>. R&#xE9;cital under controlled conditions to explore these controls. The first objective was to record the effects of contrasting N status at flowering on post-flowering nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) uptake under non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions, while following the expression of key genes involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and assimilation. We found that post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake was strongly influenced by plant N status at flowering during the first 300&#x2013;400 degree-days after flowering, overlapping with a probable regulation of nitrate uptake exerted by N demand for growth. The uptake of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> correlated well with the expression of the gene <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, coding for a root NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter, which seems to play a major role in post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake. These results provide a useful knowledge base for future investigation of genetic variability in post-flowering N uptake and may lead to concomitant gains in both grain yield and grain protein in wheat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Although grain yield (GY) remains the main breeding priority for wheat breeders, grain protein concentration (GPC) is another important priority, as GPC is a key element of wheat end-use value [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and thus determines both the price paid to the farmer per tonne and also the opportunity for achieving export quality. However, the strongly negative relationship between GY and GPC [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] complicates the simultaneous improvement in these two traits, as increases in GY are generally detrimental to GPC. A classic agronomic strategy for obtaining high GY with adequate GPC in high-input agriculture is based on growing genotypes having strong yield potential, coupled with fertilisation practices that favour high GPC. In particular, delaying the last nitrogen (N) fertiliser application at heading, allows the low GPC, potentially associated with high GY, to be increased to an acceptable level. However, this approach is increasingly being questioned in a world where there is increasing pressure to reduce N inputs, both because of its rising cost and also because of a rising awareness of the environmental damage resulting from excessive N use in agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Monaghan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] proposed an alternative strategy for improving GPC without decreasing GY, thus breaking the negative GY-GPC relationship. This strategy originates from the observation that some genotypes exhibit robust deviations (whether positive or negative) from the regression of GPC on GY. This deviation, grain protein deviation (GPD), has a strong genetic basis [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and has interesting potential as a breeding criterion. Based on this proposition, some studies have focused on identifying the physiological basis of genetic variability in GPD. In particular, Bogard <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that GPD was highly correlated with post-flowering N uptake regardless of plant N status at flowering. This led to the hypothesis that GPD could be conditioned by a putative genetic variability in the control of N satiety, that would allow some varieties to absorb more N after flowering. Testing of such a hypothesis demands a better understanding of post-flowering N uptake in wheat and its regulation by plant N status.</p>
      <p>Grain N originates from two distinct sources: remobilisation from vegetative organs of N assimilated pre-flowering, and post-flowering uptake of N from the soil. The relative contributions to grain N of these two sources are negatively correlated [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and are strongly dependent on environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Typically, for wheat under field conditions, post-flowering N uptake contributes between 5 and 40% to total grain N [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The fraction depends also on growing context and, to a lesser extent, on genotype. A number of experiments have been carried out on wheat and barley under controlled conditions to study N uptake, including during the post-flowering period. These offer interesting understandings, such as of effects of N availability on the dynamics of biomass accumulation and N concentration [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], of N uptake dynamics under N-limiting conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], of root N uptake capacity during the post-flowering period [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and of the fate of the N taken up post-flowering [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, little is known of the kinetics of post-flowering N uptake, or of the associated control mechanisms. New information is needed at both the whole plant scale and at the molecular scale. In the latter case, the conservation of the metabolic pathways associated with both N uptake and N assimilation in higher plants, offers useful tools for studying post-flowering N uptake at the molecular scale.</p>
      <p>Several recent reviews provide an extensive view of known mechanisms of N uptake and assimilation [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Uptake of N appears to be regulated mainly by plant demand [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, a major area of continuing discussion among authors centres on the nature of the signal for N satiety. This has been proposed to be: (a) NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or (b) circulating amino-acids such as glutamine [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The principal forms in which N is taken up from the soil by plants are as nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and as ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> being preferred under aerobic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In higher plants, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake involves two distinct systems classified according to their affinities for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. The low-affinity transport system (LATS) is predominant when N concentrations ([N]) in the medium are high, with a K<sub>m</sub> constant in the mM range. The high-affinity transport system (HATS) operates under low [N] conditions, with a K<sub>m</sub> in the &#x3BC;M range [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>LATS is coded by the NRT1 gene family which has 53 known members in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> while HATS is coded by the NRT2 gene family which has seven members in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. Among the LATS family, <italic>AtNRT1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> (<italic>CHL1</italic>) is the most studied, and both it and <italic>AtNRT1</italic>.<italic>2</italic> are expressed in the root epidermis and participate in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Meanwhile, <italic>AtNRT1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is a dual-affinity transporter being both constitutive and inducible, and it is involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake under both high- and low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, it has recently been shown that <italic>AtNRT1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> can transport both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and/or auxin depending on the external concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In rice, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>OsNRT1</italic> is the homolog of <italic>AtNRT1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and has been cloned and characterised as a low-affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter which is expressed constitutively in the root epidermis [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Based on sequence homology approaches, a number of other putative NRT1 family members (homologous to the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> NRT1 family) have been found in a range of species including: <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although homologues of most members of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> NRT1 gene family probably exist in wheat, to our knowledge, only one has been studied [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>The two main genes expressed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> roots coding for HATS are <italic>AtNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>AtNRT2</italic>.<italic>2</italic>. Of these, AtNRT2.1, in interaction with an AtNAR2 protein [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] accounts for about 75% of the high-affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These genes are induced by low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration ([NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]) and repressed by high [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] and so belong to the group of inducible HATS. The HATS NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake system is also implicated in plant responses to N starvation. Expression of <italic>AtNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> increases rapidly when NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is supplied to N-starved plants but later decreases if the provision of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is maintained [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Putative homologues of the main HATS coding genes in maize are <italic>ZmNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>ZmNRT2</italic>.<italic>2</italic>. These were detected by the sequence homology approach [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and were later studied under hydroponic conditions where they seem to play a key role in N uptake even at [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] higher than 1 mM [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The orthologue of <italic>AtNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> in wheat is <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, and this has been characterised and its expression profiles suggest that it too belongs to the inducible HATS [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To our knowledge, <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is the only member of the <italic>NRT2</italic> gene family currently characterized in wheat.</p>
      <p>Following its uptake, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is reduced to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) by nitrate reductase (NR) and the NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> is subsequently reduced to ammonium by nitrite reductase (NiR) [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A loop between glutamine synthetase 2 (GS2) and the two forms of glutamine 2-oxoglutarate amino transferase (GOGAT), NADH-GOGAT and Fd-GOGAT, finally integrate the N into amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Genes involved in N reduction and assimilation have been investigated in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
      <p>The objective of our study was to provide a clearer view of post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake dynamics in wheat in relation to the N status at flowering. To study the uptake of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in detail, a semi-hydroponic approach under controlled conditions was established because of its susceptibility to environmental factors. Wheat plants (cv. R&#xE9;cital) were grown under four pre-flowering conditions with contrasting levels of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]. At flowering, all conditions were altered to be NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> non-limiting, allowing plants to fully exploit their NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake potentials. The use of <sup>15</sup>N pulse labelling allowed detailed recording of the dynamics of post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and relative quantification of the expression of the main genes involved in both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and assimilation and enabled links to be observed between gene expression and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake.</p>

        <p>Selected wheat grains (55 to 60 mg) of cv. R&#xE9;cital were sown in germination trays filled with compost and placed in a heated greenhouse at 20&#xB0;C for 14 days. After emergence, plants were vernalised for six weeks in a plant growth chamber (6&#xB0;C, 8 h photoperiod, light intensity 350 &#x3BC;mol PAR m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). After vernalisation, the roots were washed free of compost and plants were transplanted into PVC tubes (7 cm diam, 60 cm high) filled with a perlite:sand mixture (1:1, v:v) for semi-hydroponic culture. The lower end of each tube was closed with a perforated cap to contain the substrate while allowing excess nutrient solution to drain. Two plants were transplanted into each tube and tubes were placed vertically in eight containers (64 tubes per container, container area 0.49 m<sup>2</sup>). The resulting planting density (260 plants m<sup>-2</sup>) is comparable to that in the field under local agronomic practices.</p>
        <p>Containers were placed in a growth chamber under a long-day photoperiod (16 h light at 20&#xB0;C, 8 h dark at 18&#xB0;C). Light intensity was 650 &#x3BC;mol PAR m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Air temperature, humidity and light intensity at canopy level were recorded every 15 min using a CR1000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA). Each tube was fitted with an automated micro-irrigation system, receiving one of four different nutrient solutions containing 1, 4, 7 or 10 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (the four nutrient treatments are referred to as N1, N4, N7 or N10, respectively). The nutrient solution compositions were adapted from Castle and Randall [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Two of the eight containers were irrigated with each of the nutrient solutions, with each tube receiving 66 ml of nutrient solution every three hours.</p>
        <p>The flowering date (Zadok&#x2019;s GS65) of each main stem was recorded. From flowering to maturity, all containers were irrigated with 66 ml every three hours of the same nutrient solution containing 10 mM of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Before each sampling, a subset of plants from each treatment (8 tubes per NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pre-flowering condition) were submitted to 24 h of pulse labelling with <sup>15</sup>N by watering with 66 ml every three hours of a 10 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> nutrient solution enriched in <sup>15</sup>N by 10%.</p>

        <title>Sampling protocol</title>
        <p>Eight sampling dates were chosen during the post-flowering period. The first destructive sampling took place one day after flowering (GS65) and the remainder at approximately GS65+ 125, 250, 400, 500, 600, 800 and 1200 degree-days (DD) base 0&#xB0;C. Each sampling was made at the same time of day (1&#x2013;2 h after the start of the light period). On each sampling date, 16 tubes (32 plants) from each of the four NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments were collected. Of these, four were used for physiological measurements and analysis of total nitrogen, four for gene expression and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> analysis and the remaining eight for <sup>15</sup>N analysis. Each tube (two plants) was considered a biological replicate.</p>

        <p>Physiological analyses were performed on four biological replicates. The processing of the two plants from each tube consisted first of counting the number of tillers and spikes per tube. The plants were then separated into six fractions; grains, chaff, stems (including leaf sheaths), green laminae, dry laminae, and roots. At stage GS65, in the absence of developed grains, ears were not separated into grain and chaff. All samples were oven dried to constant weight for 48 h at 80&#xB0;C before dry weight (DW) measurement. Dry samples were ground to a fine powder using a ball mill and total nitrogen concentration was measured with the Dumas combustion method using a Flash EA 1112 Series CNS analyser (ThermoFisher Scientific, Illkirch, France).</p>

        <title>Effects of pre-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments on plant morphology, biomass and N concentration</title>
        <p>Four levels of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the nutrient solutions were used until flowering (1, 4, 7 and 10 mM, respectively referred to as N1, N4 N7 and N10). These led to highly contrasting tiller numbers, biomasses and N concentrations at flowering (<xref rid="pone.0120291.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Tiller number increased significantly with rising [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]. Values lay between 522 tillers m<sup>-2</sup> for N1, and 1371 tillers m<sup>-2</sup> for N10, indicating a strong morphological response to rising N. Tiller number increased linearly with [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p = 0.005; data not shown), with an average slope of 92.5 tillers m<sup>-2</sup> per mM of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]. Plant biomass ranged from 393 gDW m<sup>-2</sup> for N1 to 1702 gDW m<sup>-2</sup> for N10. Even though the biomass difference between plants at flowering from N4 to N7 was not significantly different (p = 0.168), a linear regression across the four [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatments vs plant biomass did reveal a significant relationship (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.95, p = 0.026; data not shown). This trend shows that all treatments lay within a range where [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] was limiting for plant growth. Plant N concentration (plant [N]) at flowering increased strongly and linearly with nutrient [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p = 0.003; data not shown). The average slope was 0.183 percentage points of plant [N] per mM of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the two groups of treatments described for plant [N] stood out for the agronomic variables of grain yield, grain N concentration (grain [N]) and total grain N. There were no significant differences in grain yield either between N1 and N4 (690, 1051 g m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively) or between N7 and N10 (1828 and 1944 g m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively). Probably due to the semi-hydroponic growth conditions, grain yields were high (equivalent to 69 and 194 q ha<sup>-1</sup> for the two extreme treatments). Grain [N] values were 3.1 and 2.9%DW for N1 and N4, respectively and 2.5%DW for N7 and N10, respectively. There were strong and highly significant opposite-going effects of pre-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment on grain yield and grain [N]. Grain yield and grain [N] were therefore negatively correlated (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p = 0.002). Total grain N (<xref rid="pone.0120291.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) was lower than total post-flowering N uptake (calculated by difference between total plant N at maturity, <xref rid="pone.0120291.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and total plant N at flowering, <xref rid="pone.0120291.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), indicating that there was no net remobilisation of N from vegetative parts to the grains under our semi-hydroponic conditions. Harvest index lay between 0.39 and 0.44, which is close to values commonly observed under field conditions.</p>
        <p>Starting from significantly different levels of plant [N] at flowering, plants from the four [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatments quickly converged showing comparable [N] by GS65+300DD (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Convergence occurred between flowering and GS65+300DD, and led to plant [N] values between approximately 2.1 and 2.5%DW for all treatments. Interestingly, the convergence between treatments was reflected not only in an increase in plant [N] in the low-N pre-flowering treatments (N1 and N4) but also in a decrease in the high-N pre-flowering treatments (N7 and N10). During this phase, plants from N1 and N4 exhibited [N] increases of 59 and 20%, respectively, while plants from N7 and N10 exhibited [N] decreases of 13 and 18%, respectively. From GS65+300DD until maturity, plant [N] remained relatively stable for all treatments, varying between 2.0 and 2.7%DW.</p>

        <title>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake during the post-flowering period</title>
        <p>The <sup>15</sup>N pulse labelling allows precise measurement of the dynamics of plant NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake during the post-flowering period. <xref rid="pone.0120291.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> shows that all treatments had strong NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptakes at flowering, with levels between 0.36 and 1.08 gNO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> m<sup>-2</sup>day<sup>-1</sup> depending on [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatment. After flowering and regardless of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatment, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake showed a rapid decrease from flowering until a date between GS65+300DD and GS65+400DD where uptake stopped. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake then recovered rapidly to a substantial level between 0.2 and 0.5 gNO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> m<sup>-2</sup>day<sup>-1</sup> depending on [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatment and then slowly declined until maturity. In addition to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake dynamics, these results also show that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake continued until late during the post-flowering period when plants were exposed to a non-limiting level of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the nutrient solution.</p>

        <p>When NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is normalised to plant DW, it is easier to interpret differences in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake between the four [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatments (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Although in terms of temporal dynamics, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake looks very similar either in absolute terms (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) or when normalised by DW (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), the latter representation shows that plants from N1 had strong NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptakes per unit DW (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As expected, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake was strongly impacted by plant N status at flowering. Also at flowering, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake per unit DW was considerably larger for plant exposed to the low [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatments pre-flowering. Relative to N10, daily fluxes of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake were 5.7-, 5- and 2.4-times higher for N1, N4 and N7, respectively. Furthermore, the normalisation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake per unit DW allows better comparisons of the different periods of the temporal dynamic. Indeed, the direct effect of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake on plant [N] was much stronger at flowering than later during the post-flowering period (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Lastly, the exact stage of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake recovery seems to differ between the [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] treatments. The most obvious trend is that plants exposed to higher pre-flowering [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], restarted uptake earlier than those exposed to lower pre-flowering [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>].</p>

        <title>Post-flowering dynamics of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter gene expression in roots</title>
        <p>The gene expression and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration measurements were carried out only on N4 and N10 plants because these represent a best compromise between a distinct N effect and non-extreme plant structures. Because of the strong correlation observed between roots and stems [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] dynamic during the post-flowering period (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.695, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), and because flag leaves were not impacted by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>), the results presented in this section are based on root samples only. This specific focus on roots for [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] was chosen to improve results clarity, given that roots and stems bring redundant information, and flag leaves seemingly bring no information on the differences on plant N status observed in the present study. Results from stems and flag leaves are however available as supplementary data (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Levels of root [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] at flowering were strongly impacted by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Indeed, at flowering, N4 plants exhibited root [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] of 29.1 &#x3BC;mol gFW<sup>-1</sup> whereas in N10 plants [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] was 2.6-times higher (77.8 &#x3BC;mol gFW<sup>-1</sup>). After flowering, the two treatments rapidly converged to around 80 &#x3BC;mol gFW<sup>-1</sup> after about 300DD. Despite some variability between sampling dates, [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] remained relatively stable thereafter. The rapid convergence of root [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] between the two treatments was caused mainly by a near doubling of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] in N4 during the 200 DD immediately following flowering (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The levels of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] in the roots were not significantly related to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake (data not shown).</p>

        <p>To provide a biologically coherent description, correlations between the expressions patterns of the major genes involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, the reduction and assimilation networks were examined pairwise according to the path of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation. Root samples from N4 and N10 were observed independently. In the same way as for [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], results presented for gene expression are based solely on root samples.

        <p>There was a significant positive correlation between the expression patterns of the high-affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter family member <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and the nitrate reductase <italic>TaNR</italic> in both N4 and in N10 in roots (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The lower r<sup>2</sup> observed for N10 is explained mainly by the three outliers.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The objectives of this study were to provide a detailed vision of post-flowering N uptake and to identify possible control mechanisms, using a prospective approach based on correlations between physiological traits, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and expression level of key genes of the N metabolism. Clearly, the present work does not provide any functional dissection of the interaction between these physiological processes but highlights strong correlations between variables during post-flowering N uptake on wheat plants in realistic conditions in term of plant size, canopy structure and grain sink strength.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, wheat plants were grown under four pre-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments to create contrasting N statuses at flowering and monitor post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake under non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions. Results show that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake occurred until late grain filling. N status influenced NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake rates at flowering and all treatments converged rapidly towards comparable levels of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake. Treatment differences in [N] at flowering decreased considerably under non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake rate was correlated with <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression, which in turn was correlated with <italic>TaNR</italic> expression. The main components of the gene network involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction and N assimilation showed coordinated patterns of expression. Root [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] levels were negatively correlated with <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, indicating that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> could be a regulating element for <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression and, so also of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake. Here, we will discuss: (i) the experimental conditions; (ii) the control of post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake; (iii) the putative impact of <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> on NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and its putative regulation; and (iv) possible limiting factors for grain [N] under extreme conditions of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of growing conditions</title>
        <p>Growing wheat in controlled hydroponic conditions allows nutrient availability to be closely regulated. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain nutrient availabilities fully comparable with those under field conditions. Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] have developed fertilisation protocols for use in hydroponic culture that allow field N conditions to be mimicked with constant availability of growth-limiting levels of N. Here, a more classical approach was used to drive growth during the pre-flowering period. This involved four distinct NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments and generated canopies of markedly contrasting structure. The level of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] in the nutrient solutions strongly influenced pre-flowering plant development, with increments of [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] increasing tiller density linearly by about 90 tillers m<sup>-2</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup>, biomass by about 140g m<sup>-2</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup> and [N] by 0.2 percentage points mM<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
        <p>A further objective of the experimental setup was to apply NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> at excess levels during the post-flowering period in order to study the effects of N status at flowering on NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake under non-limiting conditions. Although 10 mM [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] in a nutrient solution is usually considered to be non-limiting for growth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and is usually the highest level N treatment in hydroponic wheat [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], it is difficult to be certain that this level was strictly non-limiting as we did not include treatments with even higher levels of [N]. Barneix [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] stated in a review that high N uptake rates, lead to high levels of N nutrition, but they inhibit leaf senescence and the remobilisation of N to the grain. In our study, the absence of significant net remobilisation of N from vegetative parts during the post-flowering period (the amount of N taken up was higher than the total in the grain for all treatments) suggests that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was indeed available in a sufficient quantity. This scenario differs from the 60 to 95% of N remobilisation usually observed in the field [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
        <p>Therefore, it seems reasonable to infer that the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments used here led not only to highly contrasting stands at flowering but they further allowed the post-flowering growth to be non-limiting with regard to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.</p>

        <title>Post-flowering control of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake</title>
        <p>Under our semi-hydroponic, non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions, plants exhibited positive NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake until late in grain filling. Similar observations have been reported for barley cultured hydroponically under N-limiting conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and for wheat [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as well as for wheat under semi-controlled conditions, more similar to the field [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In these studies, N uptake also occurred until close to grain maturity, showing that these plants do not have an intrinsic physiological incapacity to take up N during grain filling. Compared to the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake rates in the present study, the lower rates generally observed in the field are thus unlikely related to an intrinsic incapacity of the plant but instead to some unfavourable conditions that affect either the availability of N in the soil or the plant&#x2019;s demand for it.</p>
        <p>In their hydroponic study on wheat, Oscarson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that under N-limiting conditions, N uptake gradually decreases throughout the post-flowering period. However, under non-limiting conditions, we show that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is far from constant from flowering to maturity. This leads to the hypothesis that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is regulated by factors other than NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability. Information on N uptake dynamics in wheat under non-limiting conditions is scarce, particularly during the post-flowering period. Both Imsande and Touraine [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and Feil [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in a review based on both controlled conditions and field experiments hypothesised that N uptake reflects the internal demand of the crop and is not determined only by the external [N]. This idea also finds support in some more recent experimental studies [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] as well as in assessments of N uptake arising from wheat crop simulation models. These models, despite some calculation differences, calculate N uptake as governed by a balance between the plant&#x2019;s needs to support growth and the availability of N in the soil [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Thus, under non-limiting N conditions, N uptake is potentially fully governed by the plant&#x2019;s demand for N for growth.</p>
        <p>If the present study confirms earlier findings on post flowering N uptake in wheat, it also provides a clearer view of the small-scale dynamics of the process. Post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake dynamics can be divided into three distinct phases. The first of these is from flowering to sometime between GS65+300DD and GS65+400DD (depending on treatment). Here NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake declines considerably from its level at flowering. Next, in the second phase, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake almost ceases for a period of about 100DD. And last, in the third phase, a recovery of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake occurs which persists to maturity. Interestingly, each phase coincides with a physiological evolution in development, supporting the idea that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake could be strongly controlled by a growth demand for N.</p>
        <p>The general decline in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake during the first phase is synchronous with a reduction in the sink strength of plant growth. Indeed, immediately after flowering, there are few new sinks for N as the photosynthetic apparatus is already fully developed, whereas the spikes are not yet into a phase of rapid biomass increase. The main biomass increment occurring during this phase is driven by post flowering stem elongation. The stem is a structural tissue that is relatively poor in N compared with, say, a leaf. Both the upper internode and the ear peduncle are known to continue extension for approximately one week after anthesis [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although a common tendency in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake decrease was observed after flowering in the four NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments, there were quite marked differences in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake levels between treatments. Thus, immediately after flowering when NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability became non-limiting, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake ranked inversely with the level of pre-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment. Also, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake rate at flowering and its dynamics during the first phase immediately afterwards, are in line with a convergence towards a common value for [N]. This observation supports the idea that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake could be regulated also by plant N status. The high levels of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake at this time observed in the low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treated plants, was associated with an increase in total plant [N] and this mainly through N enrichment of the existing organs. This phenomenon is a familiar response of plants re-supplied with N after a period of N starvation. Under such conditions increased N uptake rates have been reported in both wheat [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and barley [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the plant [N] convergence between treatments was not due solely to increased plant [N] in the low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments but also to decreased plant [N] in the high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments. This was linked mainly with a greater increase in stem biomass in the high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments than in the low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments (data not shown). The latter was probably because of a higher cover density resulting in more light competition among the plants [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Because stems are poorer in N than leaves, the relative change in proportion between leaf and stem coupled with a low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake rate resulted in a decrease in [N] at the whole plant level.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the observations of Oscarson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake in our study stopped completely for a period of about 100&#xB0;Cdays around GS65+300DD to GS65+400DD. Physiologically, this phenomenon coincided with the absence of a significant sink for N. This is because the vegetative parts of the plant were fully developed, while the reproductive parts (the grains) had not yet started active filling. Furthermore, plant [N] was already extremely high at this stage in all treatments.</p>
        <p>Still in agreement with the hypothesis of the control of N uptake by the N growth demand, the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake resumed when the grains started to fill. If grain storage protein filling starts around GS65+240DD, then its maximal rate occurs from about GS65+300DD to GS65+600DD [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In absence of any net N remobilisation from the vegetative parts, this phase of renewed NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake was the main source of N for grain filling. Using <sup>15</sup>N pulse labelling in a hydroponic study, Oscarson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that where N was limiting, a temporary increase in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability late during grain filling resulted in a preferential allocation of newly-assimilated N to the grain. The authors concluded that <sup>15</sup>N taken up during grain filling was rapidly incorporated in the mobile N pool of the plant and was allocated partly to tissue maintenance but mainly to grain filling. Surprisingly, our different treatments which resulted in highly-contrasting grain yields instead had closely-similar NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake rates during this third phase. This suggests that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake was slowed in the high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments although these, at least potentially, had greater sink demand for N. As NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was in excess, the ability of plants to assimilate N probably reached its limits under such extreme conditions.</p>

        <title>Relationships between plant NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and the expression of N metabolism genes</title>
        <p>The relative expressions of the seven main genes involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and N assimilation were followed for the N4 and N10 treatments. These genes are hypothesised to be representative of N network activity and composed of genes coding NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters, and key enzymes involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction and assimilation. Relative expression dynamics were followed in the roots during the post-flowering period with the double purpose (a) of better understanding their behaviour and interrelationships for plants of different N status under non-limiting conditions, and (b) of observing the relationship between <sup>15</sup>N-based measurements NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and the expression the N network genes. Although the results presented here for genes expression were focused on root samples, the conclusions of the study should not be biased for two main reasons. Firstly, a large part of N reduction and assimilation occurs in roots during grain filling in wheat (60 to 75% depending on N fertilization level) [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Secondly, the high positive correlations observed for all studied genes between roots and flag leaves (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), except <italic>TaNADH-GOGAT</italic>, suggest that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction and assimilation processes could be subjected to a common regulation in these two major organs for N metabolism.</p>
        <p>The significant correlation between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> relative expression in N4 plants during the post-flowering period suggests an important role for this high-affinity nitrate transporter in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake. Nevertheless, the absence of a correlation in N10 plants, suggests that the relation is not linear at constant high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability. Conversely, no correlation between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and <italic>TaNRT1</italic> relative expression could be detected, suggesting a limited role for this gene under our conditions. Moreover, our results show that <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is expressed at higher levels than <italic>TaNRT1</italic> despite the high [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] (10 mM) in the nutrient solution. Comparable results have been found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> grown in 10 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supplied for 5 min with 6 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, where <italic>AtNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> was expressed at higher levels than <italic>AtNRT1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> both in the plant&#x2019;s vegetative and reproductive stages [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, in maize, <italic>ZmNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>ZmNRT2</italic>.<italic>2</italic> were expressed at higher levels than <italic>ZmNRT1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>ZmNRT1</italic>.<italic>2</italic> throughout the life cycle with both 0.5 and 2.5 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and <italic>ZmNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression patterns showed strong similarities to the N uptake dynamic [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In wheat, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] also showed that <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is always expressed at higher levels than <italic>TaNRT1</italic> in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ranges comparable to ours. These results suggest that <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> participates in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake in a substantial way, even at high [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>].</p>
        <p>Corroborating correlations with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> relative expression also correlated with <italic>TaNR</italic> relative expression in roots (<xref rid="pone.0120291.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) as well as in flag leaves (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). The presumed major role of <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> in post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is supported by its consistent expression dynamics with the rest of the network. Conversely, the expression dynamics of <italic>TaNRT1</italic> was not correlated with <italic>TaNR</italic> and, therefore neither with the rest of the network. <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> thus appears to have a major role in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, especially during periods of rapid uptake under non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions. However, the correlation between expression and uptake was not perfect, suggesting that <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is complemented by other NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters operating under a different control mechanism.</p>
        <p>Regulation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters is a key factor for understanding NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the regulation of the NRT2 gene family by internal feedback. According to literature sources, putative inhibitory signals are NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or circulating amino acids such as glutamine [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Under our conditions, <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression was clearly negatively correlated with [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] in roots, suggesting a negative feedback exerted by the root NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> level. According to this hypothesis, during plant growth, N demand exercised by newly-formed N sinks could limit NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulation in roots, thus allowing the maintenance or increase of <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression. Decreases in N sink strength could lead to [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] increases in the roots, resulting in <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> repression, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake decrease. This hypothesis for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake regulation fits with the assumption that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is controlled by plant growth rate under non-limiting conditions.</p>
        <p>Study of the relative expressions of the key N network genes reveals their apparent common regulation during post-flowering period, with strong correlations between the various components. Root [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] would seem to be a good candidate for the role of transmitting the plant N status signal to the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters. Although relative gene expression studies should be complemented by enzymatic activity assays, because additional regulation may occur at the post-transcriptional level, such as for NR [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], cytosolic GS1 [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], or the root ammonium transporter AMT1.1 [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], our results still seem to indicate a major role for TaNRT2.1 transporter in post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake under non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions. Plants have shown the ability to quickly regulate their [N] under non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions when previously NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> starved, coinciding with increases in the relative expressions of key N metabolism genes. It is possible that this approach may allow identification of genetic variability in the ability to quickly assimilate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> when NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is available. A large capacity for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation during short favourable periods during the post-flowering growth phase may be a determinant element for increasing grain [N].</p>

[<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] demonstrated that genetic variability in grain [N] was strongly related to post-flowering N uptake capacity, regardless of plant N status at flowering. Thus, one objective of this work was to open tracks in the understanding of the complex regulations of post-flowering N uptake and N assimilation.</p>
        <p>Here, high levels of grain yield were associated with decreased grain [N]. This observation is classic, since it is the basis of the extremely well known negative relationship between grain yield and grain protein [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It is, however, less intuitive under our conditions of non-limiting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability during grain filling.</p>
        <p>In an ear-halving experiment with four cultivars of contrasting yield potential, Martre <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] showed that grain [N] was mainly source-limited as grain [N] increased in halved ears, and as grain N per ear was nearly constant. More precisely, they stated that if yield is clearly limited by sink size, then their ear-halving experiment suggests that grain N filling is relatively more limited by N source. Following this hypothesis, several potential processes limiting N grain filling can be identified, from root N uptake to protein synthesis within the grain, passing through N assimilation and N transport to ears. Our study suggests that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake can reasonably be dismissed from this series, because of the high post-flowering availability of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In addition the results obtained by Oscarson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] show that intrinsic root N uptake capacity was never a limiting factor under hydroponic conditions. Grain protein synthesis capacity and N transport into the ear can also be eliminated. First, there is no obvious reason for a higher capacity for protein synthesis in grains under a low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment than in those under a high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment, based on the fact that in our study, the grains of the four treatments had comparable individual masses (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Second, using wheat ears grown in liquid culture, Barlow <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] show that ear capacity to transport N compounds and grain capacity to synthesise protein were not limiting elements. This is supported by the conclusions of Martre <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] which state that the capacity of the sink to synthesise proteins does not regulate grain N accumulation. We therefore conclude that, the most likely hypothesis to explain the decrease in grain [N] with increasing yield, is a limitation operating at the level of N assimilation, with a possible saturation of the assimilation pathway.</p>
        <p>In our study, increased grain yield was principally related to higher grain numbers per square meter (<xref rid="pone.0120291.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), and these were mainly conditioned by pre-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability. Grain growth rate has been shown to be independent of N availability [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The independence between grain development and N availability implies that N demand by the grain during the post-flowering period depends mainly on a plant yield potential established before flowering and therefore varies with the availability of N before flowering. Thus, plants from the low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments developed a relatively small yield potential, and filled a low number of grains under later high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions after flowering. Conversely, plants from the high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments developed a relatively high yield potential, and filled a higher number of grains under the later high-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions. In the latter case, this necessarily implies a reduced share of available N per grain, thus leading to lower grain [N].</p>
        <p>Our results do not allow a precise conclusion regarding the main metabolic process(es) responsible for source limitation. Nevertheless, Jenner <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] proposed that a single, or a few, of the amino-acids necessary for grain protein synthesis may limit the global N flux to the grain. For example proline is a major component of storage proteins but represents only a small fraction of the total amino-acid pool in the plant and this can be limiting. In addition, Howarth <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0120291.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] showed that glutamine was the principal amino acid accumulated in the grain, and that its accumulation occurred in the first seven days of grain filling. It may therefore be hypothesised that this key amino-acid may be limiting in the context of a strong demand over a short period of time.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study based on a semi-hydroponic culture in controlled conditions of wheat cv. R&#xE9;cital shows that post-flowering NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is controlled by N status at flowering in early stages following flowering. Latter in the cycle, during the active grain development phase, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake appeared to be regulated by N demand for growth, although this study did not allow to functionally demonstrate this hypothesis. <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> seems to play a major role in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, with expression patterns in both N4 and N10 treatments that were positively correlated with those of the main genes involved in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction and assimilation. This study also shows that root [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] could play an important role in the regulation of <italic>TaNRT2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression. These findings were obtained on wheat plants at a developmental stage and with a canopy structure that are both meaningful for the underlying agronomic question asked. We believe these results form a good working basis for future research on genetic variability associated with the control of post-flowering N uptake with a long-term goal of forcing a break in the negative relationship between grain protein and grain yield.</p>
