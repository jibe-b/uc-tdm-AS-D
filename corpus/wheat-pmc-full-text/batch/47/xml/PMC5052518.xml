      <abstract>
        <p>Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) hold promising future for sustainable agriculture. Here, we demonstrate a carotenoid producing halotolerant PGPR <italic>Dietzia natronolimnaea</italic> STR1 protecting wheat plants from salt stress by modulating the transcriptional machinery responsible for salinity tolerance in plants. The expression studies confirmed the involvement of ABA-signalling cascade, as <italic>TaABARE</italic> and <italic>TaOPR1</italic> were upregulated in PGPR inoculated plants leading to induction of <italic>TaMYB</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY</italic> expression followed by stimulation of expression of a plethora of stress related genes. Enhanced expression of <italic>TaST</italic>, a salt stress-induced gene, associated with promoting salinity tolerance was observed in PGPR inoculated plants in comparison to uninoculated control plants. Expression of SOS pathway related genes (<italic>SOS1</italic> and <italic>SOS4</italic>) was modulated in PGPR-applied wheat shoots and root systems. Tissue-specific responses of ion transporters <italic>TaNHX1</italic>, <italic>TaHAK</italic>, and <italic>TaHKT1</italic>, were observed in PGPR-inoculated plants. The enhanced gene expression of various antioxidant enzymes such as <italic>APX</italic>, <italic>MnSOD</italic>, <italic>CAT</italic>, <italic>POD</italic>, <italic>GPX</italic> and <italic>GR</italic> and higher proline content in PGPR-inoculated wheat plants contributed to increased tolerance to salinity stress. Overall, these results indicate that halotolerant PGPR-mediated salinity tolerance is a complex phenomenon that involves modulation of ABA-signalling, SOS pathway, ion transporters and antioxidant machinery.</p>

    <p>The continually growing world population presents a focal challenge for existing agricultural practices to warranty solution to a steadily escalating demand in food production. This increasing want for food is paralleled by striking losses of arable land owing to rising severity of soil annihilation by abiotic environmental conditions. Salinity is a major environmental stress that severely affecting plant productivity worldwide. Exposure of plants to excess salt triggers imbalance of ions, ion toxicity-induced metabolism imbalances and hyperosmotic stress induced water deficit. Plants follow various kinds of salt-tolerant mechanisms like osmolytes and polyamines synthesis, reducing reactive oxygen species level by following antioxidant defense mechanism, and ions transport and their compartmentalization. Plants have stress-specific adaptive responses as well as the response that protects plants against more than one environmental stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Numerous abiotic stress-related genes, transcription factors and regulatory elements in promoters, have been characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Plants utilize three strategies to prevent as well as adapt to high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations: (i) active Na<sup>+</sup> efflux, (ii) Na<sup>+</sup> influx prevention and (iii) Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalization in vacuoles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Antiporters play a significant role in ion homeostasis in plants. Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters (SOS1 and NHX1) minimize the cytotoxicity by maintaining the optimal cytosolic ions concentration. NHX1, located in tonoplast reduces cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration by pumping Na<sup>+</sup> in to the vacuole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, whereas plasma membrane localized SOS1 extrudes Na<sup>+</sup> in apoplasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and both of these process are driven by proton motive force generated by the H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Salinity alters the normal homeostasis of the cell and causes an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Under optimal growth conditions, antioxidant defense mechanisms of plants can cope with increased ROS level, whereas, during stress conditions, the antioxidant capacity is overcome by ROS production. Therefore, tight regulation of the steady-state concentrations of ROS by antioxidative mechanism is critical to minimize the oxidative stress-mediated damage in plant cells and consequently allowing ROS to perform useful functions as signal molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are a group of microbes which colonize the plant roots and improve plant growth either directly or indirectly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Various studies have been already published that explain the effect of PGPR in relieving abiotic stress in different crop plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. PGPR promote plant growth by altering the selectivity of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sustain a higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in plants under salt stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. With significant improvements in our understanding of PGPR-mediated salinity tolerance in host plant, efforts are being made to understand the tolerance mechanism at the gene expression level. Thus, plant cellular and molecular responses which are generally studied during interactions with various types of symbiotic as well as mutualistic microbes are of great interest, since the responses may be related to an essential process for establishing different relationships between plants and microbes. There are diverse PGPR-induced changes in plants, and growth promotion perhaps results due to a complex combination of various PGPR-induced mechanisms that affect both plant development as well as plant nutrition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses have been conducted for only a few rhizobacterial strains to unravel the changes in molecular mechanisms in plants associated with PGPR-mediated plant growth promotion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Further understanding of the primary mechanisms employed by these bacteria will likely accelerate the recognition of PGPR as appropriate and efficient adjuncts to agricultural practice.</p>
    <p>In our earlier experiments, we identified some PGPRs capable of inducing tolerance against NaCl stress in wheat plants (data unpublished); of these <italic>Dietzia natronolimnaea</italic> strain, STR1 was found to provide maximum protection to the plants under salt stress. <italic>D. natronolimnaea</italic> strain STR1 was also found to protect <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> plant from salt stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. With the aim of understanding the possible mechanisms involved in PGPR-mediated salinity tolerance in wheat plants, we studied the expression of different genes involved in salt stress tolerance in plants.</p>

        <title>Effect of <italic>Dietzia natronolimnaea</italic> strain STR1 inoculation on wheat growth</title>
        <p>The influence of STR1-inoculation on wheat growth was studied in both saline and non-saline environment. A significant increase in growth of STR1-inoculated wheat was found as compared to uninoculated (control) wheat under both non-saline and saline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). In the case of wheat plants grown in soil, a 57% reduction in dry weight was observed in uninoculated salt-stressed plants in comparison to the non-saline control. PGPR applied plants recorded improved growth in terms of dry weight and plant height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). A marked effect of STR1 inoculation, as well as salinity stress on growth of hydroponically grown wheat plants, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). STR1-inoculated plants recorded higher biomass, shoot and root elongation compare to un-inoculated plants under both non-saline and saline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>The effect of salt stress and PGPR inoculation in wheat plants on abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism was studied through the change in gene expression patterns of an ABA-responsive gene (<italic>ABARE</italic>) and <italic>TaOPR1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The expression pattern of ABA-responsive gene and <italic>TaOPR1</italic> in both wheat shoot and root were similar.

        <title>Expression of genes related to Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway</title>
        <p>The quantitative expression patterns of <italic>SOS1</italic> and <italic>SOS4</italic> genes in shoot and root of wheat plants under salinity stress and PGPR inoculation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>
        <p>Analysis of variance for <italic>SOS</italic> pathway genes showed the differential response of shoot under salinity stress as well as PGPR inoculation. PGPR inoculated non-stressed plants recorded a 40% increase in <italic>SOS1</italic> expression in comparison to the uninoculated control plants. Application of salinity stress lowered <italic>SOS1</italic> gene expression in shoots of both uninoculated and PGPR inoculated plants. However, PGPR-inoculated salt-stressed plants recorded 2 fold higher <italic>SOS1</italic> expression in comparison to the uninoculated salt-stressed plants.</p>
        <p>The gene expression profile of <italic>SOS1</italic> in roots varied with the application of salinity stress and PGPR inoculation. Similar to the shoot response, PGPR inoculated non-stressed plants recorded the highest expression whereas the salt-stressed plants recorded a decrease in the expression levels.

        <p><italic>SOS4</italic> expression level in both shoots and roots varied with the treatments. Application of salt stress reduced the expression of <italic>SOS4</italic> in shoots of uninoculated control plants. However, salt stress could not affect the expression of <italic>SOS4</italic> in PGPR inoculated shoots significantly.</p>
        <p>Under non-saline condition, <italic>SOS4</italic> expression in roots was higher (65%) in PGPR inoculated plants compared to uninoculated control plants. Salt stress reduced the expression of <italic>SOS4</italic> in roots of both uninoculated and PGPR inoculated plants.

Salt-stressed uninoculated plants recorded a 60 and 80% decrease in <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> expression level in the shoots and roots respectively. However, PGPR-inoculated salt-stressed plants recorded an improvement in the gene expression level as compared to the un-inoculated salt-stressed plants.</p>
        <p><italic>TaWRKY17</italic> expression pattern in shoots and roots was similar to that of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> across the treatments. PGPR-inoculated plants recorded improved <italic>TaWRKY17</italic> gene expression in comparison to uninoculated (control) plants under both non-saline and saline conditions.</p>
        <p><italic>TaMYB33</italic> expression profile was similar in the wheat shoot and root across the treatments. Among the non-saline plants, the PGPR-inoculated plants recorded approximately 300% (3-fold) increase in the <italic>TaMYB33</italic> expression levels in both shoots and roots. Application of salt stress reduced the <italic>TaMYB33</italic> expression both shoots (50% reduction) and roots (80% reduction) as compared to their respective control plants. The <italic>TaMYB33</italic> expression levels were found to be ameliorated in the PGPR-inoculated salt affected plants in comparison to the control plants.</p>
        <p>The expression profile of <italic>TaST</italic> (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> salt-tolerant) gene was similar in the roots and shoots of wheat.

        <p>To evaluate the effect of salt stress treatments on the antioxidant capacity of PGPR-inoculated plants the gene expression patterns of antioxidant enzymes (POD, CAT, APX, GR, GPX, MnSOD) were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
        <p>The expression profile of the antioxidant enzymes followed a similar pattern in wheat roots and shoots. The gene expression patterns for all the antioxidants were similar for uninoculated (control) and PGPR-inoculated salt-stressed plants.

Our results suggested that <italic>D. natronolimnaea</italic> STR1 promotes the growth of plants in control conditions as well as under salt stress as illustrated by improved dry weight of wheat plants in both glasshouse and hydroponics. STR1 inoculation affected the root architecture of wheat plant as observed by increased root length under both non-saline and saline conditions. Previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> have suggested varying response of rhizobacteria on plant root architecture indicating the specificity of plant-rhizobacterial associations. A recent report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> suggests salt-induced burst in ABA production is correlated with organ-specific carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. The plants inoculated with <italic>D. natronolimnaea</italic> STR1 recorded higher proline and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) levels under salt-stressed conditions in comparison to the un-inoculated salt affected plants. MDA content, a result of lipid peroxidation, is a marker of the extent of membrane damage owed to oxidative damage due to the salt stress. Reduced MDA content during salt stress in the PGPR inoculated plants matched with the earlier observations correlating reduced lipid peroxidation to better stress tolerance mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
      <p>The issue of host plant specificity has been well studied in parasitic and mutualistic interactions; however, the question of whether PGPR efficiently interacts only with a specific host remains scantily conversed. Contrary to the popular theory, few reports have suggested strain-specific molecular responses of plants to rhizobacterial inoculation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Rhizobacteria-mediated plant growth is a multigenic process which may be specific to the participating rhizobacteria and plant species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The study was hence, conducted to identify the changes in the expression patterns of genes participating in inherent salt tolerance when inoculated with PGPR under non-stressed as well as salt-stressed conditions. The results of the study support the &#x201C;additive hypothesis&#x201D;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, suggesting plant growth as affected by bacterial inoculation under salinity stress is a complex phenomenon and involves a cumulative effect of changes in various genes in the global plant metabolic pathways.</p>
      <p>Salt stress in plants is a cumulative effect of osmotic and ionic stress which negatively affects the plant growth and yield. Multiple genes are involved in salt tolerance mechanism. A plethora of stress related genes conferring salt stress tolerance in plants have been reported to be involved in signal transduction, ion transporters, transcription regulation and metabolic pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Osmotic stress can be alleviated through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways whereas ionic stress is mitigated through the participation of Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway and ion transporters via ion homeostasis.</p>
      <p>A definite signaling pathway required for the control of ionic homeostasis in plants is the SOS signaling pathway which is a key mechanism for exclusion of Na<sup>+</sup> and ion homeostasis control at cellular level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. SOS1 is one of the many plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters involved in salt tolerance and is crucial for regulating the long distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport from root to shoot. <italic>SOS4</italic> encodes a pyridoxal kinase, involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal-5-phosphate, which acts as an essential cofactor for numerous cellular enzymes. SOS4 regulates Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis by modulating the activities of ion transporters. It was also suggested that SOS4 plays a precise role in root hair development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The results of the present study indicate a decrease in expression levels of <italic>TaSOS1</italic> and <italic>TaSOS4</italic> in shoots and roots under salinity stress which is in contrast with its expression pattern in root reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. This could be due to the effect of long-term exposure (10 d) to salt stress in the present experiment whereas Ramezani <italic>et al</italic>. 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> reported <italic>TaSOS1</italic> and <italic>TaSOS4</italic> expression up to the 72&#x2009;h of salt exposure. The PGPR-inoculated plants always had higher <italic>SOS</italic> genes expression under salt stress compared to salt stressed un-inoculated plants, suggesting their participation in salt tolerance mechanisms. <italic>SOS4</italic> gene is associated with auxin and ethylene mechanisms as well as the development of root hair in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The improved <italic>SOS4</italic> expression in PGPR inoculated wheat roots can thus be correlated with improvement in root length and overall plant growth in salt-stressed plants.</p>
      <p>WRKY TFs play crucial roles in the regulation of many stress induced reactions in plants but until recently unravelling their roles in various abiotic stress responses has lagged behind that of biotic stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> has been reported to confer salt and drought stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco by regulating the expression of stress-related genes, thus protecting plants from damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In the present study, <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> expression was found to be reduced in the salt-stressed plants. However, PGPR-inoculated salt-stressed plants recorded increased <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> expression. Salinity and drought stress have been reported to upregulate <italic>TaWRKY17</italic> expression in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The expression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>, <italic>TaWRKY17</italic> was downregulated under the influence of salinity stress, might be due to long term exposure to salt stress. PGPR-inoculated plants had higher <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>, <italic>TaWRKY17</italic> expression in saline condition compare to un-inoculated plants might be a reason to provide tolerance effect under salt stress. The results indicate a positive effect of PGPR inoculation on the expression levels of transcription factors (TFs), hence improved salinity tolerance. WRKY TFs play the important roles in regulation of water/drought-stress by modulating the cellular osmotic balance, ROS scavenging mechanism and expression of different stress-related genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> as evident by the enhanced and improved growth in PGPR applied plants under glasshouse conditions. Plant growth inhibiting rhizobacteria have been found to induce the response of <italic>WRKY18</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> demonstrating the direct plant-microbe interaction effects at gene transcript levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p>
      <p>MYB proteins are one of the main factors for regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. <italic>TaMYB33</italic> expression has been found to be upregulated during drought, salt and ABA treatments. The ectopic over-expression of <italic>TaMYB33</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses with no growth inhibition, indicates that the <italic>TaMYB33</italic> is a promising gene candidate for genetic manipulation studies in wheat for providing tolerance to abiotic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In the present study because of the long term exposure to salt stress the <italic>TaMYB33</italic> expression was reduced in both root and shoot whereas STR1 inoculated plants had higher <italic>TaMYB33</italic> transcript compared to un-inoculated plant during salt stress probably led to increased salt tolerance. Previously reported that overexpression of <italic>MYB</italic> genes in rice resulted increase in soluble sugars and proline accumulation due to upregulation of proline synthesis and transport related genes, and less accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA under salt stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, suggesting a probable reason for higher proline and reduced MDA levels in rhizobacteria inoculated salt-stressed plants as they had higher <italic>TaMYB</italic> expression compared to un-inoculated salt stressed plant. It has been found that both the SOS pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and the SOS-independent pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> are involved in the perception of the salt stress signal, ionic absorption and intracellular ion compartmentation, however, the involvement of <italic>TaMYB33</italic> is a question yet to be answered. A putative MYB like transcription factor (<italic>LjMAMI</italic>) has been observed to be induced during the mycorrhization process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> indicating the influence of plant growth promoting micro-organism on the gene regulatory system of plants. Hence, it can be concluded that the plant-rhizobacteria interactions are governed by the specificity of interactions at metabolic as well as molecular paradigms.</p>
      <p>Ion transporters are known as terminal determinants of ionic homeostasis under salt- stressed conditions. Over-expression of <italic>AtNHX1</italic> has been correlated with improved salinity tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Likewise, in the present study, higher expression of <italic>TaNHX</italic> in PGPR-inoculated plants was observed in both shoot and roots in comparison to their un-inoculated counterparts suggesting a likely role of halotolerant rhizobacteria in modulating ion transport mechanisms. SOS1 has been associated with Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> indicating complex and intertwined mechanisms responsible for enhanced salinity tolerance in plants. Involvement of HKT transporters in salt tolerance mechanism has been reported in both dicot and monocot crops<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Hyperaccumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in shoots and lower Na<sup>+</sup> in roots have been observed in <italic>AtHKT1</italic> mutants indicating a direct role of the gene in Na<sup>+</sup> movement across plant tissues. The <italic>TaHKT1</italic> expression in the present study has been observed to be considerably higher in PGPR-inoculated plants under both non-saline and saline conditions which could be attributed to improved growth in bacterized plants in comparison to control plants. In congruence with the present study, the tissue-specific response of <italic>HKT1</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> inoculated with <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> GB03 has been earlier reported to enhance salt tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. HAK type transporters are multigene family members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, common ice plant and barley, and the various genes show specific type of expression patterns in different tissues of the plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Higher <italic>TaHAK</italic> expression levels can be correlated with improved salinity tolerance in wheat plants. Owing to the tissue-specific response of <italic>HAK</italic> expression, the transcript levels, unlike other transporters, varied in wheat roots and shoots. <italic>TaST</italic> is reported to be a salt-inducible gene and reduce intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration, increase K<sup>+</sup> content, and maintain a high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. <italic>TaST</italic> expression in roots was higher in STR1 treated plants indicating the role of rhizobacteria in triggering the <italic>TaST</italic> expression hence enhanced salt tolerance. Pathogen invasion, wounding, and oxidative stress and events associated with ROS acceleration have been documented to up-regulate <italic>OPR1</italic> genes and have been suggested to be associated with antioxidant activities mediating stress tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. It was observed that <italic>TaOPR</italic> responds to salinity stress in ABA-dependent manner and its overexpression improve salinity tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and wheat. Hence, higher <italic>TaOPR1</italic> expression levels can be correlated with enhanced antioxidant response.</p>
      <p>Application of abiotic stresses causes an increase in cellular level of ROS like superoxide radical (O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>), hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), leading to lipid peroxidation of membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Plants have different antioxidant molecules and enzymes that reduce ROS level and alleviate oxidative stress. In the present study, MDA levels reduced in PGPR-inoculated plants, whereas, enzyme activities of CAT and APX in PGPR-inoculated plants growing under NaCl-stress conditions increased significantly when compared with that of the non-inoculated NaCl-stressed plants. The transcript of genes for antioxidative enzymes (<italic>APX</italic>, <italic>CAT</italic>, <italic>POD</italic>, <italic>MnSOD</italic>, <italic>GPX</italic> and <italic>GR</italic>) increased in the PGPR-inoculated plants. Plant tolerance to salinity stress was correlated with the increased expression of <italic>CAT</italic>, <italic>APX</italic>, <italic>MnSOD</italic>, <italic>POD</italic>, <italic>GPX</italic>, and <italic>GR</italic>, suggesting that PGPR triggered the abiotic stress-related defense pathways. Previous reports have demonstrated that plant-associated microorganisms attenuate salt-induced lipid peroxidation as well has higher CAT and APX activities resulting in enhanced salt tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. PGPR have also been known to mediate abiotic stress tolerance in plants through modulation of ROS-scavenging enzyme expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, PGPR <italic>D. natronolimnaea</italic> STR1 promotes growth and protects wheat plants from damage to salt stress. This rhizobacterium appears to confer tolerance to salt stress, at least partly, via modulating the <italic>TaMYB</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY</italic> transcription factors. These transcription factors activate adaptive responses by inducing expression of genes encoding ion channels and transporters to eliminate the accumulation of toxic ions in the cytosol, genes involved in the synthesis of osmoprotectants and antioxidant defense mechanism to reduce reactive oxygen species and MDA contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). However, further evidences are needed to verify the exact role of these transcription factors along with other putative mechanisms participating in PGPR-mediated salinity tolerance in plants.</p>

        <p>Total RNA was extracted from the shoots and roots of hydroponically grown 12&#x2009;d old wheat seedlings treated with 100&#x2009;mM NaCl and PGPR using TRI-reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Inc. MO, USA). DNA contamination from total RNA preparation was removed by using RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa Bio Dalian CO., Ltd). cDNA was synthesized from approximately 3&#x2009;&#x3BC;g of total RNA using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). PCR conditions were 10&#x2009;min at 95&#x2009;<sup>o</sup>C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x2009;<sup>o</sup>C for 15&#x2009;sec each and annealing/extension at 60&#x2009;<sup>o</sup>C for 1&#x2009;min each. Primers used for the relative quantification of biosynthetic gene transcripts are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. The threshold (Ct) value for each gene was normalized against the Ct for actin from wheat which was used as the constitutive reference transcript. Uninoculated plants growing in non-saline condition were used as the calibrator. Fluorescent signal intensities were recorded and analyzed on a StepOnePlus<sup>TM</sup> (Applied Biosystems) Real-Time PCR System.</p>

        <p>Twelve days old wheat plantlets, grown in Hoagland&#x2019;s hydroponic system, bacterial cells (<italic>D. natronolimnaea</italic> STR1) collected from mid-log phase and wheat plantlets inoculated with bacteria STR1, were washed with 0.2&#x2009;M Sorensen&#x2019;s phosphate buffer two times. Furthermore, each sample was fixed with fixing solution (prepared in 0.2&#x2009;M Sorensen&#x2019;s phosphate buffer) containing 4% (v/v) formaldehyde and 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 4&#x2009;h at room temperature. Fixed samples were washed with 0.2&#x2009;M Sorensen&#x2019;s phosphate buffer three times (each wash was given for 15&#x2009;min). In addition, each sample was dehydrated through a graded series of absolute ethanol (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% respectively). Each sample was dried in a critical point dryer in a CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and examined at 20&#x2009;kv in a JEOL JXA 8100 scanning electron microscope.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>Statistical analysis of data were carried out by applying ANOVA, suitable to completely randomized design (CRD) using the software PASW Statistics 18. Significant differences among different treatments were carried out using Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range test at a significance level of P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05. Two trials were conducted for the experiment and both had a similar variance value; hence, the data of both experiments were combined for further analysis. The gene expression data were analyzed using Duncan&#x2019;s Test (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).</p>

        <title>Overview of modulation of expression of genes involved in PGPR <italic>Dietzia natronolimnaea</italic> STR1-mediated salinity tolerance in wheat plants.</title>
        <p>In the early steps of interaction, <italic>Dietzia natronolimnaea</italic> STR1 triggered signal transduction which modulated the expression of several genes responsible for salt tolerance. Based on the results we propose that carotenoid producing <italic>D. natronolimnaea</italic> STR1 participates in salt tolerance via both ABA-mediated and SOS-mediated pathways by up-regulating the expression of ABA-signalling cascade genes (<italic>TaABARE</italic> and <italic>TaOPR1</italic>), leading to induction of <italic>TaMYB</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY</italic> expression followed by stimulation of expression of a plethora of stress related genes including <italic>TaST</italic>, a salt stress-induced gene, associated with promoting salinity tolerance. Modulation of SOS pathway related genes (<italic>SOS1</italic> and <italic>SOS4</italic>) and tissue specific responses of ion transporters <italic>TaNHX1</italic>, <italic>TaHAK</italic> and <italic>TaHKT1</italic>, were observed in PGPR applied plants. The enhanced gene expression of various antioxidant enzymes such as <italic>APX</italic>, <italic>MnSOD</italic>, <italic>CAT</italic>, <italic>POD</italic>, <italic>GPX</italic> and <italic>GR</italic> and higher proline content in PGPR-treated wheat plants contributed to increased plant tolerance to salinity stress. The red coloured bold arrows indicate the up-regulation or down-regulation of genes.</p>
