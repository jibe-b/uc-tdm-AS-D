      <abstract>
        <p>A wheat stay-green mutant, <italic>tasg1</italic>, was observed to exhibit significantly delayed senescence in the late developmental stage. The photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaf was greater in <italic>tasg1</italic> than in wild type (WT) plants. In addition, the grain volume of <italic>tasg1</italic> was significantly higher than that of WT at the early filling stage. The content of various cytokinins (CKs) in the grain was significantly higher in <italic>tasg1</italic> than in WT and was accompanied by an upregulated expression of some cell cycle-related genes. Examination of the metabolism of soluble sugars in <italic>tasg1</italic> and WT revealed that the concentrations of glucose (Glu), fructose (Fru), and sucrose (Suc) were higher in the flag leaves and grains of <italic>tasg1</italic> than in WT plants. The activities of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SuSy), and cell wall invertase (CW-invertase) were higher in <italic>tasg1</italic>, suggesting an altered metabolism and transport of soluble sugars. Furthermore, when <italic>tasg1</italic> was treated with the CK inhibitor lovastatin, the activity of invertase was inhibited and was associated with premature senescence phenotype. However, the activity of invertase was partially recovered in <italic>tasg1</italic> when treated with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). The trend of change in the concentrations of Glu, Fru, and Suc was similar to that of invertase. Our results suggest that CKs might regulate the stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic> by regulating the invertase activity involved in Suc remobilization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Senescence is an internally programmed degenerative process leading to death in plants. Premature leaf senescence could be responsible for low grain yield. Compared to wild type (WT) plants, stay-green or non-yellowing mutants of various plant species have been reported to maintain leaf greenness for longer time during senescence and are ideal materials for studying the mechanisms underlying plant senescence. Some stay-green mutants maintain photosynthetic activity for longer durations and are, therefore, expected to have a higher yield [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161351.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying the stay-green or delayed senescence phenotype remain unclear, to date.</p>
      <p>Cytokinins (CKs) are known to play important roles in plant growth and developmental processes, including senescence [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These processes are linked to the demand for carbohydrates, regulation of assimilate partitioning [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], sink strength [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and source-sink relationships [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Sink strength is affected by cell division. CKs play important roles in the regulation of different cell cycle phases, including the G1/S transition, progression through S phase, and G2/M transition [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161351.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, CKs are involved in the production of carbohydrates. In previous studies, CKs were demonstrated to promote chloroplast biogenesis, increase the photosynthetic rate, and affect the abundance of proteins associated with photosynthesis, including Rubisco [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of the light-harvesting complex [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CKs affect the distribution of nutrients and further modulate sink strength as indicated by their ability to establish local metabolic sinks, which has been demonstrated by mobilisation of radiolabeled nutrients, such as sugars, from other parts of the plant to CK-treated areas [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Sucrose (Suc) metabolism and transport are very important for growth and senescence. These processes depend on sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SuSy), and invertase (C-Invertase, V-Invertase, CW-Invertase) activities. SPS and SuSy play important roles in regulating the synthesis of sucrose [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161351.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The activity of invertase has been reported to be dominant during initiation and expansion of sink [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Plants contain neutral invertases, localized to the cytosol (C-Invertase), and acidic invertases, localized to the vacuoles (V-Invertase) and cell wall (CW-Invertase) in the apoplast [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular, extracellular invertase (CW-Invertase) has crucial functions, both in source-sink regulation and in supplying carbohydrates to sink tissues, and is, therefore, a central modulator of sink activity [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161351.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161351.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. CKs are also involved in the regulation of invertase activity; extracellular invertase activity is usually high in tissues with an elevated cytokinin concentration [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>A wheat stay-green mutant, <italic>tasg1</italic>, was previously generated via mutation breeding of HeSheng2 (HS2) cultivar in our laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We observed that <italic>tasg1</italic> was a functional stay-green mutant with delayed senescence. The content of CKs, the stability of proteins in thylakoid membranes, and the antioxidant capacity of <italic>tasg1</italic> were consistently higher than those of WT during senescence [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161351.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This resulted in a higher biomass of <italic>tasg1</italic> compared to that of WT under drought stress. In the present study, we found that the grain volume in <italic>tasg1</italic> was higher than that in WT at the early filling stages. We, therefore, made an attempt to (i) analyze the involvement of cell division and CKs in the changed grain volume in <italic>tasg1</italic>; (ii) investigate the Suc metabolism in the leaves (source) and grains (sink) of <italic>tasg1</italic> and analyze its involvement in the high biomass and stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic>, and (iii) determine the relationship between CK and Suc metabolism in the stay-green phenotype of tasg1. These data are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the CK metabolism and delayed senescence in wheat.</p>

        <title>Field experiments</title>
        <p>Field experiments were carried out at the farm of Shandong Agricultural University, China. Six interspersed plots (four m<sup>2</sup>) were selected randomly in the field (random block design); the experiment was conducted in triplicate with three plots being used for each genotype. Wheat seeds were sown in eight lines separated by a width of 25 cm, at a depth of two cm, and with an interval of five cm between two seeds in the same line. The growth and development of the wheat plants were managed according to conventional agricultural techniques.</p>

        <p>The methods for obtaining the wheat seedlings were modified according to Tian et al. [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. WT and <italic>tasg1</italic> seeds were germinated on filter paper moistened with water for 24 h at 25 &#xB1; 1&#xB0;C after being sterilized with 0.2% sodium hypochlorite. The seeds (hydroponic) were then placed in a well-ordered fashion on a nylon gauze sheet at the appropriate density and cultured in trays (25 cm &#xD7; 18 cm &#xD7; 5 cm) containing water. These trays were placed in a growth chamber at 25 &#xB1; 1&#xB0;C under a 12 h light (300 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) dark cycle and a relative humidity of 70%.</p>
        <p>To induce leaf senescence in wheat seedlings, we used smaller than two-week-old seedlings in a hydroponic system without nutrients. <italic>Tasg1</italic> showed significantly delayed senescence phenotype in the late growth stage (nine days) compared with WT.</p>
        <p>For lovastatin treatment, the wheat seedlings were cultivated in a 40 &#x3BC;M lovastatin solution (containing 1% acetone) when they were grown to 7 d.</p>
        <p>For 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) treatment, the wheat seedlings were sprayed in a 100 &#x3BC;M BAP solution (Sigma) with 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20.</p>

        <p>The methods for the extraction and purification of isopentenyl adenine (IPA), zeatin riboside (ZR), and dihydrozeatin riboside (DHZR) were modified according to Degenhardt et al. [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The fresh leaves or roots (0.5g) were extracted and purified by passing C18-Sep-Pak cartridges. The mouse monoclonal antigens and antibodies against DHZR, ZR, and IPA used in ELISA were produced at the Phytohormones Research Institute (China Agricultural University). ELISA was performed on a 96-well microtitration plate. Each well on the plate was coated with 50&#x3BC;l sample and 50&#x3BC;l antigens (0.25 &#x3BC;g mL<sup>-1)</sup> against the hormones. The coated plates were incubated for 0.5h at 37&#xB0;C in a wet box.

The homogenization buffer was 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM PMSF, 2% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mM benzamidine. Thehomogenate was mixed for 30 min at 4&#xB0;C before centrifugation. The invertase reactions were carried out in K-phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 6.8 for cytosolic invertae, and pH 4.5 for vacuolar and cell wall invertases, with 125 mM sucrose as a substrate. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 26&#xB0;C and stopped by incubating for 5 min at 95&#xB0;C. The amount of glucose liberated in the reaction was determined as above.

The difference in the change in photosynthetic rate (Pn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) between <italic>tasg1</italic> and WT indicated the difference in light energy fixation during leaf growth.

The change in stomatal conductance (Gs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) was consistent with the changes in E at the late filling stage.

      <p>For centuries, selective breeding has played an important role in increasing the crop yield and improving the product quality [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The yield is often reduced because of less photosynthesis when premature senescence occurs, but it is also lost if the resources are not efficiently recycled to the grain at the end of the growing season. The latter cause is related to the metabolism and transportation of sugars.</p>
      <p>In a previous report, we demonstrated that <italic>tasg1</italic> could retain high photosynthetic capacity and inhibit chlorophyll degradation at the late developmental stage [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, CK metabolism was altered in <italic>tasg1</italic> and was involved in their stay-green phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that the biomass accumulation in <italic>tasg1</italic> was higher than that in WT, as indicated by their larger stem and higher leaf weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161351.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Photosynthesis is a key underlying factor regulating plant biomass. At later filling stages, especially from 21 to 32 d after flowering, Pn was always higher in <italic>tasg1</italic> than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), coinciding with higher Gs, E, Fv/Fm, and &#x3A6;PSII values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g002">Fig 2C&#x2013;2F</xref>), which suggested a greater photosynthetic capacity in <italic>tasg1</italic> than in WT at the filling stage. The greater photosynthetic capacity might play a major role in <italic>tasg1</italic> having higher biomass than WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161351.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

The inhibition of bud outgrowth in the tiller inhibition (<italic>tin</italic>) mutant is associated with a reduction in the expression of marker genes, <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic> for S, and <italic>CDKB</italic> for M phases of the cell cycle [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In our previous study, we described the association of the stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic> with altered CK metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the present study, we found that the levels of active CK were higher in the grains of <italic>tasg1</italic> at the early filling stage (7 d) than those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g003">Fig 3D&#x2013;3F</xref>). The expression of <italic>CDKB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and <italic>CycD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) might play an important role in the enhancement of the grain volume (sink) in <italic>tasg1</italic>. We, therefore, speculated that the increased content of active CKs could be involved in the larger grain volume of <italic>tasg1</italic> by regulation of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g004">Fig 4</xref>) at the early filling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Changes in carbohydrate metabolism could be an important component in the stay-green phenotype and the smaller grain weight of <italic>tasg1</italic></title>
        <p>Carbohydrates produced by photosynthetically active source leaves are transported to heterotrophic sink tissues of the plant, such as those present in the growth zones and storage organs. Partitioning of photoassimilates from source organs to various sinks is under strict developmental control [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Maria et al. [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that the stay-green phenotype was related to Suc metabolism and transportation in transgenic tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) plants.</p>
        <p>We observed that the concentrations of soluble sugars in <italic>tasg1</italic> (flag leaf and grain) at the late filling stage were significantly higher than those in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The content of Suc in the flag leaf of <italic>tasg1</italic> was consistent with the photosynthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The high content of Suc in <italic>tasg1</italic> at the late filling stage was consistent with the up-regulated expression of a Suc-inducible gene and downregulation of a marker gene for Suc starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The higher content of soluble sugars in <italic>tasg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g005">Fig 5</xref>) implied that more soluble sugars were transported to sink tissues in <italic>tasg1</italic>. On the contrary, the grains of <italic>tasg1</italic> were smaller than those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting a low conversion rate of soluble sugars to starch in <italic>tasg1</italic> at the late filling stage. This indicates that more soluble sugars were retained in the vegetative organs of <italic>tasg1</italic>, such as leaves and stems. Indeed, Fru pools in the vegetative tissues preserve the carbon flux in the kernel when the transport of the synthesized photosynthesis products is insufficient [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The increased content of Fru in <italic>tasg1</italic> might be one of the reasons for larger biomass in the late growth stage. Sufficient nutrients in the vegetative organs of <italic>tasg1</italic> could be one of the most important components responsible for the stay-green characteristic of <italic>tasg1</italic>.</p>
        <p>Suc turnover is accomplished by the activity of the Suc-metabolizing enzymes, such as SPS and SuSy. Suc is predominantly synthesized by SPS, and is subsequently cleaved, mainly by SuSy [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The higher activities of SPS and SuSy in <italic>tasg1</italic> also suggest an active carbohydrate metabolism in the leaves and grains at the late filling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

        <title>CK-regulated invertase activity might be one of the most important factors involved in the stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic></title>
        <p>The activity of CW-Invertases at the site of phloem unloading has been proposed to be a major factor controlling the sink strength by drawing Suc [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our data for the flag leaves show that the activities of all the three types of invertases were higher in <italic>tasg1</italic> than in WT at the late filling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g008">Fig 8A&#x2013;8C</xref>). However, in the grains, only CW-Invertase activity was higher in <italic>tasg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), suggesting that Suc was actively utilized in <italic>tasg1</italic>. Surprisingly, the study showed that the grains were smaller in <italic>tasg1</italic> at the late filling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We propose that the ineffective conversion from soluble sugars (Glu) to starch might be involved in the smaller grain size.</p>
        <p>The expression of <italic>Ivr1</italic> and <italic>Ivr3</italic>, which code for CW-Invertase, was significantly elevated in <italic>tasg1</italic> in different tissues at the late filling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g009">Fig 9</xref>). These data suggest that, in addition to the leaves and grains, carbohydrate metabolism was also active in other organs in <italic>tasg1</italic>. When excess Suc is decomposed into Glu and Fru and is retained in different tissues instead of grains at the late filling stage, the senescence of vegetative organs is delayed [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The higher biomass of <italic>tasg1</italic> than that of WT also supports this notion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161351.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>In a previous study, CKs were shown to upregulate the expression of genes encoding cell wall invertases [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the activity of invertase was essential for CK-induced nutrient redistribution and delayed senescence [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Herein, we studied the involvement of CKs in the invertase activity in <italic>tasg1</italic> seedlings. When treated with the CK inhibitor lovastatin, both WT and <italic>tasg1</italic> seedlings exhibited premature senescence phenotype and the activity of invertase was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g010">Fig 10</xref>). However, the effects of lovastatin were greater on tasg1 than on WT, suggesting a major function of CKs in the activity of invertase and stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic>. When treated with BAP, the premature phenotype was partially recovered and the activities of CW-Invertase, V-Invertase, and C-Invertase were increased in <italic>tasg1</italic>. Concomitantly, the contents of Glu and Fru were altered in WT and <italic>tasg1</italic>; however, the change was more prominent in <italic>tasg1</italic>. These results reinforce the opinion that extracellular invertase and soluble sugars (Glu and Fru) are essential components of cytokinin-mediated delay in senescence [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and also support the view that invertases provide an important link between phytohormone action and soluble sugar metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Based on the results of the present study, as well as those reported by us earlier [<xref rid="pone.0161351.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], wherein we related the CK-regulated antioxidant competence to the stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic>, we hereby propose a model that might be involved in the stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161351.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Suc content in the leaves of <italic>tasg1</italic> was higher than that in WT because of its greater capacity for active photosynthesis. However, excess Suc was decomposed into Glu and Fru by invertase, following which the soluble carbohydrate was retained in different tissues, rather than in the grains, at the late filling stage. This resulted in the stay-green phenotype and higher biomass of <italic>tasg1</italic> but was responsible for smaller grain volume in this mutant. The invertase activity regulated by CKs was directly or indirectly involved in Suc remobilization and the stay-green phenotype of <italic>tasg1</italic>. The ineffective conversion from soluble sugars to starch might be involved in the smaller grain size in <italic>tasg1</italic>.</p>
