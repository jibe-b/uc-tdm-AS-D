      <abstract>
        <p>Ran, an important family of small GTP-binding proteins, has been shown to regulate a variety of important cellular processes in many eukaryotes. However, little is known about Ran function in pathogenic fungi. In this study, we report the identification and functional analysis of a Ran gene (designated <italic>PsRan</italic>) from <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici (Pst</italic>), an important fungal pathogen affecting wheat production worldwide. The PsRan protein contains all conserved domains of Ran GTPases and shares more than 70% identity with Ran proteins from other organisms, indicating that Ran proteins are conserved in different organisms. <italic>PsRan</italic> shows a low level of intra-species polymorphism and is localized to the nucleus. qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcript level of <italic>PsRan</italic> was induced <italic>in planta</italic> during <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> did not alter <italic>Pst</italic> virulence phenotype but impeded fungal growth of <italic>Pst</italic>. In addition, heterologous overexpression of <italic>PsRan</italic> in plant failed to induce cell death but suppressed cell death triggered by a mouse BAX gene or a <italic>Pst</italic> Ras gene. Our results suggest that <italic>PsRan</italic> is involved in the regulation of fungal growth and anti-cell death, which provides significant insight into Ran function in pathogenic fungi.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Small GTP-binding proteins in eukaryotes from yeast to human constitute a superfamily, which includes more than 100 members and is structurally classified into at least five families: Ras, Rho, Rab, Sar1/Arf, and Ran<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The Ran (Ras-related nuclear) protein was originally isolated as a homolog of Ras proteins and eukaryotes usually contain one to four Ran genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. As the only known family of small GTP-binding proteins primarily localized inside the nucleus, Ran is originally thought to be devoted to the nuclear translocation of proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, Ran is now known to expand its important influence to nuclear assembly, mRNA processing, and cell cycle control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Recent researches indicate that Ran also plays an important role in human cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and apoptotic cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, animal immunity against virus infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, animal development and reproduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and plant development and mediated responses to the environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Increased evidences suggest that Ran is involved in the regulation of a variety of important cellular processes in different eukaryotes.</p>
    <p>As with other living organisms, pathogenic fungi that are the causes of deadly diseases in human, animals, and plants use numerous signal-transduction systems to sense and respond to their environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Small GTP-binding proteins are molecular switches in cellular signal transduction pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and many members of the four families (Ras, Rho, Rab, and Sar1/Arf) in pathogenic fungi were proven to regulate a variety of important biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Noticeably, Ras proteins, the most well-known family of small GTP-binding proteins, act upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathways and appear to play important roles in fungal growth, asexual and sexual reproduction, virulence, and cell death of pathogenic fungi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Some genes encoding putative fungal Ran proteins were identified in several pathogenic fungi (<italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic>, <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>, and <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, but little is currently known about Ran function in pathogenic fungi. Thus, the identification and functional analysis of Ran genes from pathogenic fungi will lead to better understanding of their specific roles in pathogenic fungi.</p>
    <p>As an important plant pathogenic fungus, <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici (Pst</italic>) can cause the wheat stripe rust disease that is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide. Significant wheat yield losses caused by outbreaks of stripe rust have resulted in economic losses throughout human history<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Thus, the understanding of <italic>Pst</italic> pathogenesis and searching for novel pathogen control strategies are of great significance to durably control the wheat stripe rust disease. As an obligate biotroph pathogen, <italic>Pst</italic> grows only <italic>in planta</italic> and lacks an efficient and reliable system for stable transformation, which has long hindered the study of putative pathogenic genes. Recently, host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) has been developed and has proven to be a useful tool to study genes in obligate biotrophic pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Our recent study investigated the specific function of two <italic>Pst</italic> Ras genes using the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated HIGS and heterologous expression assays, which showed that <italic>PsRas1</italic> and <italic>PsRas2</italic> are involved in rust pathogenicity and cell death, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The goals of the present study were to identify gene(s) encoding Ran protein(s) from <italic>Pst</italic> and to determine its or their specific functions. We found that <italic>Pst</italic> contains only one Ran gene and it plays an important role in the regulation of fungal growth and anti-cell death, which provides significant insight into Ran function in pathogenic fungi.</p>

        <title>Identification of one Ran gene from <italic>Pst</italic></title>
        <p>One cDNA clone (WRIC_343) encoding a putative fungal Ran protein was identified in the cDNA library of <italic>Pst</italic>-infected wheat leaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Mapping to <italic>Pst</italic> genome in the Broad Institute <italic>Puccinia</italic> database showed that the corresponding gene, <italic>PSTG_13752.1</italic> (designated <italic>PsRan</italic>), has an open reading frame (ORF) of 651 bp that encodes a 216 aa protein with a predicted molecular mass of 24.07&#x2009;kDa. Further sequence alignment revealed that PsRan shows high similarity (more than 70%) with Ran proteins from other organisms, including <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The PsRan protein has four guanine nucleotide-binding domains, an effector domain, and an acidic C-terminal domain, which are the characteristics of Ran GTPases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and are highly conserved during evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>PsRan</italic> is a typical Ran gene.</p>
        <p>Because the model yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains two Ran proteins, including GSP1 and GSP2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, a BLAST search using GSP1 and GSP2 as queries in the Broad Institute <italic>Puccinia</italic> database was done to make sure whether <italic>Pst</italic> contains other genes encoding Ran proteins besides <italic>PsRan</italic>. There is no other Ran GTPase-encoding gene besides <italic>PsRan (PSTG_13752.1</italic>) in <italic>Pst</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2</xref>), indicating <italic>Pst</italic> contains only one Ran gene, which is different from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Other two wheat rust fungi in the Broad Institute <italic>Puccinia</italic> database, including <italic>P. graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici (Pgt</italic>) and <italic>P. triticina (Pt</italic>), also contain only one Ran GTPase-encoding gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition, a phylogenetic analysis of Ran proteins from various organisms resulted into two distinct phylogenetic clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Ran proteins in plants are grouped into a clade and Ran proteins in fungi and animals are grouped into another clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), indicating a closer relationship of Ran in fungi and animals.</p>

        <title>Low level of intra-species polymorphism in <italic>PsRan</italic></title>
        <p>To identify intra-species polymorphism in <italic>PsRan</italic>, we compared its ORF sequences in ten different <italic>Pst</italic> isolates, including five Chinese isolates (CYR23, CYR29, CYR31, CYR32, and Su11-4), three US isolates (PST-21, PST-43, and PST-130), and two UK isolates (PST-08-21 and PST-87-7). Only two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are observed for <italic>PsRan</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, all the two SNPs are synonymous and cannot cause the sequence change of amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>). Our results indicate that <italic>PsRan</italic> shows a low level of intra-species polymorphism and is highly conserved in different <italic>Pst</italic> isolates.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Nuclear localization of PsRan</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that Ran proteins primarily localize inside the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Because there is no effective transformation system for <italic>Pst</italic>, we conducted localization experiments of PsRan in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which are easier to operate as a model plant and fungus, respectively. When a PsRan-GFP fusion protein was heterologously expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, its fluorescence was restricted to the nucleus, while the control expressing only GFP exhibited fluorescence throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). When we transiently expressed the PsRan-GFP fusion protein in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we found that its fluorescence was again restricted to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results indicate the nuclear localization of PsRan when using a transient and distant system.</p>

        <title>Transcript level of <italic>PsRan</italic> is induced <italic>in planta</italic> during <italic>Pst</italic> infection</title>
        <p>To characterize transcript profiles of <italic>PsRan</italic> in different <italic>Pst</italic> infection stages, we assayed its transcript abundance by qRT-PCR. Compared with the transcript abundance in urediniospores, <italic>PsRan</italic> showed significantly increased transcript abundance in infected wheat leaves at 18, 24, and 48&#x2009;hours post-inoculation (hpi), which belong to the &#x201C;parasitic/biotrophic&#x201D; phase of <italic>Pst</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). At 18 hpi, the transcript of <italic>PsRan</italic> was peaked (up to 21-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Our results reveal that <italic>PsRan</italic> is an <italic>in planta</italic> induced gene and is preferentially expressed during the &#x201C;parasitic/biotrophic&#x201D; phase.</p>

        <title>Silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> does not alter <italic>Pst</italic> virulence phenotype</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of <italic>PsRan</italic> in rust pathogenicity, we silenced it by using the BSMV-mediated HIGS system. Two different fragments (PsRan-1as and PsRan-2as) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) were designed for specifically silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic>. Ten days after inoculation with BSMV, obvious photo bleaching was observed in BSMV:TaPDSas-inoculated plants that had the wheat phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene silenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), suggesting that the RNAi system is effective. The BSMV:00- (control), BSMV:PsRan-1as-, and BSMV:PsRan-2as-inoculated wheat plants were then inoculated with virulent <italic>Pst</italic> isolate CYR32, and their rust disease phenotypes were photographed at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) with <italic>Pst</italic>. Both BSMV:PsRan-1as- and BSMV:PsRan-2as-inoculated wheat plants showed similar disease phenotypes as control wheat plants, with equivalent amounts of uredinia as control wheat plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>,c). However, qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcript level of <italic>PsRan</italic> was significantly reduced in BSMV:PsRan-1as- and BSMV:PsRan-2as-inoculated wheat plants compared to that in control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), indicating <italic>PsRan</italic> was partially knocked down by the RNAi. These results suggest that silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> does not alter <italic>Pst</italic> virulence phenotype.</p>

        <title>Silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> impedes fungal growth of <italic>Pst</italic></title>
        <p>Despite of the unchanged virulence phenotype in PsRan-silenced wheat plants compared with control wheat plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), we performed a cytological analysis of these wheat plants to investigate whether fungal growth of <italic>Pst</italic> is affected after silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic>. The number of haustoria and the length of infection hyphae were evaluated in PsRan-silenced and control wheat plants at 18, 24, and 48 hpi with <italic>Pst</italic>. Both the number of haustoria and the length of infection hyphae were significantly reduced in PsRan-silenced wheat plants compared with control wheat plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5a</xref>,b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that fungal biomass was also significantly decreased in PsRan-silenced wheat plants compared with control wheat plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), which is consistent with the cytological analysis. These results indicate that silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> impedes fungal growth of <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

        <title>Heterologous overexpression of <italic>PsRan</italic> in plant suppresses cell death triggered by a mouse BAX gene or a <italic>Pst</italic> Ras gene</title>
        <p>Because there are some similarities between fungal cell death and cell death in other higher eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, we heterologously overexpressed <italic>PsRan</italic> in the model plant <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> to investigate the possible role of <italic>PsRan</italic> in cell death.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>As molecular switches in cellular signal transduction pathways, Ran proteins have been shown to regulate a variety of important cellular processes in many eukaryotes. However, little is known about Ran function in pathogenic fungi. In the present study, we report the identification and functional analysis of a Ran gene from the important plant fungal pathogen <italic>Pst</italic>, which provides significant insight into Ran function in pathogenic fungi.</p>
      <p>Only one Ran GTPase-encoding gene (<italic>PsRan</italic>) was identified in <italic>Pst</italic>. The same number of Ran-encoding gene is also observed in many other eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The PsRan protein contains all conserved domains of Ran GTPases and is localized to the nucleus as other known Ran proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, suggesting <italic>PsRan</italic> is a typical Ran gene. In addition, PsRan shares high (&gt;70%) identity with other Ran proteins from fungi, plants, and animals. Previous studies showed that overexpression of various Ran proteins from plants, similarly to their mammalian/yeast homologues, suppressed the phenotype of the pim46-1 cell cycle mutant in yeast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. These observations indicate that Ran proteins in different organisms also have functional similarity besides conserved sequences.</p>
      <p>qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcript level of <italic>PsRan</italic> was induced <italic>in planta</italic> during <italic>Pst</italic> infection, indicating <italic>PsRan</italic> may be important for plant infection of <italic>Pst</italic>. To investigate the specific role of <italic>PsRan</italic> in plant infection of <italic>Pst</italic>, we silenced <italic>PsRan</italic> using the BSMV-mediated HIGS system. The results showed that silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> significantly decreased the number of <italic>Pst</italic> haustoria and the length of <italic>Pst</italic> infection hyphae, demonstrating the involvement of PsRan in fungal growth. Because little is currently known about Ran function in pathogenic fungi, this study is the first investigating of the role of Ran proteins from pathogenic fungi in fungal growth. In addition, other four families (Ras, Rho, Rab, and Sar1/Arf) in small GTP-binding proteins are also proven to regulate fungal growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. These results highlight the great contribution of small GTP-binding proteins in fungal growth.</p>
      <p>Successful <italic>Pst</italic> infection of wheat plants appears as a mass of uredinia arranged in long and narrow stripes on leaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, PsRan-silenced wheat plants showed similar disease phenotypes as control wheat plants, with equivalent amounts of uredinia as control wheat plants, which indicate that silencing of <italic>PsRan</italic> did not alter <italic>Pst</italic> virulence phenotype. Silencing of many other rust genes from <italic>Pst</italic>, <italic>Pt</italic>, and <italic>Pgt</italic> also rarely changes their virulence phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. These results should not be taken as evidence that the majority of silenced genes are not involved in rust pathogenicity. The unchanged virulence phenotypes may be due to functional redundancy with other genes or that silencing was not sufficiently complete to knock down levels of encoded proteins to levels that would interfere with virulence phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p>
      <p>Some small GTP-binding proteins are proven to be important regulators of cell death in different organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, and cell death is involved in several important biological processes in pathogenic fungi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The possible roles of <italic>PsRan</italic> in cell death were investigated using heterologous systems because <italic>Pst</italic> lacks an efficient and reliable transformation system. Heterologous overexpression of <italic>PsRan</italic> in plant failed to induce cell death but suppressed cell death triggered by a mouse BAX gene or a <italic>Pst</italic> Ras gene, indicating that <italic>PsRan</italic> plays an important role in anti-cell death. Because there are some similarities between fungal cell death and cell death in other eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, our results suggest that PsRan may truly function in the cell death of <italic>Pst</italic>. In addition, Ran proteins are also proven to be involved in human cell death, but as a death-promoting member<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. These results indicate that Ran GTPases may function as positive or negative regulators of cell death in different organisms.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that <italic>PsRan</italic> is involved in fungal growth and anti-cell death. Future studies should be directed toward the investigation of the specific mechanisms of <italic>PsRan</italic> in fungal growth and anti-cell death, which will contribute to the control of the wheat stripe rust disease.</p>
