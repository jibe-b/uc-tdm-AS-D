        <p>The most common dwarfing genes in wheat, <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-D1b</italic>, classified as gibberellin-insensitive (GAI) dwarfing genes due to their reduced response to exogenous GA, have been verified as encoding negative regulators of gibberellin signaling. In contrast, the response of gibberellin-responsive (GAR) dwarfing genes, such as <italic>Rht12</italic>, to exogenous GA is still unclear and the role of them, if any, in GA biosynthesis or signaling is unknown. The responses of <italic>Rht12</italic> to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> were investigated on seedling vigour, spike phenological development, plant height and other agronomic traits, using F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> and F<sub>3&#x2236;4</sub> lines derived from a cross between Ningchun45 and Karcagi-12 in three experiments. The application of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> significantly increased coleoptile length and seedling leaf 1 length and area. While there was no significant difference between the dwarf and the tall lines at the seedling stage in the responsiveness to GA<sub>3</sub>, plant height was significantly increased, by 41 cm (53%) averaged across the three experiments, in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines. Plant height of the tall lines was not affected significantly by GA<sub>3</sub> treatment (&lt;10 cm increased). Plant biomass and seed size of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated dwarf lines was significantly increased compared with untreated dwarf plants while there was no such difference in the tall lines. GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants with the dominant <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> developed faster than untreated plants and reached double ridge stage 57 days, 11 days and 50 days earlier and finally flowered earlier by almost 7 days while the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated tall lines flowering only 1&#x2013;2 days earlier than the untreated tall lines. Thus, it is clear that exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> can break the masking effect of <italic>Rht12</italic> on <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> and also restore other characters of <italic>Rht12</italic> to normal. It suggested that <italic>Rht12</italic> mutants may be deficient in GA biosynthesis rather than in GA signal transduction like the GA-insensitive dwarfs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gibberellins (GAs) are a major class of plant hormones that regulate plant growth and development, from seed germination and stem elongation to fruit-set and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Hedden1">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Swain1">[4]</xref>. It is important for plants to produce and maintain optimal levels of bioactive GAs to ensure normal growth and development. Mutants with impaired GA biosynthesis or response show typical GA-deficient phenotypes, such as dark green leaves, dwarfism and late-flowering, while elevated exogenous GA dose or increased signaling can cause excessive plant growth and earlier flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Fleet1">[5]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Koornneef1">[8]</xref>. Mutants deficient in GA biosynthesis can be rescued by exogenously applied GAs but this is not possible if the mutation is in the GA signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Magome1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Koornneef1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The deployment of genes influencing plant height through the GA pathway was a major factor in the success of the Green Revolution, which created high-yielding cultivars of rice and wheat with shorter and sturdier culms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Khush1">[9]</xref>. In contrast to the recessive, semi-dwarf <italic>sd-1</italic> Green Revolution allele in rice, which is a loss-of-function mutation in one of the major GA biosynthetic genes (<italic>GA20ox2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Monna1">[10]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Spielmeyer1">[12]</xref>, the reduced height <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> (<italic>Rht1</italic>) and <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> (<italic>Rht2</italic>) Green Revolution alleles in wheat are semi-dominant gain-of-function mutations causing impaired GA signaling and thus conferring dwarfism through constitutive repression of cell division and elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Peng1">[13]</xref>. The wheat Green Revolution genes are orthologues of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GA-insensitive (<italic>gai</italic>), the rice slender1 (<italic>slr1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ikeda1">[14]</xref> or the rice <italic>gai</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ogawa1">[15]</xref>, the barley slender1 (<italic>sln1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chandler1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chandler2">[17]</xref> and the maize dwarf-8 (<italic>d8</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Peng1">[13]</xref> genes. However, in addition to reducing plant stature, <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> also reduce seedling vigour and coleoptile length, and may reduce crop water-use efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Allan1">[18]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Botwright1">[21]</xref> and performance in some unfavorable environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Rebetzke2">[22]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chapman1">[24]</xref>. So, opportunities exist for replacing <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> in wheat with alternative dwarfing genes, such as the GA-responsive dwarfing genes (<italic>Rht4</italic>, <italic>Rht5</italic>, <italic>Rht9</italic>, <italic>Rht12</italic>, <italic>Rht13</italic>, <italic>Rht14</italic>, <italic>Rht15, Rht16</italic> or <italic>Rht18</italic>). These genes have been reported to reduce plant height without compromising early plant growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. Even though there are several GA-responsive dwarfing genes in wheat, their molecular characteristics remain obscure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Gasperini1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Pearce1">[27]</xref> and the mechanisms by which they resulted in a reduction of plant height is not well understood. Fortunately, the metabolic pathways of gibberellin biosynthesis, deactivation and signaling have become relatively clear and many of the genes involved have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Hedden2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Yamaguchi1">[29]</xref>, which lays the foundation for analysis of GA-responsive dwarfing genes in wheat.</p>
      <p>Generally, dwarfing genes in wheat are classified into two categories, GA-responsive (GAR) and GA-insensitive (GAI), reflecting the relative magnitude of their responses to application of exogenous GAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Konzak1">[30]</xref>. GA-responsive dwarfing genes show significantly enhanced growth response to exogenous GAs (probably have mutations in GA biosynthesis pathway) while GA-insensitive dwarfing genes show very little response to exogenous GAs (probably have mutations in GA signaling pathway, such as <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-B1b</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. This classification has usually been conducted at the seedling stage, for example, based on the response of coleoptile length or the first seedling leaf elongation rate to exogenous GAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Konzak1">[30]</xref>. There is less information available on the response of the GAR dwarfing genes to exogenous GAs at later growth stages.</p>
      <p><italic>Rht12</italic>, a dominant dwarfing gene from the gamma ray-induced mutant Karcagi 522M7K of winter wheat (here referred to as Karkagi-12), has been classified as a GA-responsive dwarf gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Viglasi1">[31]</xref>. We have previously reported the effects of <italic>Rth12</italic> on wheat using a F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> population derived from a cross between Ningchun 45 (a tall spring wheat cultivar) and Karcagi-12 in two field experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref>. <italic>Rht12</italic> significantly decreased stem length (43%&#x223C;48% for peduncle) and leaf length (25%&#x223C;30% for flag leaf), while the thickness of the internode walls and width of the leaves were increased. Additionally, the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines showed very dark green leaves compared to tall lines. <italic>Rht12</italic> significantly decreased plant height, by around 40%, while seedling vigour, coleoptile length and root traits at the seedling stage were not affected adversely. <italic>Rht12</italic> lines had significantly increased floret fertility and grain number and achieved a higher harvest index (due to the lower plant biomass) than the tall genotypes. However, <italic>Rht12</italic> extended the duration of the spike development phase, especially the duration from sowing to double ridge, and delayed anthesis date by around 5 days. Even the dominant <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> allele could not compensate for these effects on phenological development, which may hamper the direct utilization of <italic>Rht12</italic> in wheat breeding. Another negative effect of <italic>Rht12</italic> on yield components was that grain size was reduced significantly. Similarly, other studies have found that <italic>Rht12</italic> had a substantial effect on reducing plant height without altering early vigour and significantly increased spikelet fertility, harvest index, and lodging resistance but these were usually accompanied by delayed ear emergence and reduced grain weight. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Viglasi1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Worland1">[33]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wojciechowski1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although <italic>Rht12</italic> has been classified as a GA-responsive dwarfing gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Worland1">[33]</xref>, a comprehensive understanding on the response of <italic>Rht12</italic> to exogenous GAs is lacking. Thus, the role of <italic>Rht12</italic>, if any, in GA biosynthesis or signaling is still unclear. Moreover, it has been recently found that the effects of the dwarfing gene <italic>Rht8</italic>, which had been considered as &#x2018;GA-responsive&#x2019;, was possibly not due to defective GA metabolism or signaling because the wild type and <italic>Rht8</italic> lines responded with a very similar increase in final plant height (15% and 13%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) with GA<sub>3</sub> application. It has been proposed that the effects of <italic>Rht8</italic> are possibly due to reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Gasperini1">[26]</xref>. So, can exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> restore the characters of <italic>Rht12</italic> (such as plant height, flowing time or seed size) to normal? Is there a significant difference between <italic>Rht12</italic> lines and the tall lines in GA<sub>3</sub>-responsiveness?</p>
      <p>To date none of the dwarfing genes have been cloned except a few GA-insensitive dwarf genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Pearce1">[27]</xref>. More information on these genes is needed for a better understanding of how the GAR dwarf genes act on plant growth and what their roles are in GA biosynthesis or signaling. The aim of this paper was to extend the work of Chen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref> by examining the response of <italic>Rht12</italic> to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> on plant development, agronomic traits and yield components and to investigate the possible role of <italic>Rht12</italic> in GA biosynthesis or signaling. The response to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> of <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf and tall lines were compared to determine if <italic>Rht12</italic> was responsive to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> during the whole life cycle of wheat and if <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines had a notably greater responsiveness to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> than tall lines.</p>

        <p>The presence or absence of the loci for <italic>Rht12</italic> and <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> in each F<sub>2</sub> individual was determined using the corresponding molecular markers (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref>). Individuals within the four groups of homozygous genotypes of <italic>Rht12Rht12Vrn-B1Vrn-B1</italic> (abbreviated as RRBB), <italic>Rht12Rht12vrn-B1vrn-B1</italic> (RRbb), <italic>rht12rht12Vrn-B1Vrn-B1</italic> (rrBB) and <italic>rht12rht12vrn-B1vrn-B1</italic> (rrbb) were then selected and used to develop the F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> and, subsequently, F<sub>3&#x2236;4</sub> lines for further analysis.</p>
        <p>The two parents and 24 random F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> homozygous lines (of a total of 57 homozygous lines identified) were used in the experiments to evaluate the effects of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> on <italic>Rht12</italic>. Among the F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> homozygous lines there were 7, 7, 5 and 5 lines with the genotypes <italic>RRBB</italic>, <italic>RRbb</italic>, rrBB, and rrbb, respectively. There were two sowing dates in 2011&#x2013;2012 growing season: October 6, 2011 (Autumn Sowing, AS) and February 6, 2012 (Spring Sowing, SS). In 2012&#x2013;2013 growing season, the 24 F<sub>3&#x2236;4</sub> lines were sown on October 6, 2012 (Autumn Sowing, AS). The lines and parents were sown in plots of four rows that were 2 m long and 25 cm apart, with seeds spaced 5 cm apart within rows. The parents and the 14 dwarf and 10 tall lines were randomly arranged to avoid competitive effects with two replications.</p>

        <title>Spike Development</title>
        <p>For the three experiments in the two years, spike development was significantly delayed and the duration of the spike development phase was extended in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines compared to that of tall lines. There was no significant difference between RRBB and RRbb groups in these effects. Compared to the tall lines with winter growth habit (rrbb), time to double ridge of the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines either with <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> or with <italic>vrn-B1</italic> was delayed by 16 days (45&#xB0;Cd), 5 days (89&#xB0;Cd) and 23 days (105&#xB0;Cd) in the three experiments respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the effect of the dominant vernalization gene <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> was masked in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines. In contrast, the tall lines without <italic>Rht12</italic> but with <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> (rrBB) reached double ridge about 64 days (30&#xB0;Cd), 4 days (57&#xB0;Cd) and 48 days (55&#xB0;Cd) earlier than those with <italic>vrn-B1</italic> (rrbb) in the three experiments, respectively, indicating that tall plants having dominant <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> needed less time to undergo vernalization. Application of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> significantly affected the progress of spike development and shortened the duration of the pre-anthesis phase in the dwarf lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t002">Table 2</xref>). It especially shortened the time to double ridge. The RRBB-GA lines (<italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines with <italic>Vrn-B1</italic>, with GA<sub>3</sub> application) showed 39 days (18&#xB0;Cd), 5 days (70&#xB0;Cd) and 24 days (25&#xB0;Cd) shorter SW-DR than the RRbb-GA lines (<italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines with <italic>vrn-B1</italic>, with GA<sub>3</sub> application) in the three experiments, respectively. It seemed that exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> relieved the epistatic effects of <italic>Rht12</italic> on <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> in the dwarf lines, such that RRBB-GA plants displayed a spring-like phenotype while RRbb-GA still showed a winter phenotype. Moreover, tall lines with GA<sub>3</sub> treatment also reached double ridge quicker, by about 2&#x2013;4 days than the untreated tall plants, though this effect was not as significant as in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t002">Table 2</xref>). The flowering of <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines was delayed by about 5&#x2013;8 days compared to tall lines while there was no significant difference between BB and bb lines in either year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines flowered earlier by almost 7 days compared to those without GA<sub>3</sub> treatment, while the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated tall lines flowered only 1&#x2013;2 days earlier than the tall lines without GA<sub>3</sub> treatment. It was therefore clear that GA<sub>3</sub> had a greater effect on spike development in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf genotypes than in the tall genotypes. Application of GA<sub>3</sub> broke the masking effect of <italic>Rht12</italic> on <italic>Vrn-B1</italic>, indicating either that <italic>Rht12</italic> lines had serious defects in the GA metabolic pathway or that exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> could in some other way compensate for the negative effects on plant development by <italic>Rht12</italic>.</p>

        <p>Due to a longer duration to double ridge, <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines developed more leaves than the equivalent tall genotypes. However, due to the shorter SW-DR of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants, less leaves were produced in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants than that in the untreated ones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t002">Table 2</xref>). Despite this, the number of elongated internodes was not changed. In this study, the dwarf parent Karcagi-12 generated the largest number of leaves in all experiments due to its longest duration of SW-DR while the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated Karcagi-12 had almost 4 leaves less than the untreated ones.</p>

        <p>The culm elongated faster in tall lines than in <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines from seedling stage, with the tall lines reaching jointing stage earlier and producing longer internodes and more biomass than the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086431-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This difference was sustained to maturity in both years. However, <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines achieved a higher resistance to lodging through shorter internode length and increased wall thickness without altering internode diameter compared with the tall lines. In particular, the lengths of the first and second internodes at the base of the stem, was significantly decreased in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines while their wall thickness was increased by 0.24 mm (31%) and 0.22 mm (34%) in the AS experiment, 0.23 mm (24%) and 0.23 mm (29%) in the SS experiment in the 2011&#x2013;2012 growing season and 0.13 mm (15%) and 0.17 mm (22%) in the 2012&#x2013;2013 growing season, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t003">Table 3</xref>). These shorter and thicker internodes might confer a greater resistance to lodging in the dwarf plants. However, after exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> application, the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants showed a faster stem elongation rate, similar to that of tall plants, compared with the untreated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086431-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The lengths of the first and second internodes at the base of the stem were significantly increased in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants compared with the untreated dwarf plants: by 4.1 cm (117%) and 6.9 cm (115%) in the AS experiment, 6.3 cm (252%) and 7.1 cm (131%) in the SS experiment of the 2011&#x2013;2012 growing season and 4.3 cm (165%) and 4.8 cm (87%) in the 2012&#x2013;2013 growing season, respectively. Also, the diameter and wall thickness of those internodes were significantly reduced in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines and thus these now &#x2018;tall&#x2019; GA<sub>3</sub> dwarf plants had serious lodging, as did the true tall lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t003">Table 3</xref>;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086431-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Treating <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants with exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> recovered the lost ability to produce long internodes and achieved a final plant height similar to that of the tall lines. Compared with the untreated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants, plant height was increased by 40 cm (49%), 45 cm (62%) and 37 cm (48%) in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated ones in the AS and SS experiments of 2011&#x2013;2012 and AS experiment of 2012&#x2013;2013, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086431-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, the internode characters and plant height of the tall lines were not affected significantly by GA<sub>3</sub> treatment (&#x223C;20% and &#x223C;10% increase in the length of the first and the second internode at the base of the stem, less than 10 cm (&lt;10%) increase in plant height), suggesting that the tall plants were not as sensitive as the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> due to the possible difference in the GA metabolic pathways of the two height categories or the tall lines were likely saturated at endogenous levels of GA. Despite this increase in response to application of endogenous GA, the plant height of the RR-GA lines remained lower than those of the tall lines.</p>

        <p>Spike length, number of spikelets per spike and number of florets initiated per spike were all decreased by <italic>Rht12</italic> compared with the tall lines. However, <italic>Rht12</italic> significantly increased the number of fertile florets per spike and achieved a higher fertility than the tall lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t004">Table 4</xref>). If the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines could maintain higher fertility and increase the number of florets initiated per spike after applying exogenous GA<sub>3</sub>, more grains would be produced resulting in increased yield. Unfortunately, in the AS experiments of both years, exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> increased spike length and also number of spikelets per spike in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086431-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) but the number of florets initiated per spike and fertile florets per spike were significantly decreased and the fertility was reduced compared with untreated dwarf ones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t004">Table 4</xref>). This lower fertility might have been due to there being less dry matter partitioned to spikes to support floret survival during the late reproductive phase as more available assimilates were transported to the larger vegetative organs in the now &#x2018;tall&#x2019; GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants. There was no significant difference on spike characters between the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated and untreated plants in the true tall lines though the number of florets initiated per spike was slightly reduced in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated tall plants.</p>

        <p>Possibly due to slower development of the vegetative phase (SW-DR), which shortened the period of time available under favorable conditions prior to flowering, the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines produced fewer (23%) fertile florets per spike than the tall lines in the SS experiment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref>). Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> accelerated plant development in dwarf lines and provided more time under favorable conditions to produce fertile florets in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants. The fertility of GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines was 21% higher than that of the untreated ones in the SS experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>

        <p>For the AS experiments in both years, grain numbers per spike were significantly increased whereas 1000-grain weight and plant biomass were significantly decreased in <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines compared to the tall lines. The increased grain numbers and the larger number of fertile ears per plant of the dwarf lines resulted in there being no significant difference in plant yield between the dwarf and tall lines. Additionally, since plant biomass was significantly decreased in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines, there was a net increase in harvest index (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t005">Table 5</xref>). Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> increased plant height of <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines as well as plant biomass but it reduced the number of fertile florets, which resulted in a lower grain number per spike and lower plant yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t005">Table 5</xref>). This was despite exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> increasing seed size in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086431-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The 1000-grain weight of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf plants was significantly increased, by 9.2 g (28%), 3.5 g (12%) and 6.5 g (18%), compared with untreated dwarf plants in the three experiments, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t005">Table 5</xref>). This indicated that GA<sub>3</sub> could partially compensate for the substantial negative effect of <italic>Rht12</italic> on yield components, although the increased 1000-grain weight of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines was still less than that of the tall lines. Additionally, the number of efficient spikes per plant and plant yield were decreased in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines compared with the untreated ones. Thus the harvest index of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines was significantly reduced, by 25% and 18% in the two AS experiments, compared with that of the untreated plants.</p>

        <p>In the SS experiment, the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines performed poorly for yield components due to their slow development rate. Grain number, 1000-grain weight, tiller number, plant biomass and plant yield of the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines were all lower than for the tall lines. GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines had a faster development rate and flowered earlier than the untreated ones, which contributed to achieving higher plant yield. Grain number, seed size, tiller number, plant biomass and plant yield were all increased in the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines compared with the untreated ones. Harvest index of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines was reduced due to the significantly increased plant height and biomass (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t005">Table 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>In all three experiments in the two years, plant biomass and height and 1000-grain weight of the GA<sub>3</sub>-treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines were all increased compared with the untreated ones. These traits of <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines showed a consistent response to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> application such that they performed like tall genotypes, indicating that the shorter plant stature and smaller seed size caused by <italic>Rht12</italic> was likely to be a result of a deficiency of endogenous GAs.</p>
        <p>Actually, GA<sub>3</sub> treatment like the dosage here were harmful to the tall genotype (which probably with sufficient GAs). Their endogenous hormone metabolic balance might be disturbed by the excess exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> application. As observed in this study, some variant genotypes were also founded in the GA<sub>3</sub> experiment, such as curling flag leaf, abnormal node shape and &#x201C;closed-flowered&#x201D; with stamens inside the hard glumes of variants. Some yield components of the GA<sub>3</sub> treated tall lines performed poorly than that of the untreated tall ones. For example, grain number, number of efficient spikes per plant and plant yield all reduced in the GA<sub>3</sub> treated tall lines though this decrease was not significant as that in the GA<sub>3</sub> treated <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines, whereas seed size was not changed significantly in the GA<sub>3</sub> treated tall lines compared with the untreated tall ones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t005">Table 5</xref>). GA<sub>3</sub> application resulted in lower yield for tall lines. This was associated with fewer grains per spike and fewer fertile spikes per plant. Plant biomass and HI were unchanged by application of GA<sub>3</sub> to tall lines.</p>

        <title>Effects of Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> on the Two Parents Karcagi-12 and Ningchun45</title>
        <p>Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> had similar effects on the dwarf parent Karcagi-12 as on the dwarf F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> and F<sub>3&#x2236;4</sub> genotypes described above. Plant height, plant biomass and seed size were significantly increased by GA<sub>3</sub> application while harvest index was decreased. In particular, plant height was increased by 70% compared with the untreated plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t006">Table 6</xref>). Plants of GA<sub>3</sub>-treated Karcagi-12 reached double ridge stage earlier than untreated plants, by 25 days (90&#xB0;Cd), 14 days (222&#xB0;Cd) and 32 days (200&#xB0;Cd) in the three experiments, respectively. However, exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> had smaller effects on the tall parent Ningchun45 compared with Karcagi-12 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086431-t006">Table 6</xref>). This difference between the two parents suggested that Karcagi-12 may need additional GAs to promote its development and to obtain a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; phenotype and that defects probably exist in GA metabolic pathways in Karcagi-12.</p>

      <p>This study is part of a series of experiments carried out to obtain a better understanding of the GA-responsive dwarfing gene <italic>Rht12</italic>. In the previous studies, the effects of <italic>Rht12</italic> on plant development and agronomic traits were analyzed comprehensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wojciechowski1">[35]</xref>. However, a clear understanding of the response of <italic>Rht12</italic> to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> is lacking. Moreover, the role, if any, of <italic>Rht12</italic> in GA biosynthesis or signalling or both remains unknown. Here, contrasting homozygous lines with or without <italic>Rht12</italic> and <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> genes (RRBB, RRbb, rrBB and rrbb) were selected in a F<sub>2</sub> segregating population and assessed as F<sub>2&#x2236;3</sub> and F<sub>3&#x2236;4</sub> lines to evaluate the response of <italic>Rht12</italic> to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that <italic>Rht12</italic> had no negative effects on seedling vigour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Rebetzke3">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Addisu1">[43]</xref>. Here we observed that there was no significant difference between dwarf and tall lines in area of the first seedling leaf or coleoptile length, in response to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub>. A similar result was reported by Ellis <italic>et al.</italic> (2004) who found that the maximum first leaf elongation rate (LER<sub>max</sub>) of <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines and their response to GA was not significantly different to the corresponding tall lines though the dwarf lines had a small but significant increase in LER<sub>max</sub> (&#x223C;23%) over the tall lines (&#x223C;37%) in the presence of GA. However, there was no notable difference on seedling vigour between the dwarf and the tall lines in either the presence or absence of GA. Thus, <italic>Rht12</italic> was classified as a late-acting dwarfing gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. Additionally, the GA-insensitive dwarfing genes, such as <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-D1b</italic>, which are characterized by a lack of GA response and verified to be involved in GA signaling, cause a significant reduction in seedling vigour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Peng1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Richards1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, another class of dwarfing genes (which includes <italic>Rht16</italic> and <italic>Rht18</italic>) had reduced seedling vigour compared with the corresponding tall lines while their relative GA response was significantly greater (50&#x223C;80%) than the tall lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. It was predicted that these <italic>Rht</italic> mutants were deficient in GA biosynthesis because the reduction in leaf elongation rate could (at least partially) be reversed by the application of GA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. Quantifying GA and its precursors in these mutants would test this hypothesis and could pinpoint the biochemical block leading to the reduction in GA. In fact, GA-responsive dwarf mutants identified in many species often result from mutations in genes encoding GA biosynthetic enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Hedden1">[1]</xref>. In particular, the major semi-dwarfing gene in rice (<italic>sd-1</italic>) has been shown to result from a deficiency in a late step of GA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Spielmeyer1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Even though <italic>Rht12</italic> had no effect on coleoptile length, the area of seedling leaf 1 or responsiveness to exogenous GA at the very early seedling stage, it was found that <italic>Rht12</italic> had a great effect on spike development, tillering, leaf and stem length (especially flag leaf length and peduncle length), harvest index and many other agronomic traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref>. In this study, the application of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> to <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines significantly shortened the duration to double ridge and promoted earlier flowing while reducing the number of emerged leaves. In particular, exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> broke the masking effect of <italic>Rht12</italic> on <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> such that the RRBB lines recovered to a nearly spring phenotype. In contrast, the tall lines had a much weaker response to exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> (&#x223C;3% for both rrBB and rrbb lines) than the dwarf lines (&#x223C;35% for RRBB lines and &#x223C;12% for RRbb lines) on the duration to double ridge. It seemed that additional GA was necessary to &#x2018;assist&#x2019; <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> promote spike development in the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines. It is not known whether any other development-promoting genes, like <italic>Vrn-A1</italic>, <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> or <italic>Ppd-B1</italic>, can compensate for the delay in spike development in <italic>Rht12</italic> lines. In addition to effects on phenological development, <italic>Rht12</italic> decreased internode length and final plant height (&#x223C;40%) in the absence of exogenous GA. However, the dwarf lines had a much greater response to the addition of GA<sub>3</sub> than the tall lines with an increase in plant height by about 50% while this was only 5% in the tall lines. It was clear that the major effect of <italic>Rht12</italic> on spike development and stem elongation could be overcome by GA treatment. This raises the possibility that the <italic>Rht12</italic> mutant is deficient in GA, at least late in development.</p>
      <p><italic>Rht12</italic> has been found to have significantly reduced grain size compared with other wheat dwarf genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Miralles1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Miralles2">[45]</xref>. The reason for this is still not clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Chen1">[32]</xref>. It may simply be due to the delayed flowering of <italic>Rht12</italic> lines into a more stressful period. Alternatively, the possible endogenous GA deficiency of the <italic>Rht12</italic> lines might be the main reason for producing smaller seeds. In this study, exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> significantly increased grain size, although this may have been because seed-set was decreased by GA<sub>3</sub> treatment. Wang et al (2001) found that the seed-set of the third floret was significantly reduced by GA<sub>3</sub> application though it did not affect seed-set of the first and second florets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wang1">[46]</xref>. This may not have been a direct effect of GA<sub>3</sub> application. Poor seed set at the third floret with GA<sub>3</sub> application may have been due to increased competition for assimilates from the strongly elongating stem. Lower grain number of the GA-treated lines might also contribute to the larger grain size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Flintham1">[47]</xref>, although there are many GA effects that could enhance grain size. For instance: GA application elongated both the lemma and palea of the florets especially in the third and fourth florets in the spikelet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wang1">[46]</xref> and may increase cell length in the pericarp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Keyes1">[48]</xref>; the increased size of vegetative organs may provide more assimilates available for producing large grains; induced early flowering may extend the period of time available with favorable conditions prior to harvest for grain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Worland1">[33]</xref>. However, the reduction in grain size of different dwarf genes may be through different modes of action from each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Allan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Rebetzke3">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Miralles2">[45]</xref> and further studies are needed to determine the possible relation between <italic>Rht</italic> genes and grain size as well as GA and grain size.</p>
      <p>Even though wheat dwarf genes have been studied for many years, only the GA-insensitive dwarf genes <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> have been cloned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Pearce1">[27]</xref>. However, there is still limited information on GA-responsive dwarf genes. <italic>Rht12</italic> is located on chromosome 5AL, linked to Xgwm291 by 5.4 cM. High-resolution mapping should be initiated for eventual map-based cloning of <italic>Rht12</italic>. Alternatively, due to the possibility that <italic>Rht12</italic> is involved in GA metabolic pathways, it would be instructive to use the quantitative RT-PCR strategy to investigate the expression patterns of the known GA metabolism genes (such as <italic>TaKAO</italic>, <italic>Ta20ox</italic>, <italic>Ta13ox</italic>, <italic>Ta3ox</italic> and <italic>Ta2ox</italic>) to look for potential candidate genes for <italic>Rht12</italic>. If the expression of a gene is significantly decreased or even non-expressed in the dwarf plant compared with that of the corresponding tall lines (transcript abundance probably correlated with plant height), this gene could be a candidate gene for sequence analysis. After alignment of sequences of the dwarf plant and the wild type or tall plants, the mutation site may be found in the gene. Indeed, there has been more information collected on genes involved in GA signal transduction than in GA biosynthesis related to wheat <italic>Rht</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Peng1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Pearce1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Appleford1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wilhelm1">[50]</xref>, though there have been many successful examples of GA biosynthesis variations correlated with dwarf phenotypes in Arabidopsis and rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Magome1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Sasaki1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Spielmeyer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Hu1">[51]</xref>. Thus, more information of the genes involved in GA biosynthesis in wheat is needed for a better understand of how these genes act on plant growth and result in dwarfism. On the other hand, the manipulation of GA biosynthesis or perception may be a good target for regulating crop height <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Appleford1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Appleford2">[52]</xref>. However, it is clear that analysis of the endogenous GAs in <italic>Rht12</italic> mutant is a priority.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the <italic>Rht12</italic> dwarf lines grown in this study showed compact and dark green leaves, dwarfism and a late-flowering phenotype compared with the tall lines. All of these are typical features of GA-deficient mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Koornneef1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Appleford2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wen1">[53]</xref>. Moreover, these effects could be rescued by exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> treatment, suggesting that this possible defect/mutation was not involved in GA signal transduction like the GA-insensitive dwarfs, but probably in the GA biosynthesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ogawa1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Wen1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Sun1">[54]</xref>. This study also confirms that reduced plant height could be dissociated from any effects on the early stage of growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>. <italic>Rht12</italic> caused a strong form of dwarfism and yet had no effect on coleoptiles length or seedling leaf growth. This type of late-acting dwarf gene in wheat therefore offers the opportunity to reduce plant stature without compromising on early growth and crop establishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Ellis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086431-Rebetzke4">[55]</xref>. Since <italic>Rht12</italic> lines posses this feature, it is probable that they do not have a deficiency in GA at the early seedling stage. Why this changes later in development is an interesting question.</p>
