          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Rust diseases are of major importance in wheat production worldwide. With the constant evolution of new rust strains and their adaptation to higher temperatures, consistent and durable disease resistance is a key challenge. Environmental conditions affect resistance gene performance, but the basis for this is poorly understood.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Here we show that a change in day temperature affects wheat resistance to <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), the causal agent of yellow (or stripe) rust. Using adult plants of near-isogenic lines UC1041 +/- <italic>Yr36</italic>, there was no significant difference between <italic>Pst</italic> percentage uredia coverage in plants grown at day temperatures of 18&#xB0;C or 25&#xB0;C in adult UC1041&#x2009;+&#x2009;<italic>Yr36</italic> plants. However, when plants were transferred to the lower day temperature at the time of <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation, infection increased up to two fold. Interestingly, this response was independent of <italic>Yr36</italic>, which has previously been reported as a temperature-responsive resistance gene as <italic>Pst</italic> development in adult UC1041 <italic>-Yr36</italic> plants was similarly affected by the plants experiencing a temperature reduction. In addition, UC1041 <italic>-Yr36</italic> plants grown at the lower temperature then transferred to the higher temperature were effectively resistant and a temperature change in either direction was shown to affect <italic>Pst</italic> development up to 8&#xA0;days prior to inoculation. Results for seedlings were similar, but more variable compared to adult plants. Enhanced resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> was observed in seedlings of UC1041 and the cultivar Shamrock when transferred to the higher temperature. Resistance was not affected in seedlings of cultivar Solstice by a temperature change in either direction.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p><italic>Yr36</italic> is effective at 18&#xB0;C, refining the lower range of temperature at which resistance against <italic>Pst</italic> is conferred compared to previous studies. Results reveal previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity in the UC1041 background which is caused by a change in temperature and independently of <italic>Yr36</italic>. This novel phenotype is present in some cultivars but absent in others, suggesting that <italic>Pst</italic> defence may be more stable in some cultivars than others when plants are exposed to varying temperatures.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Rusts are among the most economically important and widespread diseases of wheat worldwide. Yellow (or stripe) rust, caused by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), is predominantly found in temperate regions and propagates mainly through asexual urediniospores produced in uredia on the leaf surface. <italic>Pst</italic> is becoming more prevalent, possibly due to the evolution of more aggressive isolates which have evolved to tolerate higher temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In parallel, several major sources of wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> have broken down in recent years. These developments hasten the need to identify more effective and durable sources of resistance.</p>
      <p><italic>Pst</italic> urediniospores germinate on the wheat leaf surface, forming a germ tube that enters the plant through stomata. Once inside, a sub-stomatal vesicle (SSV) is formed within the stomatal cavity from which infection hyphae form. A haustorial mother cell is formed at the end of each infection hypha upon contact with a plant mesophyll cell. An infection peg breaches the plant cell wall forming a fungal feeding structure, known as a haustorium, within the cell. Further hyphae develop from the infection hyphae and proliferate throughout the leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Approximately two weeks after the pathogen has entered the plant, visible symptoms can be seen in susceptible reactions as raised pustules, known as uredia forming on the leaf surface.</p>
      <p>The effect of temperature on the performance of resistance genes is well-documented. Several quantitative disease resistance (QDR) genes, conferring enhanced resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> at either high or low temperatures, have been identified in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. QDR is often described as adult plant or partial resistance, or as &#x2018;slow rusting&#x2019;. The effect of temperature on yellow rust resistance genes is well-known (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). Seedlings of wheat cultivars with high temperature adult plant (HTAP) resistance are susceptible to all races of <italic>Pst</italic> at high and low temperatures. Adult plants of HTAP resistance cultivars are susceptible at low temperatures, but resistant at high temperatures. Yellow rust resistance genes <italic>Yr36</italic> and <italic>Yr39</italic> were originally designated as HTAP genes because exposure to higher temperatures was essential for their function at later plant growth stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, <italic>Yr36</italic> was later shown to confer temperature-dependent resistance at all growth stages when exposed to temperatures over 25&#xB0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast to HTAP genes, leaf rust resistance conferred by <italic>Lr34/Yr18</italic> is enhanced at lower temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>Lr34</italic>/<italic>Yr18</italic> is a well-established resistance, being present in many wheat cultivars and occupying more than 26 million hectares in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], whereas <italic>Yr36</italic> has more recently been introduced into many varieties worldwide through the introgression of the closely linked <italic>Gpc-B1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, several wheat cultivars have been identified as containing un-characterised yellow rust temperature&#x2013;responsive resistance genes, suggesting that such genes are widely deployed in agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>Plants have several layers of defence that provide protection against invading microbes. Plants recognise conserved microbial elicitors, known as pathogen (or microbe)-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs), through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), initiating PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). PTI activates inducible defences, including cell wall reinforcement, production of antimicrobial compounds and stomatal closure which are sufficient to repel or deter most invading microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Virulent pathogens have evolved to suppress PTI, producing effector proteins that interfere with PRR function or downstream signalling components. Another layer of defence is provided by resistance (R) proteins that detect these effector proteins initiating effector-triggered immunity (ETI), a type of resistance typified by the hypersensitive response (HR) associated with host cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Most R genes are predicted to encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains involved in effector recognition. However, cloning of the QDR genes <italic>Yr36</italic> and <italic>Lr34</italic> has revealed that these genes do not belong to the major NBR-LRR class of genes, suggesting that the mechanisms of resistances conferred by these genes could be fundamentally different from those of R genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>At present, the basis for temperature-responsive resistance is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study, we investigate temperature-sensitivity in the wheat-yellow rust pathosystem using near isogenic lines (NILs) of the hexaploid wheat breeding line UC1041 <italic>+/- Yr36</italic>. Plants were grown under two temperature regimes which were maintained at 12&#xB0;C during the dark period and 18&#xB0;C or 25&#xB0;C during the light period (hereby referred to as 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C or 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C). After inoculation, plants were either kept at the original temperatures they were grown under or transferred to the other temperature regime. Our findings reveal previously uncharacterised background sensitivity to temperature changes in UC1041 that acts independently of <italic>Yr36</italic>. Defence against <italic>Pst</italic> in adult UC1041-<italic>Yr36</italic> was affected by a temperature change in both directions and this effect was consistent in plants transferred up to 8&#xA0;days prior to inoculation. Enhanced resistance when plants experienced an increase in temperature was observed in seedlings, and manifested as reduced hyphal colonisation compared to seedlings maintained at cooler day temperatures. We also show that this temperature sensitivity is genotype-dependent in wheat seedlings. Our work highlights the importance of temperature changes, rather than defined thresholds, when characterising disease resistance mechanisms in wheat. The results have potential to inform breeding strategies for the creation of wheat cultivars with more environmentally stable <italic>Pst</italic> resistance.</p>

        <title>A decrease in day temperature diminishes resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> independently of <italic>Yr36</italic></title>
        <p><italic>Yr36</italic> conferred near-complete resistance in adult plants of UC1041&#x2009;<italic>+&#x2009;Yr36</italic> when plants were maintained in either the 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C or the 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C temperature regimes pre and post inoculation. However, <italic>Yr36</italic>-mediated resistance was significantly reduced in plants originally grown at 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C and then transferred, post-inoculation to 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C, uredia coverage being significantly higher (<italic>P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01</italic>, Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,B). As expected, UC1041 <italic>-Yr36</italic> plants were less resistant than UC1041&#x2009;<italic>+&#x2009;Yr36</italic>, and there were no significant differences in disease levels between plants which were maintained at 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C or 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C pre and post-inoculation (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,B). However, resistance in UC1041 <italic>&#x2013;Yr36</italic> was also significantly reduced when adult plants were transferred from the 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C to 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C regime following inoculation, with leaf uredia coverage increasing up to two fold (<italic>P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01</italic>). Changing temperatures therefore affects resistance in both UC1041 NILs independent of the presence of <italic>Yr36</italic>.</p>

        <title>A change in temperature affects <italic>Pst</italic> resistance up to 8&#xA0;days pre-inoculation in UC1041</title>
        <p>Initial observations with the UC1041 +/-<italic>Yr36</italic> NILs led us to further characterise the temperature-responsive <italic>Pst</italic> resistance of the UC1041 background. As previously observed, there was no significant difference in percentage uredia coverage of plants maintained pre and post inoculation at 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C or 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B), whilst plants transferred from the higher to the lower temperature regime were less resistant (<italic>P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01</italic>). Conversely, plants grown at 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C and then transferred to 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C post inoculation were more resistant, with significantly lower uredia levels (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). The extent of <italic>Pst</italic> colonisation varied between each of the three experiments, although similar amounts of spores were applied. Nevertheless, the trend in adult UC1041 -<italic>Yr36</italic> plants remained consistent in each experiment, with temperature decreases diminishing resistance and temperature increases resulting in enhanced resistance. UC1041 resistance can respond differently at 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C and 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C. At 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C the uredia are surrounded by necrotic tissue (dead cells), indicative of a cell death/hypersensitive response (HR). The uredia are often surrounded by chlorotic tissue, the HR being weak. The shift from 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C to 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C may trigger a cell death response and result in a retardation of uredia formation.</p>

        <title>A decrease in day temperature affects later stages of <italic>Pst</italic> colonisation in UC1041 seedlings</title>
        <p>Further investigations were performed on seedlings to determine whether the temperature-change effects were influenced by the developmental stage of the host. No <italic>Pst</italic> resistance was observed in seedlings of UC1041 <italic>&#x2013;Yr36</italic> infected with isolate 08/21, resulting in higher levels of <italic>Pst</italic> uredia than seen on adult plants. As in adult UC1041 plants, there were no significant differences in disease levels between plants which were maintained at either 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C or 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C pre and post-inoculation (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). As in adult plants, enhanced resistance was observed when seedlings were transferred from 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C to12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C (<italic>P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001</italic>, Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). However, there was no significant difference in uredia levels between plants maintained at 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C and plants transferred from 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C to 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C after <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation, contrary to the reduced resistance observed in adults plants.</p>

        <title>Effect of temperature change on <italic>Pst</italic> resistance in wheat cultivars is genotype-dependent</title>
        <p>To determine whether temperature changes induce resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> in other wheat cultivars the same experimental procedures were carried out on seedlings of selected UK elite cultivars. Resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> isolate 08/21 in Shamrock displayed a similar phenotype to UC1041, with seedlings that were transferred from lower to higher temperatures displaying a significant reduction in uredia levels (<italic>P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05</italic>, Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). However, resistance in Solstice was not affected by transferring between temperature regimes, as disease levels did not differ significantly between all four treatments (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). As in UC1041 seedlings, resistance enhancement in Shamrock was not consistent. When seedlings were transferred from 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C to 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C enhanced resistance was observed in 3 out of 4 experiments.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our investigations show that <italic>Yr36</italic> confers almost complete resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> isolate 08/21 at 25&#xB0;C, consistent with previous studies. We also show that <italic>Yr36</italic> is effective at 18&#xB0;C, refining the lower range of temperature at which resistance is conferred. In addition, we discovered that the UC1041 genetic background responds to changes in temperature independently of <italic>Yr36,</italic> affecting growth of <italic>Pst.</italic> Our results suggest that <italic>Yr36</italic>-mediated resistance may be affected by a previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity which is present in the UC1041background. In the field, <italic>Yr36</italic> conveys a QDR phenotype on adult plants when grown in Mediterranean environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Based on the results presented here, frequent temperature changes could be influencing the QDR observed for UC1041&#x2009;+&#x2009;<italic>Yr36</italic> in the field. Furthermore, our results also suggest that <italic>Yr36</italic>-mediated resistance should be effective in the field under relatively cooler temperate conditions.</p>
      <p>Several studies characterising temperature-responsive resistance genes have been performed using different pre and post inoculation conditions, but the effect of temperature change has rarely been considered. Yet under natural conditions, temperatures are constantly changing and the effect of this on resistance needs further investigation. It is possible that other temperature-responsive resistance genes may respond to changes in temperature in a similar way to that seen in UC1041 +/- <italic>Yr36</italic>, rather than only requiring exposure to a temperature threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For example, a study by Broers and Wallenburg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] observed that a decrease in temperature increases <italic>Lr34/Yr18</italic> resistance to leaf rust, although in this study there was no negative control treatment involving plants not exposed to the temperature change. Pretorius <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] later point out that the Broers and Wallenburg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] study does not exclude background effects from the cultivars in which the <italic>Lr34/Yr18</italic> gene resided. Our findings highlight the importance of a change in temperature regime in pathology studies and especially when characterising temperature-responsive resistance genes.</p>
      <p>Adult plant tests are the most appropriate methods for evaluating resistance, but limit the number experiments that can be performed. Although seedling tests enable more rapid screening and testing of resistance, our results reveal that results are less reliable than with adult plants. Studies with UC1041 seedlings revealed that a temperature increase can enhance resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> at an early stage of plant development. Although the results are less consistent than those observed in adult plants, the results suggest that the effect of temperature changes may not be only due to previously uncharacterised APR resistance in the UC1041 background. Also in seedlings, a decrease in temperature does not reduce resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> as seen in adult plants of UC1041 (40% infection), but this could be due to the higher levels of <italic>Pst</italic> infection seen on UC1041 seedlings (approximately 90% infection). Differences between adult plants and seedlings could be caused by <italic>Pst</italic> inoculum levels, or reflect physiological differences influencing defence, considering some types of resistance cannot be detected until later developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As in UC1041, the enhanced resistance observed in Shamrock was not seen in all seedling experiments. When the phenotype was not observed, uredia abundance was higher in both cultivars compared to experiments where a temperature effect was observed. This suggests that high levels of <italic>Pst</italic> inoculum and subsequent heavy infection loads may mask the effect of the temperature change.</p>
      <p>We show that <italic>Pst</italic> is able to germinate and penetrate the plant successfully, regardless of the temperature-regime to which the plants have been exposed. This would suggest that the temperature-responsive resistance does not involve a mechanism dependent on the initial recognition of the pathogen. The phenotype observed when UC1041 and Shamrock plants were transferred from 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C to 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C resembles a type of QDR normally associated with decreased infection frequency, increased latency period, and reduced uredium size which generally only show signs of infection later in the growing season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Some aspects of this phenotype are seen with HTAP yellow rust resistance, which is a QDR generally effective after stem elongation and when day temperatures are 25&#xB0;C &#x2013;30&#xB0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the enhanced adult plant yellow rust resistance we observed was induced by an increase in temperature rather than prolonged exposure to 25&#xB0;C, and was also observed in seedlings. Our results therefore suggest that temperature changes, rather than exposure to a threshold temperature, could be influencing some QDR mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Plants must continuously adapt to changing environments, and balance resources between growth and defence to achieve maximum productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Studies in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> suggest a general trade-off mechanism whereby hormone-mediated growth may antagonise immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Consequently, temperature changes may trigger reorganisation of energy supplies in some wheat cultivars, indirectly resulting in reduced nutrient availability to <italic>Pst</italic>, a biotrophic fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Another possibility is that temperature changes could lead to the accumulation of pathogen-deterring metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although QDR mechanisms are largely unknown, <italic>Lr34</italic> and <italic>Yr36</italic> do not fall into the general NBS-LRR class of R genes, so it is reasonable to hypothesise that these are not generally involved in pathogen recognition. Some QDR genes may have other functions that indirectly affect pathogen development when exposed to changes in temperature.</p>
      <p>Our results show that a change in temperature up to 8&#xA0;days before inoculation affected defence against <italic>Pst</italic> in UC1041 adult plants. Thus, pre-exposure to a different temperature regime affects subsequent defence, which suggests an adaptive response. We have no evidence that the temperature change is resulting in a stress response, but the lasting effect of increased or decreased resistance is comparable to priming, whereby previous exposure of plants to stress enables a faster response to subsequent stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Ambient temperature changes, similar to the ones used in this study, have been shown to cause adaptive change through epigenetic modification of DNA activity by methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that the corresponding temperature changes in wheat could also epigenetically prime plants, affecting later stages of defence, as seen in UC1041.</p>
      <p>Seedlings of Shamrock demonstrated a similar resistance phenotype to UC1041 when transferred to a higher temperature post-inoculation. However, resistance in Solstice seedlings was not affected by a temperature change in either direction, indicating that the response is genotype-dependent and that some cultivars may have more stable defence against <italic>Pst</italic> than others under varying temperatures. Park <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] support these observations, reporting differences between wheat cultivars when challenged with <italic>Pst</italic> at different pre and post inoculation temperature regimes. The authors attributed enhanced resistance at higher temperatures to factors that control adult plant resistance, such as uncharacterised QDR genes being present in the cultivars used in their study. If the basis for our observations is host adaptation to temperature changes, then other pathogen interactions may also be affected. A significant difference in resistance to changing temperatures was observed between wheat cultivars in response to <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp <italic>tritici</italic>, the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew, indicating that the phenomenon may not be restricted to yellow rust resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Understanding the effects of temperature changes on plant defence will be essential for developing crops that are more resilient to the potential impacts of climate change. Consistent crop performance and reliable disease resistance are important traits in plant breeding. Our results suggest an experimental approach to study the resistance response to changes in temperature. Further investigation will reveal whether this trait interacts with other resistances, and if it can be used to select wheat cultivars with more consistent, temperature-stable resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> and other diseases.</p>

      <p><italic>Yr36</italic> can prevent <italic>Pst</italic> pustule development at temperatures sustained below 25&#xB0;C which is contrary to what has previously been shown. In addition, a previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity was discovered in the UC1041 background, revealing that changes in temperature can affect subsequent wheat resistance to yellow rust and may do so in a cultivar dependent manner.

        <p>Seeds were sown directly into 1 litre pots and grown to the emergence of the first flag leaf (Zadok&#x2019;s Growth Stage (GS) 47), or in P15 seed trays for seedling (Zadok&#x2019;s GS 13-14) assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Plants were grown in controlled environment rooms (CERs) with an 8&#xA0;hr/16&#xA0;hr dark/light cycle, a constant 80% relative humidity and a light intensity of approximately 350&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol&#xA0;m<sup>-2</sup>&#xA0;s<sup>-1</sup>. The two diurnal temperature regimes were 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C and 12&#xB0;C/25&#xB0;C, night/day temperatures (day temperature being the only difference between treatments). To synchronise growth stage, plants were grown one week earlier in the 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C regime. For assays on wheat seedlings, plants were sown one to two days earlier in the 12&#xB0;C/18&#xB0;C regime, depending on the cultivar.</p>

        <title>Yellow rust inoculations of wheat plants</title>
        <p>Inoculations were carried out on flag leaves of adult plants and the newest fully-expanded leaf of seedlings. Plants were inoculated with <italic>Pst</italic> urediniospores exactly 1&#xA0;hour before the end of the light period. A 4&#xA0;cm (seedlings) or 5&#xA0;cm (adult plants) region of the adaxial surface of the leaf was defined and urediniospores were applied with a fine brush as a 1:8 (seedlings) or 1:4 spore/talc mixture (adult plants). The leaf surface was then sprayed with H<sub>2</sub>O containing Tween20 &#xAE; (0.01%&#xA0;v/v) to encourage germination. In the UC1041 +/- <italic>Yr36</italic> NIL comparison experiments the same procedure was used to apply urediniospores, but whole leaves were inoculated. In all experiments with the UC1041 <italic>&#x2013;Yr36</italic> line only, plants were inoculated in a defined area. Plants were then placed in a dew chamber at 12&#xB0;C, in total darkness for 22&#xA0;hrs before being returned either to the original temperature regime, or transferred to the new regime. At 18&#xA0;days post inoculation (dpi) the same 4-5&#xA0;cm region (or the whole leaf for UC1041 NIL comparisons) was used to determine Percentage infection (Pi), measured as the percentage of leaf tissue (independent of chlorosis or necrosis) covered with sporulating uredia.</p>

For removal of chlorophyll, samples were left to clear overnight in 12&#xA0;ml of 1&#xA0;M KOH with 2&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of Tween20 &#xAE; at 37&#xB0;C. The tissue was rinsed three times in 50&#xA0;mM Tris at pH&#xA0;7.5, followed by staining with WGA-FITC at 1&#xA0;mg/ml in 50&#xA0;mM Tris for 1&#xA0;hr. The tissue was mounted on a slide and observed under fluorescent light (465-495&#xA0;nm&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;515-555&#xA0;nm) using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 800 Eclipse; Nikon Precision Europe GmbH, Langen, Germany). Samples from early time points were examined for both urediniospore germination and the ability of germinated urediniospores to form sub-stomatal vesicles (SSVs). Later time points were scored by measuring the size of internal fungal structures (&#x3BC;m) and abundance of hyphae in up to 50 fields of view at 10&#xD7; magnification.</p>
