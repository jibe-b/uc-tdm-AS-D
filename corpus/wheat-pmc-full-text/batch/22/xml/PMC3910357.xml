      <abstract>
        <p>To investigate the lignifications process and its physiological significance under Karnal Bunt (KB), the changes in enzymes 
responsible for lignifications likes, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), were determined in resistant (HD-29) and susceptible 
genotype (WH-542) of wheat during different developmental stages. The PAL gene was cloned and sequenced. The expression of 
PAL gene was measured by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The enzyme was expressed constitutively in both the susceptible 
and resistant genotype. However, the activity was higher in all the developmental stages of resistant genotype, indicating that this 
genotype has a significant higher basal level of these enzymes as compared to the susceptible line and could be used as marker(s) 
to define KB resistance. The activity of PAL was significantly higher in WSv stage (Z=16). Structural comparisons based on 
alignments of all the protein sequences using the clustal W program and searches for conserved motifs using the MEME program 
have revealed broad conservation of main motifs characteristic of the plant PAL. MSA and phylogenetic analyses of different plants 
PAL demonstrate that all PAL cluster divided in to two main cluster. The PAL also possesses a specific consensus sequences [GS]-
[STG]-[LIVM]-[STG]-[SAC]-S-G-[DH]-L-x-[PN]-L-[SA]-x(2,3)-[SAGVTL]. The pathway might be associated with the enhancement 
of structural defense barrier due to lignifications of cell wall as evident from the enhanced synthesis of lignin in all the stages of 
resistant genotype. Our results clearly indicate the possible role of enzymes of Phenyl propanoid pathway metabolism provides 
genotype and stage dependant structural barrier resistance in wheat against KB.

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The lignifications (a phenolic compound lignin), is a well 
known plant response to fungal attack. Lignin deposition is 
correlated with an increased activity enzyme from 
phenylpropanoid pathway. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 
(PAL; EC 4.3.1.5) catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of 
phenylpropanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]. PAL enzyme a member of the 
ammonia lyase family that catalyzes a reaction converting L 
phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid. It has 
a molecular mass in the range of 270-330 kDa.</p>
      <p>Phenylpropanoids are essential for growth, development, 
and survival of vascular plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>]. The activity 
of PAL is induced dramatically in response to various stimuli such as tissue 
wounding, pathogenic attack, light, low temperatures, and hormones 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. PAL is the first and committed 
step in the phenyl propanoid pathway and is therefore involved in the biosynthesis 
of the polyphenol compounds (such as flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and 
lignin in plants) through general phenylpropanoid metabolism involves a 
sequence of enzyme-regulated reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Karnal bunt (KB) caused by <italic>Tilletia indica</italic> (Syn. <italic>Neovossia indica</italic>), 
a semi-biotroph fungus. It is a seed borne disease which 
typically causes partial conversion of individual kernels into 
sori filled with fetid teliospores thus affecting yield and quality 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>]. 
The pathogen affects wheat spikes and proliferates within 
seeds, leading to the impairment of grain quality, seed vigor 
and reduction in market acceptability of the product. Since the 
pathogen disseminates through seeds, it also necessitates 
quarantine regulations to restrict the spread of the disease to 
unaffected areas. Elucidation of the Molecular basis of 
resistance and stage specific immunity against KB is needed to 
be examined for analyzing the role of enzymes of 
phenylpropanoid metabolism which provides structural 
barriers in conferring the resistance against KB in wheat. Fungi, 
which are serious plant pathogens, are known to cause serious 
yield losses in economically important agricultural crops. 
Recombinant DNA based approach could be utilized to develop 
fungal resistant crop varieties, provided that the cellular and 
molecular basis of fungal phyto-pathogenesis is delineated. In 
the present study attempts were made to elucidate possible role 
of PAL in impart stage specific and differential immunity as 
well as their role in providing structural barrier against KB 
pathogen has been demonstrated by comparing the basal levels 
of enzyme activity that are involved in tissue lignifications in 
developing wheat spikes and <italic>in silico</italic> characterization of PAL

        <p>Total RNA was isolated from immature spike lets of wheat 
genotypes HD-29 and WH- 542, PAL were amplified using the 
same PCR conditions in both resistant and susceptible 
genotype. The primer sets designed from highly conserved 
domains were efficient in reproducible amplification of 
expected sizes 1.5 kb of amplicons. Amplification of PAL gene 
gave product size of 1500 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The sequence was 
submitted to NCBI databank and is available online at NCBI 
website. Stage dependent co-amplification of the PAL and actin 
mRNA transcripts expression was studied in both the 
genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and 
Densitometry (relative values) clearly showed PAL mRNA 
transcripts were significantly higher (P\0.001) in resistant 
genotype compared to susceptible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a&#x2013;b</xref>). In HD29, PAL 
gene expression utmost at Sv stage, its expression gradually 
drop off upto S3 stage (slight grain formation) in resistant 
genotype. The PAL gene was maximally expressed at Sv-stage 
(P/0.001) of wheat spike (i.e., vegetative leaf stages) 
accumulates high level of lignin and phytoalexin and then 
degree of expression was declined gradually. In susceptible 
genotype PAL mRNAs express in all the stages although the 
intensity of each amplicon was much lower than that of 
resistance genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a&#x2013;b</xref>). However, these results 
indicate that higher expression of PAL seemed to impart 
resistance against KB. However, this work provides possible 
evidences in favor of the role of PAL in defining the KB 
resistance. The expression of PAL occurring from Sv to S2 
stages a highly prone stage to KB infection, and the intensity of 
the detected bands in RT PCR, showed that PAL seemed to be 
expressed more in resistant than in susceptible genotype. 
Interestingly, expression and localization of <italic>pal mRNA</italic> was 
observed in Sv tissue, suggesting their involvement in 
flavonoid biosynthesis as well (Mahroug <italic>et al</italic>., 2005). Increased

Motif 14 absent all the monocotyledon plants. Motifs 3, 9, 15, 18 absent 
only in <italic>Triticum species like T. aestivum</italic> and <italic>T. ururtus</italic>. Motif 12 absent 
in <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>. Motif 6 occurs twice in monocotyledon while only once 
found in dicotyledon plants. Duplication or absence of Motifs are either, 
substitution, accumulation of mutation or subjected to rearrangements. 
It is not necessary that changes their activity, because that do not have 
a direct impact on the active site contain altered residues. Duplication 
events have been an important theme in the evolution of the PAL gene family. 
At least five distinct duplication events can be identified in the PAL gene 
tree, with the oldest event following the divergence of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>. 
Duplication events in the ancestral lineage, as well at the tip of the 
gymnosperm branch, suggest potential sources of functional variability

        <p>Prediction of putative protein variability sites was performed

database individually by calculating Shannon entropy (H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. 
In monocotyledon plants shows low variability level (H&gt;2) 
when compared to clones <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). In 
monocotyledons plants sequence N terminal and intermediate 
sequences shows highly conserved sequence H&lt;1, some 
intermediate sequence shows conserve sequence H&lt;2. Protein 
variability is very high towards the N terminal in dicotyledon 
plants as the Shannon entropy H &gt;2.0 compared to &#x2018;C&#x2019; terminal. 
Sequence from amino acids 30 to 200 shows highly conserver as 
H&lt;1 while intermediate sequence shows H&lt; 2 that is conserved 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Conserved regions with in monocotyledons and 
dicotyledons PAL proteins regions between 220-244, 275-299,

supplementary material). Shannon entropy result shows 
variability was found to be more at dicotyledons protein 
compared to monocotyledons plants. It indicates that during 
evolution rate of mutation is very high compared to

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Phenylalanine ammonia lyase, is a primary control point for the 
phenylpropanoid pathway which belongs to the lyase class I 
super-family of enzymes. This study is the most extensive stage 
specific molecular expression and in silico phylogenomic 
studies so far for the PAL gene, particularly with respect to 
karnal bunt resistant (HD 29) and susceptible (WH 542) 
genotype of <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>. The partial sequence of cloned 
PAL genes available in the GenBank. Differential expression 
patterns of RT PCR suggest that the PAL gene products may be 
responsible for providing biosynthetic precursors to different 
phenylpropanoid branch pathways under different 
developmental conditions or in response to various external 
stimuli. The PAL transcript was particularly abundant in 
developing spikes. The phylogenetic tree constructed using 
PAL gene sequences from 24 species including dicotyledonous 
and monocotyledon shows a 70 % homology between them, 
which may suggest different functional regulation. The lignin 
content of higher plants has long been recognized as an 
important factor in the resistance response against potential
pathogens. However, induced lignifications have been 
proposed as an important mechanism of disease resistance of 
wheat against a variety of fungal pathogens. Several lines of 
evidence point to a role for cellular lignification in the 
hypersensitive resistance response of wheat to the karnal bunt 
fungus, <italic>Tilletia indica</italic>.</p>
