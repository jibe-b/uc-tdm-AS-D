      <abstract>
        <p>Heat shock factors (Hsfs) play a central regulatory role in acquired thermotolerance. To understand the role of the major molecular players in wheat adaptation to heat stress, the Hsf family was investigated in <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses identified 56 TaHsf members, which are classified into A, B, and C classes. Many TaHsfs were constitutively expressed. Subclass A6 members were predominantly expressed in the endosperm under non-stress conditions. Upon heat stress, the transcript levels of A2 and A6 members became the dominant Hsfs, suggesting an important regulatory role during heat stress. Many TaHsfA members as well as B1, C1, and C2 members were also up-regulated during drought and salt stresses. The heat-induced expression profiles of many heat shock protein (Hsp) genes were paralleled by those of A2 and A6 members. Transactivation analysis revealed that in addition to TaHsfA members (<italic>A2b</italic> and <italic>A4e</italic>), overexpression of <italic>TaHsfC2a</italic> activated expression of TaHsp promoter-driven reporter genes under non-stress conditions, while <italic>TaHsfB1b</italic> and <italic>TaHsfC1b</italic> did not. Functional heat shock elements (HSEs) interacting with TaHsfA2b were identified in four TaHsp promoters. Promoter mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that an atypical HSE (<bold>GAA</bold>CA<bold>TTT</bold>TG<bold>GAA</bold>) in the <italic>TaHsp17</italic> promoter is functional for heat-inducible expression and transactivation by Hsf proteins. The transactivation of Hsp promoter-driven reporter genes by TaHsfC2a also relied on the presence of HSE. An activation motif in the C-terminal domain of TaHsfC2a was identified by amino residue substitution analysis. These data demonstrate the role of HsfA and HsfC2 in regulation of Hsp genes in wheat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Temperate cereal crops such as wheat often encounter heat stress during the reproductive stage in warm-climate wheat production regions (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Wardlaw and Wrigley, 1994</xref>). Heat stress has a significant adverse impact on carbon assimilation and starch synthesis in these environments, which leads to reduction of grain yield as well as grain quality (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Wardlaw and Wrigley, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Skylas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). At the biochemical level, high temperatures cause denaturation of many heat-labile proteins and an elevated level of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Xue and McIntyre, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mittler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Grover <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The acquisition of thermotolerance in plants relies on acclimatization to permissive high temperatures, during which time a large number of heat protection genes such as those encoding heat shock proteins (Hsps) and ROS scavengers are induced (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mittler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In this heat acclimatization process, heat shock factors (Hsfs) play an important role in regulation of this heat-induced transcriptional reprogramming (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Hsf proteins are transcription factors, which are present in all eukaryotes. Hsfs are characterized by the presence of a Hsf DNA-binding domain, which is composed of a central helix&#x2013;turn&#x2013;helix motif and an adjacent bipartite oligomerization domain, made up of of hydrophobic heptad repeats (HR-A and HR-B) (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The oligomerization domain is required for the formation of a trimeric Hsf structure for high affinity binding to DNA (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Peteranderl and Nelson, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Peteranderl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Hsfs are known to recognize the multiple inverted repeats of the nGAAn sequence, known as the heat shock element (HSE), which appears to be present in the promoters of many heat-inducible genes (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Santoro <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Nover <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In general, at least three nGAAn repeats are required for effective Hsf binding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>) and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The Hsf family in the model plant species, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, consists of 21 and 25 members, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), divided into three classes: HsfA, HsfB, and HsfC. Among Hsf members, HsfA genes have been functionally characterized extensively in the model plant species, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, serving as <italic>bona fide</italic> transcription factors binding to HSEs. Despite the DNA-binding domain of the three classes of Hsf members being highly conserved, knowledge about the biological role of the HsfB and HsfC members is still scarce. It is generally recognized that HsfB and HsfC members do not contain an aromatic (W, Y, and F)&#x2013;hydrophobic (L, I, V, and M)&#x2013;acidic (D and E) residue-rich (AHA) activation domain present in HsfA members (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). HsfB members have been demonstrated to act as repressors (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda and Ohme-Takagi, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> have shown that HsfB4b from rice is also capable of binding to HSE. The binding sequence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfB1 has been shown to be different from that of HSEs; it binds to the TL1 element (GAAGAAGAA) and regulates pathogen defence genes (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Pajerowska-Mukhtar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Pick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfB1 can positively regulate the acquired thermotolerance (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Some Hsf genes are constitutively expressed. A number of constitutively expressed HsfA1 proteins such as HsfA1a in tomato are known to be maintained in an inactive monomer state by association with Hsp90/Hsp70 under non-heat stress conditions (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hahn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This complex is dissociated upon heat stress, which enables HsfA1a to form an active trimer. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, constitutively expressed <italic>HsfA1a</italic> and <italic>HsfA1b</italic> are known to be the early response Hsf genes (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lohmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Busch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), serving as transcriptional activators for high-level induction of late response Hsf members such as <italic>HsfA2</italic>, which also plays an important role in acquired thermotolerance (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Charng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In plants, there are some species-specific features in the role of individual Hsf members in regulating genes involved in the heat stress response. HsfA1a in tomato has been described as a master regulator for triggering the heat response and acquired thermotolerance (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, no master regulator has been found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Instead, three subclass A1 Hsfs (A1a, A1b, and A1d) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are functionally redundant for triggering the heat response (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Charng, 2012</xref>). In tomato, HsfB1 functions as a transcription co-activator, cooperating with class A Hsfs during heat stress (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bharti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), while <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfB1 was found to act as a repressor (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Czarnecka-Verner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda and Ohme-Takagi, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In addition, the compositions of Hsf classes differ markedly among plant species (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Most notably, subclass C2 Hsfs appear to be monocot specific. However, the role of this subclass of Hsf in monocots is currently unknown. Conversely, subclasses A9, B3, and B5 are not present in monocot species (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). HsfA9 in sunflower and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is expressed specifically in seeds and controls Hsp expression during seed development (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Almoguera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In rice, HsfA7 appears to be expressed specifically in the seeds under normal conditions (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<italic>a</italic>
</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Investigation into the molecular basis of heat tolerance in wheat was pursued at the Hsp level as early as in the 1980s (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Zivy, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). Acquired thermotolerance in some thermotolerant wheat genotypes appears to be linked to higher transcript or protein levels of some Hsps (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vierling and Nguyen, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Joshi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Skylas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). More recently, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> have shown that overexpression of a small wheat chloroplastic Hsp (<italic>TaHSP26</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> improves thermotolerance. Comparative expression analysis between two genotypes with contrasting thermotolerance using the Affymetrix wheat genome array has shown that a large number of probe sets are differentially expressed in the heat-stressed leaves between the thermotolerant and thermosusceptible genotypes (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, to date, no study has reported on the role of Hsf genes in regulating Hsp expression in wheat. Little is known about the Hsf family structure in wheat and the role of individual members in heat stress adaptation. Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is a hexaploid species and the Hsf family structure in wheat is expected to be more complex than that in diploid species. Only two members, HsfA4a and Hsf3 (HsfB2a), of the wheat Hsf family have been functionally analysed. <italic>TaHsfA4a</italic> is a cadmium-up-regulated gene and is involved in cadmium tolerance in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Shim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>TaHsf3</italic> in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leads to enhanced thermotolerance and freezing tolerance (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In this study, a genome-wide identification of the expressed members of the wheat Hsf family was performed using a bioinformatics analysis of currently available wheat sequences, including those isolated from the authors&#x2019; laboratory. A total of 56 members of the Hsf family from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> were identified. The wheat Hsf family structure was determined by phylogenetic analysis in accordance with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice Hsf families. In order to understand their potential roles, the expression profiles of these Hsf members were investigated in wheat in various organs, in response to heat stress and other abiotic stresses (drought and salt stress). Functional analyses of representative wheat Hsf members were also performed to determine the functional HSE sequences in the promoter regions of four Hsp genes, to investigate whether they are capable of transactivating the expression of Hsp genes, and to identify with which elements they interact. Of particular note, it was demonstrated that a HsfC member was a transcriptional activator of Hsp genes; this has not been shown in any other plant species. These analyses provide some fundamental insights into the role of Hsfs in mediating wheat adaptation to heat stress through regulation of Hsp genes as well as their potential roles in adaptation to other major abiotic stresses.</p>

        <p>The sequences of Hsf DNA-binding domains from rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Hsf proteins in the Plant Transcription Factor Database (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Ria&#xF1;o-Pach&#xF3;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) were used for searching <italic>T. aestivum</italic> Hsf expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the NBCI EST database and the assembled tentative consensus (TC) sequences from the <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> Gene Index (TaGI) database (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/">http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/</uri>). To increase the coverage of partial wheat Hsf cDNAs that lack sequences in the Hsf DNA-binding domain, full-length barley Hsf protein sequences retrieved from the NCBI sequence database were used to find additional wheat Hsf ESTs in the NCBI EST database. Unique Hsf representatives in wheat were identified by sequence alignment and contig assembly. After elimination of unreliable sequences at the ends of some poor quality ESTs, sequences that had &gt;99.5% nucleotide identities were used for assembly into contigs. This analysis corrected many wrongly assembled Hsf TC sequences in the TaGI database. The assembled sequences were checked for correctness in the wheat genomic sequence database (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and partial cDNAs were further extended with wheat genomic sequences. Many EST singletons which had no match with the wheat genomic sequence in the CerealsDB were discarded, as these singletons most probably represent poor sequence quality ESTs. To improve the coverage of the full-length Hsf cDNAs and the accuracy of Hsf cDNA assembly, the coding region sequences of 15 Hsf genes were also isolated using reverse transcription&#x2013;PCR (RT&#x2013;PCR). These cDNA sequences were then incorporated into the Hsf gene assembly. At the final stage, the wheat Hsf protein sequences from the assembled Hsf nucleotide sequences were checked by BLASTP research in the NCBI protein database for the presence of the Hsf DNA-binding domain and the partial Hsf sequences were checked for close homologues of barley full-length Hsf proteins.</p>

Neighbor&#x2013;Joining analysis was performed with pairwise deletion and Poisson correction. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates to assess the level of statistical support for each tree node.

The gene-specific primers were designed at the C-terminal domain or 3&#x2032;-untranslated region. The gene specificity of primers for each gene during primer design was checked by blasting primer sequences in the TaGI database (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=wheat">http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=wheat</uri>) using an expect value setting at 10 000 and was also checked with all TaHsf DNA sequences assembled from this study to avoid matching to non-targeted genes.</p>

The mRNA levels of these internal reference genes were similar in the control and heat-treated samples, as checked by the use of an external reference mRNA (626 nucleotides) <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed from a bovine cDNA (CF767388), which was added to each RNA sample before cDNA synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Xue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The PCR efficiency of each primer pair was determined by a dilution series of samples. The specificity of real-time PCR amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melting temperature curve analysis of real-time PCR-amplified products. The apparent expression level of each gene relative to an internal reference gene (<italic>TaRP15</italic>) was calculated using the following formula: Er<sup>Ct</sup>/Et<sup>Ct</sup>&#xD7;F (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Stephenson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), where Ct is the cycle threshold (PCR cycle number of reference or target gene required for reaching the signal point used for detection across samples), Er is the reference gene (<italic>TaRP15</italic>) amplification efficiency, Et is the target gene amplification efficiency, and F is an amplicon size factor (reference gene amplicon size/target gene amplicon size). Apparent expression level values were tentatively used here to provide an approximate estimation of relative expression levels among various genes under the situation where the absolute quantification of mRNA levels for a large number of genes using a cRNA (or cDNA) calibration curve is not possible.</p>

Of these 56 genes, 39 TaHsf genes contain a full-length coding region sequence. A number of these partial TaHsf proteins identified contain half a Hsf DNA-binding domain. There is a very large intron between the LNTY and GFRK sequence in the DNA-binding domain, and this makes successful extension of partial ESTs difficult using the incomplete wheat genome sequence database in the CerealDB. It is possible that two partial cDNAs, TaHsfA2i and TaHsfA6f, containing an LNTY half-sequence may be a part of GFRK-half cDNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert399/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>).

        <title>Phylogenetic analysis and classification of TaHsf proteins</title>
        <p>In order to gain some insight into the potential function of TaHsf proteins from known function Hsfs in model plant species (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice), phylogenetic analysis of Hsf proteins from wheat, rice, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was performed using the sequence region from the start of DNA-binding domain to the end of the HR-A/B region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Class and subclass classification of TaHsf proteins is based on those of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice Hsf proteins as reported by <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>. The phylogenetic tree of the TaHsf family members is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert399/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, it can be seen that while class B and C Hsf members form distinct groups, class A Hsf protein members form at least three smaller clusters; two of the class A clusters appear to be more similar to class C Hsf proteins than to the third class A cluster. Class C Hsf proteins appear to be more similar to class A Hsfs, compared with class B members. Wheat Hsf proteins cluster more closely with rice Hsfs than with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Hsfs. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> A2 is not clustered with the monocot A2 group. Wheat Hsf A, B, and C classes contain eight, three, and two subclasses, respectively, which are the same as those in the rice Hsf family. Subclasses A9 and B3 are absent in wheat and rice, and subclass C2 is unique in monocot species. TaHsf members with an incomplete sequence of the DNA-binding domain and HR-A/B region were subsequently classified based on their closest sequence homology with TaHsf members containing a complete sequence. In comparison with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Hsf family, the wheat Hsf family contains a large number of A2 group members (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), in addition to the differences in the A9, B3, and C2 groups.</p>

        <title>Organ distribution of TaHsf transcripts</title>
        <p>In order to understand the biological roles of individual TaHsf members in wheat, their relative transcript distribution was surveyed under non-stress conditions in six major organs (leaf, root, stem, hull, endosperm, and embryo), with leaf and endosperm studied at two developmental stages. Real-time PCR primers targeted to the 3&#x2032; regions or C-terminal domain region of cDNAs for TaHsf members were designed with full-length cDNA or containing full or partial C-terminal part sequences, with the exception of <italic>TaHsfA2h</italic>, which was isolated after completion of expression analysis. The mRNA levels of individual members are presented as apparent expression levels relative to the internal control gene, <italic>TaRP15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), which are used for the assessment of relative expression levels between genes (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Stephenson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). TaHsf subclass A1 group genes were constitutively expressed at relatively high levels among the six organs. Other class A genes constitutively expressed at relatively high levels in the green organs examined (leaf, stem, and hull) were some of the A2, A6, and A8 members. Class A members that were predominantly expressed in the endosperm were A2b, A2c, A2e, A5b, A6c, A6d, and A6e, and the apparent expression levels of many of these endosperm-predominantly expressed members were higher than that of the A1 members in the endosperm. In particular, the constitutive expression of A6e in the endosperm was at least three times higher than that of the A1 group genes. A6e is highly homologous to a partial TaHsf cDNA (GD186916) isolated from the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> developing seed heat stress forward subtractive library, which has been shown to have a seed-predominant expression pattern (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<italic>b</italic>

The expression of B4 members was mainly confined to the roots and embryos under normal conditions. The transcript distribution of class C members in these organs had the following features: (i) several C1 members (C1b, C1c, and C1d) were highly expressed in the young leaves and embryos, with the apparent expression level of C1c in the young leaves higher than those of the A1 group; and (ii) C2 members were predominantly expressed in embryos, and their apparent expression levels in embryos and roots were much higher than any other subclasses of TaHsf genes.</p>

The expression of subclass A1 group members was not up-regulated during heat stress; in fact, the A1a mRNA level was down-regulated in leaves with a short-term heat treatment and a marked reduction in its mRNA level was observed in the 1.5h treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Transcript down-regulation by heat in the leaves was also observed in the A3 group, A4c, A4d, A8a, and A8c genes. Heat up-regulation was observed in all A2, A6, and A7 members, as well as in some members of the A4 and A5 groups. In the early heat treatments, the A2 and A6 groups were the predominantly expressed HsfAs in the leaves. In the roots of heat-stressed plants, the A6 group genes were the predominantly expressed HsfA genes. In particular, the A6e mRNA level in the roots in the 1.5h heat treatment was ~25 times higher than that of any of the A1 members.</p>

However, in contrast to B2 members, heat induction of the B1 group in the leaves was transient, and repeated heat stress for 3 d resulted in down-regulation of their transcript levels. The transcript levels of the B2 group during heat stress were the highest among TaHsf subclasses. The B4 group was not heat inducible and their transcript levels in the roots of plants with repeated heat stress were significantly lower than in the non-stress control plants. The C1 group, which were expressed in the leaves under non-stress conditions at very high levels compared with other TaHsf groups, generally showed rapid down-regulation in the early heat treatment (1.5h), particularly in the leaves, and their transcript levels gradually returned back to the control levels with prolonged heat treatment. Most C2 members, which were not expressed in the leaves but were expressed at high levels in the control roots, were also down-regulated by heat stress.

        <title>A number of TaHsf subclasses are up-regulated during drought and salt stress</title>
        <p>Although the major role of Hsfs is known to be the regulation of heat-responsive genes involved in heat acclimatization, it was also of interest to see whether this family is involved in wheat responses to other major abiotic stresses such as drought and salt stress. Using the nucleotide sequences of these identified TaHsf members to search probe sets in the Affymetrix wheat genome array at the NetAffx Analysis Center of the Affymetrix website (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx">http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx</uri>), 22 probe set IDs that have at least four matches out of 11 probes per probe set ID were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, eight probe set IDs cross-hybridize with more than one TaHsf gene, and two genes (C2a and C2g) are represented with each having two probe set IDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). There are two publically deposited Affymetrix data sets, TA23 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.plexdb.org">http://www.plexdb.org</uri>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Aprile <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and E-MEXP-971 (http:/www.ebi.ac/arrayexpress/; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Mott and Wang, 2007</xref>), for transcript profiling in wheat responses to drought and salt stresses. The TA23 data set investigates expression changes in the flag leaves and glumes (two organs pooled) of hexaploid wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic>) and tetraploid wheat (<italic>T. turgidum</italic> subsp. <italic>durum</italic>) at the grain-filling stage during mild or severe drought stress in comparison with control plants. Among these Hsf probe sets, 13, 12, and 10 probe sets had detectable hybridization signals in the flag leaf and glume tissues of <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv. Chinese Spring, the Chinese Spring-5A deletion line, and durum wheat, respectively. Of these detectable probe sets, the A2, A3, A6, C1, and C2 groups generally showed increased expression during drought stress. In contrast, the transcript levels of the A4 and B1 groups were down-regulated by drought. The drought-mediated expression level changes (&lt;4-fold) of these Hsf genes were not as great as those seen in the short-term heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), but were comparable with those during long-term heat stress (3 d with 5h d<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). The transcript level changes of these TaHsf genes in the shoots and roots of <italic>T. aestivum</italic> plants after long-term salt stress from the E-MEXP-971 Affymetrix data set are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>. In this data set, five genotypes were placed (each with three replicates) with the same treatment in the same group to increase the number of biological replicates for analysis. A total of 12 and eight probe sets with a significant increase in expression were observed in the salt-treated shoots and roots, respectively. The up-regulated TaHsf genes were A2, A6, A8, B1, C1, and C2 groups in the shoot and A2, A4, A6, and C1 groups in the root. Some of these increases in the expression levels in salt-stressed plants were remarkable. A &gt;10-fold increase in the A2d mRNA level was seen in the salt-stressed shoot, and a 10-fold increase in the A4 group expression levels was observed in the salt-stressed root.</p>

To confirm that the 22 &#xB0;C samples bombarded with the <italic>TaHsp17</italic> or <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> reporter gene were transformed, tissue sections where GFP foci could be found were selected for histochemical staining of GUS activity, and many strong GUS foci were observed in the samples incubated at 22 &#xB0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), confirming that these <italic>gfp</italic> reporter genes were essentially not expressed in the shoots and roots of wheat seedlings at 22 &#xB0;C.

        <title>TaHsfA2b binds to <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the promoters of heat shock proteins</title>
        <p>Transactivation of <italic>TaHsp17</italic> and <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> genes by the TaHsfA members suggests that these Hsp genes are their target genes. To investigate further whether this transactivation is direct or indirect, whether the class A group was capable of directly binding to the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the promoters of heat-inducible Hsp genes was studied using the TaHsfA2b protein. The available promoter sequences within 1.5kb upstream of the translation start of four Hsp genes (<italic>TaHsp17</italic>, <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic>, <italic>TaHsp26.6</italic>, and <italic>TaHsp70d</italic>) were analysed for the presence of HSEs. <italic>TaHsp26.6</italic> and <italic>TaHsp70d</italic> promoter region sequences were also identified through analysis of the wheat genome sequence database to extend the sequences of <italic>TaHsp26.6</italic> (AF097659) and <italic>TaHsp70d</italic> (AF005993) cDNAs (assembled <italic>TaHsp26.6</italic> and <italic>TaHsp70d</italic> promoter region sequences are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert399/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). A typical HSE (5&#x2032;-nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn or 5&#x2032;-nTCCnnGAAnnTTCn) was found only in the <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> promoter and was named TaHsp90.1E1. Therefore, some sequences containing at least two nGAAn inverted repeats or three nGAAn inverted repeats with gaps or one nucleotide degeneracy in one repeat were retrieved for testing of their binding by TaHsfA2b protein <italic>in vitro</italic> using a CELD fusion system (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Xue, 2002<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, TaHsfA2b binds to many of the sequences selected from these four promoters with varying affinity. At least one functional HSE was found in each of these four promoters. Some atypical HSE sequences (TaHsp26.6E1 and TaHsp70dE2) had even higher TaHsfA2b binding affinity than TaHsp90.1E1. TaHsp90.1E3 with an additional three nucleotides in one spacer of three nGAAn/nTTCn repeats had little detectable TaHsfA2b binding. As some functional TaHsp HSE sequences had one-nucleotide degeneracy, three synthetic sequences (GAAn2GTCn2GAA, TCCn2GCAn2TTC, and AGAAn2TTCT) were tested for TaHsfA2b binding activity. Either non-detectable or &lt;10% of the TaHsp90.1E1 activity was observed in these synthetic oligonucleotides. These data indicate that single-nucleotide degeneracy in a perfect HSE sequence is allowed only in certain positions and three nGAAn inverted repeats are required for effective binding by HsfA. In addition, comparison of TaHsp17E1 and TaHsp17E2 binding activity indicates that the sequence flanking the GAA or TTC core motif also affects Hsf binding. The binding analysis together with transactivation assays implies that <italic>TaHsp17</italic> and <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> are likely to be the direct target genes of TaHsfA2b.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study identified 56 Hsf genes from <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, which can be divided into three classes, A, B, and C. Although not all Hsf members have been identified in this study because the wheat genome sequence is still incomplete, analysis of the phylogentic tree of Hsf proteins from wheat and rice shows that the representatives of all rice subclasses have been identified from wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that TaHsf proteins are more closely clustered with rice Hsfs. Similar to rice, the wheat Hsf family does not contain A9 and B3 subclasses as are present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, but has C2 subclass members. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated strong support for separate B and C classes of Hsfs, but class A Hsf protein members formed at least three smaller clusters. Two of the class A clusters appear to be more similar to class C Hsf proteins than to the third class A cluster. This observation suggests that the A class is paraphyletic and that the C class is derived from a branch of the A class or that some subclasses of class A are really part of the C class. A similar observation was made by <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> when describing the phylogenetic relationships across Hsfs from nine plant species including both monocots and eudicots. They also noted a paraphyletic grouping of the A class Hsf members, whereas the B and C classes of Hsfs were monophyletic. It should also be noted that the branching patterns seen in the current phylogenetic tree figures may be influenced by incomplete data sets (missing wheat Hsfs). In comparison with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato, monocot species (wheat and rice as well as <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>) in general have fewer A1 members, and more A2 and C members per genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, not much is known about the functional diversification of Hsfs in monocots to date.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In this study, the detailed expression profiles of individual TaHsf members in six important organs and heat responses were provided. The subclass A1 group members in wheat were found to be constitutively expressed at relatively high levels in all organs examined and were not up-regulated by heat stress, which is similar to <italic>HsfA1</italic> genes from other species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">H&#xFC;bel and Sch&#xF6;ffl, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, there were many other constitutively expressed TaHsfA members (e.g. the A8 group, and some of the A2 and A6 group members) that were also expressed at relatively higher levels. A2 and A6 members were the main TaHsf members within class A that were up-regulated at a very high level during heat stress. These Hsf proteins are likely to be major transcription factors for up-regulation of Hsp genes during heat stress, as observed in wheat leaves and roots. Other class A genes that were up-regulated by heat were members of the A7 group and some A4 members, but they were expressed at a low level under heat stress, compared with the A2 and A6 groups. However, in terms of fold induction, heat up-regulation of <italic>TaHsfA7</italic> genes was very high. For example, the <italic>TaHsfA7a</italic> mRNA level was increased by 127-fold in the leaves at the 1.5h heat treatment (data not shown). In class B of the TaHsf family, the B1 and B2 groups were strongly up-regulated by heat; however, the expression levels of the B1 group gradually decreased after an initial strong induction. In class C, the C1 group were constitutively expressed at a high level in most organs. In young leaves, the expression levels of the C1 group were even higher than those of the A1 group. The C1 group members were generally down-regulated by heat stress, and their heat response pattern appears to be in the opposite direction to that of the heat-up-regulated A2 and A6 group genes. The C2 group members were predominantly expressed in the embryos and roots, and were also generally down-regulated by heat stress, except C2a and C2b that were up-regulated in the leaves by a short-term heat treatment. Interestingly, marked up-regulation of HsfC2 genes from rice by oxidative and heat stresses or a combination of these stresses has been reported (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Mittal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">From analysis of TaHsf expression profiles, two interesting features are worth mentioning here. First, a number of Hsf members other than the A1 group were constitutively expressed at a level similar to or higher than the A1 group, presuming that they are generally present in an inactive form as is the case for HsfA1 proteins known in other species (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hahn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Secondly, in contrast to what has been observed in sunflower, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and rice (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Almoguera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<italic>a</italic>
</xref>), no seed-specific Hsf members were identified in wheat. However, three A6 members (A6c, A6d, and A6e) and A5b were predominantly expressed in endosperm under non-stress conditions. In addition, four A2 members (A2b, A2c, A2e, and A2f) were also expressed in the endosperm of non-stressed plants at a relatively high level. This suggests that the endosperm is rich in TaHsfA proteins under non-stress conditions, with the assumption that there is no major difference at the translational level among TaHsfA subclasses. The endosperm is an important organ for wheat productivity. Some enzymes involved in starch synthesis in several crop species are known to be thermolabile, such as soluble starch synthase from wheat endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Keeling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>) and pea embryos (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Denyer and Smith, 1992</xref>) and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from maize endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Greene and Hannah, 1998</xref>). Biochemical analysis has shown that the crude extract of soluble starch synthase from wheat endosperm loses its enzyme activity significantly with a 15min treatment at 30 &#xB0;C, and a decrease in the enzyme activity is noticeable even at 25 &#xB0;C with a 2h treatment (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Keeling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Wheat crops in Australia and other warm climate countries often encounter high temperatures above 30 &#xB0;C at the grain-filling stage, which results in a significant reduction in grain yield and quality (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Skylas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The A6 and A2 Hsf genes that were highly expressed in the endosperm are likely to be important Hsf members for keeping the expression of Hsp genes at a high level. Indeed, four out of the five TaHsp genes examined were also expressed at a high level in the endosperm under non-stress conditions, while their mRNA levels in the vegetative organs were either not detectable or at a much lower level. It is tempting to speculate that this expression pattern of heat-inducible TaHsp genes may have an advantage in protecting this important organ against heat stress. Many Hsps are known to function as molecular chaperones and are capable of stabilizing thermolabile proteins against heat denaturation (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Grover <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Waters, 2013</xref>). For example, a mitochondrial small Hsp can improve the electron transport activity of the mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I in plants at high temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Downs and Heckathorn, 1998</xref>). Similarly, a small Hsp from the chloroplast protects the chloroplast photosystem II electron transport activity from heat inactivation (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hechathorn <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Besides their role in wheat adaptation to heat stress, a number of TaHsf groups (A2, A3, A4, A6, B1, and C2) were up-regulated in the flag leaves and glumes of wheat at the grain-filling stage by drought stress. The up-regulation of these genes as well as the A8 and C1 groups was also seen in the shoots of salt-stressed plants. A similar salt up-regulation of these genes was observed in the roots, with the exception of the A8 and C2 groups. These data indicate that some of TaHsf members may have a regulatory role in wheat adaptation to drought and salt stress. Intriguingly, an examination of the expression levels of <italic>TaHsp16.9</italic>, <italic>TaHsp17</italic>, <italic>TaHsp26.6</italic>, and <italic>TaHsp90.1</italic> genes in drought- and salt-stressed wheat plants in the Affymetrix wheat genome array data sets (TA23 and E-MEXP-971) did not reveal up-regulation of these TaHsp genes by drought and salt stresses (data not shown). This suggests that drought- or salt-induced up-regulation of these TaHsfs has no impact on the expression of these TaHsp genes. Possible explanations for this observation include that TaHsf proteins are inactive, or that Hsp genes are in a strongly repressed state in these salt- and drought-stressed organs. Whether these TaHsfs are able to regulate the expression of other stress protection genes during salt and drought stresses requires future investigation. However, it has been shown that overexpression of some HsfA genes, such as <italic>AtHsfA2</italic> and <italic>HaHsfA9</italic>, can result not only in thermotolerance but also in salt and dehydration stress tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Dapena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), implying that some drought- and salt-inducible TaHsf members may have a similar role.</p>

Most of these functional HSEs in the promoters of these wheat Hsp genes contain imperfect HSE sequences, some of which had TaHsfA2b binding affinity even higher than that of the perfect HSE in the <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> promoter. It was shown that TaHsfA2b and TaHsfA4e were transcriptional activators and capable of activating the expression of <italic>TaHsp17-</italic> and <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> promoter-driven reporter genes in the leaves and roots. It appears that TaHsfA2b is a more potent transcriptional activator in transactivation of the <italic>TaHsp17</italic> promoter-driven reporter gene than TaHsfA4e. However, transactivation analysis showed that TaHsfB1b and TaHsfC1b had no ability to activate <italic>TaHsp17</italic> and <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> expression. As no direct evidence in previous studies has shown that B1 and C1 members are transcriptional activators of Hsp genes, it is likely that TaHsfB1 and TaHsfC1 proteins are not responsible for up-regulation of these Hsp genes in wheat, although <italic>TaHsfB1</italic> genes were up-regulated 5- to 10-fold in the leaves and roots at the first 1.5h heat treatment. In heat-stressed tomato, HsfB1 acts as a transcription co-activator, cooperating with class A Hsfs (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bharti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), while <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfB1 functions as a repressor (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Czarnecka-Verner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, rice HsfC1a and HsfC1b can potentially serve as transcriptional activators, as the transactivation activity of these two HsfC1 proteins has been observed in yeast cells by fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Promoter truncation and mutation analyses showed that the TaHsp90.1E1 (<bold>GAA</bold>GC<bold>TTC</bold>GG<bold>GAA</bold>) of the <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> promoter is the HSE responsible for its heat-induced expression by Hsf proteins. An atypical HSE identified in the <italic>TaHsp17</italic> promoter, TaHsp17E1 (<bold>GAA</bold>CA <bold>TTT</bold>TG<bold>GAA</bold>), is also a functional HSE <italic>in vivo</italic>. The addition of either TaHsp90.1E1 or TaHsp17E1 to a minimal promoter derived from the <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> promoter resulted in the heat-inducible expression and transactivation by TaHsfA2b or TaHsfC2a at 22 &#xB0;C. These data implicate that the presence of either TaHsp90.1E1 or TaHsp17E1 is sufficient for heat-mediated expression through interaction with Hsf proteins.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Most interestingly, it was observed that TaHsfC2a acted as a transcriptional activator and was capable of transactivating the expression of the <italic>TaHsp17</italic> or <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> promoter-driven reporter gene. No previous studies to date have shown that a class C Hsf protein can transactivate the Hsp genes. The C-terminal end of TaHsfC2a contains a motif, <bold>LLLD</bold>G<bold>DF</bold>GN<bold>V</bold>SA<bold>F</bold>GP<bold>D</bold>A<bold>VDF</bold>AG<bold>FY</bold>T<bold>DD </bold>AFANAP<bold>V</bold>P<bold>VE,</bold> which resembles an AHA motif (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Nover and Scharf, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The mutation of some aromatic and acidic residues in this motif resulted in the abolishment of TaHsfC2a transactivation activity, suggesting that this AHA-like motif is responsible for its transcriptional activator property. TaHsfC2a was predominantly expressed in the seeds, particularly in the embryo, but was also heat inducible in the leaves with a short-term heat treatment (a 5-fold increase). Up-regulation of rice <italic>HsfC2a</italic> by a short-term heat treatment (10&#x2013;30min) has also been shown in rice seedlings (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). An attempt was also made to investigate whether TaHsfC2a is capable of binding to the functional HSEs present in the TaHsp promoters <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the experiment failed technically due to a very low level of TaHsfC2a&#x2013;CelD fusion protein produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. However, the transactivation of <italic>TaHsp17</italic> and <italic>TaHsp90.1-A1</italic> genes by TaHsfC2a appears to be through its specific interaction with TaHsp17E1 and TaHsp90.1E1 elements, as the promoter mutagenesis experiment demonstrated that the transactivation of <italic>gfp</italic> reporter genes by TaHsfC2a relied on the presence of either TaHsp90.1E1 or TaHsp17E1. Based on its expression pattern and ability to activate Hsp genes, TaHsfC2a probably plays a role in regulation of Hsp expression in the embryos and during early heat stress.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Another intriguing point raised by this study is that transactivation of Hsp genes by TaHsfA2b, TaHsfA4e, and TaHsfC2a does not require heat treatment, indicating that TaHsf proteins are functional at 22 &#xB0;C. Presumably, they are able to form functional trimers under non-stress conditions. The question is why heat-inducible Hsp genes such as <italic>TaHsp17</italic> are not expressed in the leaves and roots of wheat under normal conditions, as some A2 (A2a, A2d, and A2f) and C2 (C2d and C2g) members were expressed in these organs at a level similar to or higher than that of TaHsfA1 members. It has been shown that some repressors (e.g. Hsp70 and Hsp90) bind to Hsf protein to keep them in an inactive monomer form (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Sch&#xF6;ffl, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Yamada <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hahn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). At present, a model of Hsf activation derived from tomato plants is that HsfA1 is a master regulator of the heat response (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and is in an inactive state through complexing with Hsp90 and Hsp70 (repressors) in non-stress conditions (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hahn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there is no single master Hsf, and three A1 members together serve as heat response-triggering factors (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Charng, 2012</xref>). Upon heat stress, Hsp90 and Hsp70 are released from HsfA1 to form a functional trimer, which subsequently activates expression of other HsfA members. However, constitutively expressed HsfA genes in wheat include some A2, A6, and A8 members in addition to A1 members. This implies that some repressors can keep all these constitutively expressed TaHsf transcriptional activators in an inactive form in wheat. An alternative hypothesis is that some repressors (e.g. transcriptional repressors) other than Hsp90 and Hsp70 may interfere with Hsf transcriptional activity at the Hsf protein and Hsp promoter assembly point in wheat to keep Hsp genes in a repressed state under non-stress conditions. These hypotheses suggest that Hsp gene activation by the Hsf proteins in wheat plant cells is likely to be dependent on the relative amounts of TaHsf proteins and their repressors. When TaHsf protein amounts are in a substantial excess compared with the amounts of their repressors such as Hsf overexpression in the transactivation assays or heat stress, Hsp genes become activated. This may also apply to the high level expression of some heat-inducible Hsp genes (e.g. <italic>TaHsp17</italic>, <italic>TaHsp26.6</italic>, <italic>TaHsp70d</italic>, and <italic>TaHsp90.1A1</italic>) in wheat endosperms and embryos under non-stress conditions.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">It will be interesting to investigate whether genetic variability in Hsp levels and thermotolerance in wheat detected in early studies (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Zivy, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vierling and Nguyen, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Skylas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) is contributed by differences in expression of some critical regulators&#x2014;TaHsfs. Possibly, some TaHsf genes could be important quantitative trait loci for determining thermotolerance. A substantial amount of research is still required to unlock the mystery of a Hsf&#x2013;Hsp regulation model and the molecular mechanisms of heat adaptation in this important crop species&#x2014;wheat. This will be an important research issue to address in the future, to assist in ensuring an adequate food supply in the predicted global warming scenario.</p>
