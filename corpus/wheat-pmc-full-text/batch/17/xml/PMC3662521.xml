          <title>Background and Aims</title>
          <p>Phosphorus deficiency is a major limiting factor for crop yield worldwide. Previous studies revealed that <italic>PHR1</italic> and it homologues play a key role in regulating the phosphate starvation response in plants. However, the function of <italic>PHR</italic> homologues in common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is still not fully understood. The aim of the study was to characterize the function of <italic>PHR1</italic> genes in regulating phosphate signalling and plant growth in wheat.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Wheat transgenic lines over-expressing a wheat <italic>PHR1</italic> gene were generated and evaluated under phosphorus-deficient and -sufficient conditions in hydroponic culture, a soil pot trial and two field experiments.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Key Results</title>
          <p>Three <italic>PHR1</italic> homologous genes <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic>, <italic>B1</italic> and <italic>D1</italic> were isolated from wheat, and the function of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> was analysed. The results showed that Ta-PHR1-A1 transcriptionally activated the expression of <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> in yeast cells. Over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in wheat upregulated a subset of phosphate starvation response genes, stimulated lateral branching and improved phosphorus uptake when the plants were grown in soil and in nutrient solution. The data from two field trials demonstrated that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased grain yield by increasing grain number per spike.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The world is facing an immense challenge to increase food productivity for its growing population. As phosphorus (P) fertilizers are essential for growing our food, annual consumption of P fertilizers has increased rapidly in the past decades and is expected to increase by 50&#x2013;100 % by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C10">Cordell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, the majority of P applied to soil is immobilized and becomes unavailable for plants; the recovery of applied P by crops in a growing season is often low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C46">Schachtman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C53">Vance <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, P fertilizer is mainly made from the non-renewable phosphate rock, which is expected to run out in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C10">Cordell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Therefore, systematic approaches need to be made to use soil P and fertilizer P sustainably and efficiently, including development of P-efficient crop varieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C30">Lynch, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is well documented that genetic differences in P use efficiency exist among plant species and genotypes within a species, indicating that it is possible to improve P use efficiency of plants through a genetic approach. Conventional selection methods have been shown to be successful in breeding crops with improved P use efficiency. For example, the CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre) wheat programme has selected wheat cultivars that can efficiently acquire P under low P conditions, but also respond to P applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C31">Manske <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). As P has low mobility and high fixation in soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C46">Schachtman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), selecting root traits with an increased root&#x2013;soil contact area and ability to mobilize unavailable P is crucial in improving P use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C31">Manske <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). However, these root traits are hidden in the soil; therefore, root breeding through conventional phenotypic selection is time consuming and destructive. It has been shown that quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root morphology and architecture are linked to those for P acquisition efficiency in soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) and wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C61">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C27">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; Y. Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C43">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This suggests that marker-assisted selection will facilitate efficient selection for root traits in root breeding for P use efficiency.</p>
      <p>Besides conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection, gene modification has also successfully improved P use efficiency of crops. In response to P deficiency, plants have evolved a wide range of morphological, physiological and biochemical strategies to improve P mobilization and uptake from soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C41">Raghothama, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C6">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C39">Plaxton and Tran, 2011</xref>). Alterations in root architecture are important to enable plants to explore new Pi resources in the soil more efficiently. Under P-deficient conditions, plants increase their root hair length and density, and lateral or adventitious root number and length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C29">Lopez-Bucio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C30">Lynch, 2011</xref>). Recently, a &#x3B2;-expansin gene, <italic>Gm-EXPB2</italic>, has been shown to regulate root architecture responses to Pi starvation in soybean, and over-expressing <italic>Gm-EXPB2</italic> significantly improves P uptake and growth of soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C19">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Since most of the soil P presents in sparingly soluble forms which can be mobilized by root-secreted protons (H<sup>+</sup>), low molecular weight organic anions and phosphatase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C10">Cordell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), stimulating root secretions through gene modification (e.g. over-expressing phosphatase) has been shown to be effective in enhancing Pi acquisition and growth of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C51">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). For instance, over-expressing a wheat malate transporter (<italic>Ta-ALMT1</italic>) was shown to enhance P uptake and grain yield of barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) grown on an acid soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C12">Delhaize <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The phosphate transport gene family PHT1 is pivotal for Pi uptake from soil and the transportation of Pi from root to shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C8">Chiou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C48">Schunmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C36">Nagarajan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Over-expression of the <italic>PHT1</italic> gene facilitates Pi uptake in transgenic rice plants, and even results in excess P accumulation toxic to plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C22">Jia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>); however, it does not function in increasing Pi uptake in transgenic barley plants grown in nutrient solution and soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C40">Rae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The complex gene network responding to Pi starvation is mediated by a number of regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C47">Schachtman and Shin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C38">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C7">Chiou and Lin, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C20">Hammond and White, 2011</xref>). Over-expression of a transcription factor, <italic>PTF1</italic> (<italic>Pi starvation induced transcription factor 1</italic>), enhances P uptake and yield under P-deficient conditions in both rice and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C56">Yi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C26">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), showing the importance of transcription factors in improving P use efficiency of crops. In the signalling network in sensing P availability, the MYB-CC (coiled-coil) type transcription factor <italic>PHR1</italic> plays a central role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C7">Chiou and Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). PHR1 was first reported to regulate a small subset of Pi starvation-inducible genes in arabidopsis by binding as a dimer to the <italic>cis</italic>-element P1BS (GNATATNC) in the promoter region of its downstream gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Defective mutation in <italic>At-PHR1</italic> impairs a broad range of Pi starvation responses, including the responsiveness of various Pi starvation-inducible genes, root morphology and metabolic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Recent genome-wide analysis revealed that the majority of Pi starvation-inducible genes contain the P1BS element, and hence the <italic>PHR1</italic> gene has been considered to play a more important role than had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C34">Muller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C38">2010</xref>). <italic>At-PHR1</italic> and its homologues <italic>PHL1</italic> in arabidopsis and <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> in rice regulate a set of Pi starvation-inducible genes, including those involving Pi uptake and redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C4">Bustos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Over-expression of <italic>PHR1</italic> in arabidopsis results in strongly increased Pi uptake irrespective of P regime, providing a useful approach for molecular breeding of plants towards more efficient Pi uptake and assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, enhanced Pi uptake by over-expressing <italic>PHR1</italic> does not essentially improve plant growth. For example, over-expression of <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> in rice dramatically increases Pi uptake under a range of P supply levels, but it greatly inhibits growth and yield of rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The growth retardation mediated by <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> may be caused by toxicity of excessive Pi accumulation in shoots, or by some unknown genetic factor(s) regulated by <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C55">Wu and Xu, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world. Worldwide wheat production annually consumes 6&#xB7;5 Mt of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (approx. 40 % of P used by cereal crops), much higher than used by other cereals, including rice and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C14">FAO, 2006</xref>). Therefore, improving P use efficiency of wheat is important in sustainable use of P resources. To breed wheat with improved P use efficiency, understanding the Pi signalling network in wheat is important. Presently, only a few Pi starvation-inducible genes have been cloned and their expression patterns have been analysed, including various <italic>PHT1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C11">Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C17">Glassop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C52">Tittarelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), thus the Pi signalling network in wheat remains largely unknown. Although improving P use efficiency via transgenic modification has been reported in a number of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C42">Ramaekers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C51">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), studies of transgenic wheat with improved P use efficiency are still lacking. Here, we isolated three wheat <italic>PHR1</italic> genes (<italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic>, <italic>B1</italic> and <italic>D1</italic>) with homology to <italic>At-PHR1</italic>, and characterized the function of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in regulating the Pi starvation response. We found that <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> is involved in Pi signalling in wheat and, when over-expressed, it increased P uptake and grain yield of wheat. Our research promotes the understanding of Pi signalling in wheat, and provides valuable gene resource for breeding wheat with improved P use efficiency and yield.</p>

        <p>The wild type and the T<sub>4</sub> transgenic lines Ov-1 and Ov-2 were used in the hydroponic culture, soil pot experiment and field trials. The hydroponic culture was carried out in a growth chamber which was set at 20 &#xB1; 1 &#xB0;C, 50&#x2013;70 % relative humidity and a photon fluence rate of 300 &#xB5;mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> with a 16 h day/8 h night cycle. Two treatments were used, the Pi-sufficient nutrient solution (high P) contained 200 &#xB5;<sc>m</sc> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> as described previously (Y. Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C43">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and the Pi-deficient nutrient solution (low P) contained 10 &#xB5;<sc>m</sc> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and an additional 190 &#xB5;<sc>m</sc> KCl. Seeds were germinated in saturated CaSO<sub>4</sub> solution for 7 d at 20 &#xB0;C, and then the germinated seeds with residual endosperm removed were transferred to plastic pots containing 1 L of nutrient solution. The nutrient solution was refreshed every day and its pH was adjusted to 6&#xB7;0 with dilute HCl and KOH before refreshing. The pots each contained three plants and were air-aerated and placed randomly in the growth chamber. For evaluating plant growth and P uptake (HC trial 1), the plants were grown in the high and low P nutrient solutions for 21 d, and then the shoots and roots were collected separately to measure dry weight, root morphological parameters and total P concentration. For detection of gene expression (HC trial 2), the plants were grown in the high and low P nutrient solutions for 7 d, and then the shoots and roots were collected separately for future analysis.</p>
        <p>The soil pot trial was conducted using a calcareous soil with an Olsen-P level of 5&#xB7;9 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The soil was collected from the experimental station of the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB), Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. The trial was carried out from 2 March to 30 April in 2009 (60 d) and consisted of three P supply levels each with four replicates: P0 (0 mg P kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> soil), P5 (5 mg P kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> soil) and P20 (20 mg P kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> soil) as potassium dihydrogen phosphate. All three treatments were provided with 75 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of N (as urea) and 25 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of K (as potassium chloride). The fertilizers were thoroughly mixed with the soil before sowing. The seeds of the wild type and the transgenic lines were germinated at 25 &#xB0;C for 2 d. Six germinated seedlings were planted in each plastic pot containing 3 kg of air-dried soil, and were thinned to three plants per pot at the three-leaf stage. The pots were placed randomly outdoors, and their positions were changed every week. The aerial parts of the plants were harvested for determination of tiller number, shoot dry weight, Pi concentration and total P concentration. The roots were collected to measure root dry weight and total P concentration.</p>

Both trials received two P treatments, the &#x2013;P treatment received no P and the +P treatment received 13&#xB7;5 g m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> of P as calcium superphosphate before sowing. In both treatments, 7&#xB7;4 g m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> of K were applied in the form of potassium chloride before sowing, and 18&#xB7;0 g m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> of N in the form of urea were applied: 12 g m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> before sowing and 6 g m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> at the stem elongation stage. A random block design with six replications was used in both trials. Seeds were sown at the end of September, and plants were harvested in the middle of the following June. Both trials had a seed rate of 150 seeds m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>. The Beijing field trial had two 1&#xB7;5 m long rows with a row spacing of 23 cm in each replication, and the Hebei field trial had three 3 m long rows with a row spacing of 23 cm in each replication. Total biomass yield per plant, grain yield per plant, spike number per plant and grain number of the primary spike were recorded on 30 representative plants. Thousand-grain weight was determined according to the dry weight of 500 dried grains. The total P concentrations in the straw and grain in the Beijing field trial were measured.</p>

        <p>By using the protein sequences of At-PHR1 (NP_194590) and Cr-PSR1 (XP_001700553) as queries, we identified possible <italic>PHR1</italic> ESTs in wheat through a dbEST search in the NCBI database. According to the EST sequences, we isolated a full-length cDNA sequence, named <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic>, from wheat variety Xiaoyan 54. Then <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic> was used to design PCR primers to screen the Xiaoyan 54 BAC library, and finally three full-length genomic DNA sequences containing <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic> homologues were obtained. These three genes were mapped on chromosomes 7A, 4B and 4D by using a set of deletion lines of &#x2018;Chinese Spring&#x2019; (Supplementary Data Fig. S1), and thus were named <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic>, <italic>Ta-PHR1-B1</italic> and <italic>Ta-PHR1-D1</italic>, respectively. These three genes had the same gene structures with identical exon sizes and similar intron sizes, except that there was a 1035 bp miniature inverted transposable element (MITE) insertion in intron 4 of <italic>Ta-PHR1-B1</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F1">1</xref>A).

        <p>As Ta-PHR1s were predicted to contain a CC domain (Supplementary Data Fig. S2), a fold usually involved in protein&#x2013;protein interactions, we used the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay system described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C15">Gampala <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> to detect Ta-PHR1 homodimer in arabidopsis protoplast cells.

When protoplast cells were transformed with the empty vectors pX-nYFP + pX-cYFP, a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) signal was produced throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F3">3</xref>A), indicating that the BiFC system worked well under our experimental conditions.

FISH analysis using the <italic>pUbi::Ta-PHR1-</italic>pACH25 probe showed that there was no fluorescence signal on the chromosomes of the wild type (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F4">4</xref>A), but there were fluorescence signals on a pair of chromosomes of the two independent transgenic lines (designated as Ov-1 and Ov-2) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F4">4</xref>B, C), indicating that <italic>pUbi::Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> was successfully introduced into the genome of the wild type. These two transgenic lines expressed <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic> more stronly than the wild type under both low P and high P conditions in HC trial 2, indicating that <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> was over-expressed in the transgenic lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F4">4</xref>D).

        <p>The members of the MT4/TPS1 family have been used as molecular indicators of plant Pi status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C49">Shin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and have been found to be regulated by <italic>PHR1</italic> and its rice homologue <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). To determine whether this is the same case in wheat, we checked the expression of <italic>Ta-IPS1.1</italic> and <italic>Ta-IPS1.2</italic>, members of the MT4/TPS1 family, in the wild type and the <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> transgenic lines in a hydroponic trial (HC trial 2). In the wild type, <italic>Ta-IPS1.1</italic> and <italic>Ta-IPS1.2</italic> were strongly upregulated by the low P treatment in both the roots and shoots (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>A; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aob/mct080/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> S3A), indicating that both the roots and shoots in the low P treatment were P starved. By comparing the expression levels of <italic>Ta-IPS1.1</italic> and <italic>Ta-IPS1.2</italic> between the wild type and transgenic lines, we found that the over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> mainly affected the expression of <italic>Ta-IPS1.1</italic> under low P conditions. In the low P treatment, the mRNA levels of <italic>Ta-IPS1.1</italic> in the transgenic lines Ov-1 and Ov-2 were slightly higher in the shoots, and about 2-fold higher in the roots than those in the wild type (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>A). No significant difference was found in the expression of <italic>Ta-IPS1.2</italic> between the wild type and transgenic lines under either high P or low P conditions (Supplementary Data Fig. S3A).

        <p>As has been shown above, Ta-PHR1-A1 activated the expression of <italic>GUS</italic> driven by the <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> promoter in yeast cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F3">3</xref>C). Therefore, we examined the expression of the <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> gene in the wild type and transgenic lines. As has been shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C11">Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> was specifically expressed in the roots, and was upregulated by the low P treatment in both the wild type and transgenic lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>B). Compared with the wild type, the two transgenic lines had higher expression levels of <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> in the roots under both high and low P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>B), indicating that over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic> up-regulated <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic>. We also investigated the expression levels of <italic>Ta-PHT1.6</italic>, a PHT1 gene mainly expressed in the shoots. <italic>Ta-PHT1.6</italic> had detectable expression in both the shoots and the roots, and was upregulated by the low P treatment in the shoots (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>C). Compared with the wild-type plants, the <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> transgenic plants had higher <italic>Ta-PHT1.6</italic> mRNA levels in the shoots and roots under both high and low P conditions, and particularly in the shoots under low P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Besides the above-mentioned Pi starvation-inducible genes, we also analysed other Pi starvation-inducible genes, including <italic>Ta-PHF1</italic> homologous to arabidopsis and rice PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (<italic>PHF1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C18">Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), <italic>Ta-PHO2</italic>, homologous to arabidopsis <italic>At-PHO2/UBC24</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C1">Bari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), <italic>Ta-SPX3</italic> homologous to the rice SPX domain gene <italic>Os-SPX3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C54">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), <italic>Ta-PAP16</italic> encoding a purple acid phosphatase homologous to arabidopsis <italic>PAP16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C25">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), <italic>Ta-SQD2</italic> encoding sulfolipid synthase homologous to arabidopsis <italic>SQD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C57">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and <italic>Ta-MGD2</italic> encoding a UDP-galactose-dependent digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase homologous to arabidopsis <italic>MGD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C24">Kelly and D&#xF6;rmann, 2002</xref>).

        <p>We investigated the effects of over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> on the growth of wheat seedlings using both hydroponic culture (HC trial 1) and a soil pot trial. In HC trial 1, the low P treatment reduced tiller number and shoot dry weight, and increased root dry weight and the root/shoot ratio of both the wild type and transgenic lines, compared with the high P treatment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>A&#x2013;E), indicating that the wheat plants grown in the low P treatment were subjected to P-deficient stress. In the low P treatment, both of the transgenic lines had a significantly higher tiller number, root dry weight and root/shoot ratio than the wild type; however, only one of the transgenic lines had significantly higher shoot dry weight and root dry weight than the wild type in the high P treatment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>B&#x2013;E).

        <p>As over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased root dry weight, we then analysed how <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> affected root morphology. Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> did not always increase primary root length, as only the transgenic line Ov-2 had a higher primary root length than the wild type in the high P treatment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F7">7</xref>A). The two transgenic lines had a higher root tip number, lateral root length and total root length than the wild type under both high and low P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F7">7</xref>B&#x2013;D). These results suggested that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> mainly increased lateral root branching.

The scan images were then used to measure root tip number (B) and total root length (TRL, D) with WinRHIZO software. Primary root length (PRL, A) was measured by using SigmaScan Pro 5 software (Systat Software Inc.). Total lateral root length (LRL, C) was calculated by subtracting the primary root length from the total root length.

        <title>Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> improves P uptake</title>
        <p>We analysed P uptake by wheat seedlings grown in nutrient solution in HC trial 1, and in the soils in the pot trial. In HC trial 1, both of the transgenic lines had significantly higher total P concentration and P content in the shoots, and significantly higher P uptake than the wild type under both high and low P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>F, H, J), but had a similar total P concentration and P content in the roots to the wild type (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>G, I). These results indicated that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased P uptake, and promoted P translocation from roots to shoots as reflected by the ratios of shoot P content over P uptake (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>K). In the pot trial, only the transgenic line Ov-2 was found to have an increased total P concentration in the shoots at the P-fertilizer rate P0, and P content in the roots at the P-fertilizer rates P0 and P5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>D, H). However, one or both of the transgenic lines were found to have an increased leaf Pi concentration (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>F) and P uptake at the P-fertilizer rates P0 and P5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>I).</p>
        <p>In the field trial in Beijing, we analysed the total P concentration in the grains and straw. In the &#x2013;P treatment, both of the transgenic lines had a higher total P concentration and P content in the grains and straw, and higher P accumulation in the above-ground parts; in the +P treatment, only the transgenic line Ov-1 was found to have increased grain P content and P accumulation in the above-ground parts (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>). Over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> did not significantly affect the distribution of P in the grains (P harvest index; Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> is involved in Pi starvation signalling in wheat</title>
        <p>By screening a common wheat BAC library, we cloned three <italic>PHR1</italic> homologous genes <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic>, <italic>Ta-PHR1-B1</italic> and <italic>Ta-PHR1-D1</italic> which are located on chromosomes 7A, 4B and 4D, respectively (Supplementary Data Fig. S1). The location of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> on chromosome 7A may be caused by structural rearrangement between chromosome arms 7AL and 4BS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C13">Devos <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). These three genes had the same gene structures with identical exon sizes and similar intron sizes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F1">1</xref>A), and their deduced protein sequences showed high similarities to each other (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F1">1</xref>B). The high similarity in gene sequence, structure and chromosomal location indicates that <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic>, <italic>B1</italic> and <italic>D1</italic> were homologous alleles. The deduced proteins of these three genes contained a conserved MYB DNA-binding domain and a predicted CC domain (Supplementary Data Fig. S2), as have been shown for At-PHR1, At-PHL1 and Os-PHR1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C4">Bustos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>At-PHR1 and its homologues At-PHL1 in arabidopsis and Os-PHR2 in rice regulate a set of Pi starvation-inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C4">Bustos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), reflecting the key role of <italic>PHR1</italic> in Pi starvation signalling. The direct targets of PHR1 are found to be greatly enriched in P1BS containing Pi starvation-inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C4">Bustos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our current study showed that Ta-PHR1-A1 formed a homodimer (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F3">3</xref>A), and conferred transcriptional activation of <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F3">3</xref>B, C), whose promoter contains a putative P1BS element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C32">Miao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This result demonstrated that Ta-PHR1-A1 was a functional transcriptional factor in regulating Pi starvation-inducible genes. Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in wheat upregulated <italic>Ta-PHT1.2,</italic> and other Pi starvation-inducible genes, including <italic>Ta-IPS1.1</italic> and <italic>Ta-PHT1.6</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>), further confirming the role of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in Pi signalling in wheat. As the expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic>, like that of <italic>At-PHR1</italic> and <italic>Os-PHR2</italic>, was not dramatically regulated by Pi supply levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F2">2</xref>B), it is assumed that Ta-PHR1s might be subjected to post-translational regulation in Pi starvation signalling in wheat. Previously the post-translational regulation on PHR1 protein has been shown in arabidopsis, in which At-PHR1 protein can be sumoylated by SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C33">Miura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> did not obviously alter the expression levels of <italic>Ta-IPS1.2</italic>, <italic>Ta-PHF1</italic>, <italic>Ta-PHO2</italic>, <italic>TaSPX3</italic>, <italic>Ta-PAP16</italic>, <italic>Ta-SQD2</italic> and <italic>Ta-MGD2</italic> (Supplementary Data Fig. S3), suggesting that transcriptional factors other than <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> may function in Pi signalling in wheat. In each genome of arabidopsis and rice, there are at least two PHR1 homologues that differentially regulate Pi starvation-inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C45">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C4">Bustos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). For example, the rice Pi starvation-inducible genes <italic>Os-IPS1</italic>, <italic>Os-IPS2</italic>, <italic>Os-PAP16</italic> and <italic>Os-SQD2</italic> are regulated by <italic>Os-PHR2</italic>, but not by <italic>Os-PHR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>

        <title>Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> promotes wheat growth and grain yield</title>
        <p>Over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> enhanced wheat seedling development when grown in the soil or in nutrient solution. At the seedling stage in the pot trial, over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> promoted tiller number regardless of P supply levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>A), and increased shoot dry weight under P-deficient conditions (P-fertilizer rates P0 and P5) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>B). When the plants were grown in the nutrient solution (HC trial 1), the effects of over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> on increasing tiller number and shoot dry weight were also observed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>B, C). However, over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> did not increase average tiller size as reflected by average shoot dry weight per tiller (shoot dry weight/tiller number). We calculated shoot dry weight/tiller number values according to the data of tiller number and shoot dry weight in the pot trial (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>A, B), and found that shoot dry weight/tiller number was lower for the transgenic lines than for the wild type at all the three P-fertilizer rates. For example, shoot dry weight/tiller number was 0&#xB7;150 for the wild type, and was 0&#xB7;137 and 0&#xB7;124 for Ov-1 and Ov-2 at the P-fertilizer rate P0, respectively. The smaller tiller size of the transgenic lines may partially explain the results of the two field trials in that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> did not increase spike number per plant (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>), as a small tiller size may not favour its development into a productive spike.</p>
        <p>Over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> also improved grain yield of wheat under field conditions. In the field trials carried out at two different sites (Beijing and Hebei), over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased grain yield under P-sufficient conditions, and also showed positive effects on grain yield under P-deficient conditions (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>). Compared with the wild type, the increased grain yields of the transgenic lines were due to the effects of over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> on increasing grain number per spike, but not spike number per plant and 1000-grain weight (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>). Taken together, our research demonstrated the positive regulation by <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> on wheat growth and yield performance. The regulation of plant growth has been reported for <italic>PHR1</italic> and its homologues previously. In arabidopsis, the functional loss of <italic>PHR1</italic> results in reduced growth of the shoot, irrespective of external Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Over-expressing <italic>PHR1</italic> and its homologues has been reported to inhibit growth in rice and <italic>Brassica napus</italic>; the growth retardation may be caused by excessive Pi accumulation in the shoots of the transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C43">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In these two studies on rice and <italic>B. napus</italic>, <italic>OsPHR2</italic> and <italic>BnPHR1</italic> were upregulated by several fold, and consequently the shoots of the transgenic lines accumulated several fold higher Pi concentrations than those of the wild type. When we over-expressed <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in arabidopsis, we also observed that the transgenic lines accumulated a much higher Pi concentration in the shoot, and had less shoot biomass than the wild type (unpublished data). Therefore, the increasing effect of over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> on wheat growth was possibly due to the fact that the expression levels of <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic> were only moderately upregulated (about 50 % higher) in the transgenic lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F4">4</xref>D), and the leaf Pi concentrations in the transgenic lines were also moderately increased (about 30 % higher, Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increases lateral root branching</title>
        <p>In response to low availability of P in the rhizosphere, plants have developed highly specialized morphological adaptive mechanisms to increase the ability of their root systems to utilize Pi from soils; these include increased root/shoot ratio, enhanced adventitious rooting and lateral root branching, and greater root hair density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C16">George <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Besides its role in regulating the expression of Pi starvation-inducible genes, <italic>PHR1</italic> and its homologues have been found to regulate root growth. In arabidopsis, the functional loss of <italic>PHR1</italic> reduces root growth, regardless of external Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A more detailed study showed that the <italic>phr1</italic> mutant has decreased root hair length, while over-expressing <italic>PHR1</italic> increases root hair length under P-deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C4">Bustos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In rice, over-expression of <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> has also been found to increase root hair length and density, and to enhance the elongation of the primary root and adventitious roots under P-deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the effect of <italic>PHR1</italic> and its homologues on lateral root development is not yet known. In the current study, the <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> transgenic plants had higher root dry weight than the wild type under P-deficient conditions in the pot trial (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>C). When grown in the nutrient solution in HC trial 1, the <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> transgenic lines also had a higher root dry weight than the wild type under low P conditions, and also under high P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>D), and an increased root/shoot ratio under low P condition (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>E), indicating that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased root response to P deficiency, and further confirming the roles of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in Pi signalling. More detailed analysis demonstrated that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased root tip number (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F7">7</xref>B), lateral root length (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F7">7</xref>C) and, consequently, total root length, under both low and high P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F7">7</xref>D). These results supported the positive regulation by <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> of lateral root branching. However, over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> did not constitutively increase primary root length, as only the transgenic line Ov-2 had a longer primary root length than the wild type under high P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F7">7</xref>A). Taking these results together, <italic>At-PHR1</italic>, <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> and <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> differentially regulate root morphology, although they all are involved in Pi signalling.</p>

        <title>Over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increases P uptake</title>
        <p>Over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased P uptake when the plants were grown either in the nutrient solution (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>) or in the soil (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>, Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>). However, the increasing effects were more pronounced in the nutrient solution than in the soil; this phenomenon was possibly due to the low mobility of Pi in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C46">Schachtman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In the hydroponic culture (HC trial 1), over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased shoot total P concentration (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>F), shoot P content (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>H) and P uptake under both low and high P conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>J), but not root total P concentration (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>G) and root P content (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>I), resulting in a greater distribution of P from roots to shoots in the transgenic lines than in the wild type (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F6">6</xref>K). The increased P distributions in shoots have also been observed in <italic>At-PHR1</italic> and <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> over-expressing lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased the distribution of P from roots to shoots at the seedling stage in the hydroponic culture, it did not increase the distribution of P from shoots to grains, as the P harvest index showed no difference between the transgenic lines and the wild type in the field trial in Beijing (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>). When the plants were grown in soil in the pot trial and the field trial in Beijing, increases of P uptake mediated by over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> were mainly detected under P-deficient conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>I, Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCT080TB1">1</xref>), this was possible because over-expression of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> increased root dry weight under P-deficient conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F8">8</xref>C). Enhanced root development has been reported by many researchers to increase the ability of the root system to utilize P from soils (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C16">George <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
        <p>The increased P uptake and distribution in the shoots in the transgenic lines may also be due to the fact that over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> upregulated the expression of <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> and <italic>1.6</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>B, C). The PHT1 type of Pi transporters mainly function in Pi acquisition from soils and translocation from roots to other parts of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C3">Bucher, 2007</xref>). <italic>Ta-PHT1.2</italic> encodes a functional high-affinity Pi transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C59">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and is predominantly expressed in the roots (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>B), suggesting its role in P uptake. <italic>Ta-PHT1.6</italic> is expressed in both shoots and roots under high P conditions, and more abundantly in the shoots of P-starved plants (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCT080F5">5</xref>C), implying that <italic>Ta-PHT1.6</italic> may play a role in mediating the distribution of P from roots to shoots. The upregulation of <italic>PHT1</italic> transporters by over-expressing <italic>At-PHR1</italic> and <italic>Os-PHR2</italic> has been reported in arabidopsis and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C37">Nilsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), respectively, and was found to be responsible for most of the <italic>Os-PHR2</italic>-mediated accumulation of excess shoot Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCT080C28">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). As information on the sequence, function and expression of PHT1 genes in wheat remains largely unknown, further detailed research on PHT1 genes and their regulation by <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> will help us to better understand the mechanism of the control of <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in P uptake and re-distribution within wheat plants.</p>
        <p>In summary, we cloned three <italic>PHR1</italic> genes on chromosomes 7A, 4B and 4D in wheat. The three <italic>Ta-PHR1</italic> genes are highly similar in sequence, and share the same gene structures. Our data showed that <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> was involved in Pi signalling in wheat, and over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> in wheat upregulated Pi starvation-inducible genes, stimulated later root growth and hence improved P uptake. Over-expressing <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> also improved shoot growth and grain yield. The positive regulation by <italic>Ta-PHR1-A1</italic> of P uptake and plant growth will provide a valuable approach to engineer crops with improved P use efficiency and yield performance.</p>
