      <abstract>
        <p>Pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> oxygenase (PaO) is a key enzyme in chlorophyll catabolism that is known to suppress cell death in maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The catalytic activity of PaO in chlorophyll degradation has been clearly demonstrated, but the function of PaO in the regulation of cell death and plant&#x2013;microbe interactions is largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a PaO homologue in wheat of the <italic>lethal leaf-spot 1</italic> gene, <italic>TaLls1</italic>, that was induced in leaves infected by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>) and wounding treatment. The TaLls1 protein contains a conserved Rieske [2Fe-2S] motif and a mononuclear iron-binding site typical of PaOs. Silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> by virus-induced gene silencing in wheat led to leaf cell death without pathogen attacks, possibly due to the accumulation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> (upstream substrate of PaO), indicating a suppressor role of <italic>TaLls1</italic>, while overexpression of <italic>TaLls1</italic> also triggered cell death in both tobacco and wheat leaves, probably owing to the accumulation of the red chlorophyll catabolite (downstream product of PaO). Further deletion mutant analysis showed that the conserved Rieske domain, but not the iron-binding site, was essential for cell death induction. These results thus suggest a threshold for <italic>TaLls1</italic> in maintaining cell homeostasis to adapt in various stresses, and shed new light on the role of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in cell death regulation. Furthermore, silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in wheat did not change the disease symptoms but enhanced tolerance to <italic>Pst</italic> via an significant increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, elevated cell death occurrence, and upregulation of pathogenesis-related genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plants mount elaborate defence mechanisms to protect themselves from various environmental stresses (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hutcheson, 1998</xref>). Programmed cell death is one key defence mechanism in plants, and is an important process involved in development and defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Dangl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In plant&#x2013;microbe interactions, programmed cell death occurs during the hypersensitive response (HR) to avirulent pathogens, as well as in response to an attack by a virulent pathogen (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg, 1997</xref>). As a typical resistant response, HR is characterized as a rapid and localized cell death that occurs at or around the infection sites that are caused by avirulent pathogens, and its purpose is to protect plants from further pathogen colonization. HR is triggered by the recognition of a plant <italic>resistance</italic> (<italic>R</italic>) gene product and a pathogen <italic>avirulence</italic> (<italic>Avr</italic>) gene product in a gene-for-gene manner (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In addition to the HR-induced cell death, a class of lesion-mimic (<italic>Les</italic>/<italic>les</italic>) mutants is ubiquitous in plants, characterized by misregulated cell death phenotypes that mimic the HR. Unlike the HR, the <italic>Les</italic>/<italic>les</italic> mutant spontaneously forms lesions in the absence of any injuries, stresses, or pathogen infections (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Neuffer and Calvert, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Walbot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>). A large number of lesion-mimic mutants have been isolated in higher plants, and some have been characterized in detail. Lesion mimics are sometimes associated with enhanced disease resistance, including elevated expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and other markers that are indicative of defence system activation (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Wolter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">So far, many genes that are responsible for lesion-mimic phenotypes have been identified. Some of these genes encode enzymes that are involved in chlorophyll metabolism. Maize mutants deficient in <italic>les22</italic>, which encodes a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of chlorophyll and heme, develop minute necrotic spots on leaves from the accumulation of photo-excitable uroporphyrin (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In addition to the chlorophyll synthesis mutants, the <italic>Arabidopsis acd2</italic> mutant defective in the red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR), which can break down red chlorophyll catabolites (RCCs) <italic>in vitro</italic>, exhibits a light-dependent lesion phenotype due to the excessive accumulation of phototoxic RCCs (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Matile <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Mach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> oxygenase (PaO) catalyses the oxygenation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic>. It is an important chlorophyll breakdown enzyme. PaO was first cloned from maize under the name <italic>ZmLls1</italic> with two conserved motifs, namely a Rieske-type centre and a mononuclear non-heme Fe-binding site, which make it resemble aromatic ring-hydroylating dioxygenases (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The absence of <italic>ZmLls1</italic> in maize resulted in a chloroplast-mediated cell death phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) that was influenced by light (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Close <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), physical wounding (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and pathogen attack (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Obanni <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, the maize <italic>lls1</italic> mutant exhibited elevated resistance to fungal pathogens at the leaf epidermis by reducing the lesion ratio and/or causing fungal sterility. Meanwhile, plants with <italic>lls1</italic>-type lesions accumulate high levels of PR1 and chitinase proteins (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Simmons <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Cell death is more likely to be triggered in the <italic>lls1</italic> mutant through the accumulation of phototoxic pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> than by interfering with the cell death suppression mechanism (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accelerated cell death 1 (<italic>ACD1</italic>) gene, which is similar to PaO, is involved in the oxygenation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> and breaks down chlorophyll (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Pru&#x17E;insk&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In comparison with the <italic>lls1</italic> mutant, an excessive amount of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> is accumulated when chlorophyll breakdown occurs in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> As-<italic>ACD1</italic> plants, and cell death is induced under both darkness and illumination. Therefore, it appears that the accumulation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> not only enhances the oxidation of cellular components but also functions as a signal molecule or is able to inhibit a specific enzyme that induces cell death (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition to PaO mutants in maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, knockdown of <italic>OsPAO</italic> in rice results in the accumulation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> and triggers cell death in rice seedlings. <italic>OsPAO</italic> is constitutively expressed in rice plants but induced by natural senescence and physical wounding (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">PaO has been shown to be a suppressor of cell death in plants as a consequence of its catalytic activity in chlorophyll degradation, but the exact mechanism of cell death as regulated by PaO remains elusive. In this study, we isolated one wheat PaO homologue and characterized its function in cell death and disease resistance to <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>). We showed that the wheat <italic>lethal leaf-spot 1</italic> gene, <italic>TaLls1</italic>, was wound inducible. In the <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown lines, silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> led to leaf cell death, suggesting a cell death suppressor role of <italic>TaLls1</italic>. Meanwhile, cell death was triggered in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-overexpressed wheat and tobacco leaves, which further proved a positive correlation of cell death and TaLls1 accumulation. Thereby, we presumed a rheostat role of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in cell death regulation with a delicate threshold to maintain cell homeostasis in adaption to various stress. Deletion mutant analyses revealed that the conserved Rieske domain in the TaLls1 protein was essential for the cell death induction in overexpressing leaves. Furthermore, during the wheat&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> interaction, <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants exhibited reduced susceptibility to virulent stripe rust fungus. Our results demonstrated a negative regulation of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> and provide new insight for a role of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in cell death regulation, not only as a cell death suppressor.</p>

The plant growth conditions and inoculation of <italic>Pst</italic> were operated as described by <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Li (1984)</xref>. To study <italic>TaLls1</italic> expression levels in wheat leaves that were infected by <italic>Pst</italic> CYR31 or CYR23, leaf tissues were sampled at 0, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120h post-inoculation (p.i.).

        <p>To determine whether the silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> could result in lesion mimicking, the phenotype of the BSMV-infected wheat plants without <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation was continually observed until 6 weeks after virus inoculation. Segments of the fourth wheat leaves infected with BSMV were detached and stained with 0.5% Evans blue (Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) as described by <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> to identify the dead cells. Plants inoculated with BSMV:00 were used as controls. Eighteen seedlings were examined for each assay. Ten fields of view for each assay were observed, and three biological replications were performed. The cell death areas in each field were calculated with DP-BSW software, and Tukey&#x2019;s test was used for statistical analysis.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, the fourth leaves of <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown seedlings exhibited mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms but no lesion formation. From the fourth leaves to the seventh leaves, mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms were constantly observed and no lesion-mimic formation was detected. Although no macroscopic lesion formations were observed, cell death was detected by Evans blue staining, whereby the dead cells were stained dark blue. The fourth leaves infected with recombinant BSMV showed a darker blue staining than those infected with BSMV:00 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Microscopic observation of the stained leaf segments revealed more dead cells stained dark blue in leaves infected with BSMV:TaLls1-as (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>) and BSMV: TaLls1-as1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>) than those infected with BSMV:00 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have reported on the identification and functional analysis of a novel wheat <italic>Lls1</italic> gene, which is homologous to PaO in maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <italic>ZmLls1</italic> was wound inducible in maize (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and our qRT-PCR results also indicated the induction of <italic>TaLls1</italic> upon wounding treatment. <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Giridhar and Thimann (1985)</xref> reported that wounding promotes chlorophyll loss in oat leaves, so we inferred that the elevated <italic>TaLls1</italic> expression is responsible for the quick removal of chlorophyll in damaged cells. As for the decreased expression of <italic>TaLls1</italic> under cold treatments, this may be associated with dampened PaO activity in the breakdown of chlorophyll. During seed development in canola, freezing delays the degradation of chlorophyll due to a reduced PaO activity (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Chung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Our data suggest a regulated activity of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in response to abiotic stresses, which may be related to its catalytic activity in chlorophyll breakdown.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">During chlorophyll breakdown, chlorophyll is degraded to safe linear tetrapyrroles through a series of reactions catalysed by chlorophyllase, magnesium dechelatase, and PaO. PaO catalyses the oxygenic ring opening of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> between C4 and C5 to RCCs (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Pru&#x17E;insk&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). To clarify whether TaLls1 has this oxygenase activity, we assessed the content of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants. HPLC analyses revealed that pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> accumulated due to the silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants, implying that <italic>TaLls1</italic> has PaO activity.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Accompanied by the accumulation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic>, silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> caused a significant increase in cell death, indicating a cell death suppressor role of <italic>TaLls1</italic>, as observed for <italic>ZmLls1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) and <italic>Arabidopsis acd1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). It has been reported that pheophorbide <italic>a,</italic> the substrate of PaO, accumulates and generates reactive oxygen species under light conditions, which lead to cell death (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Pru&#x17E;insk&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Thus, we infer that, in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants, the reduced activity of TaLls1 resulted in the accumulation of pheophorbide <italic>a</italic>, which would induce further cell death owing to the simulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. However, despite this phototoxic feature, pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> has been assumed to specifically inhibit the activity of channel proteins or other cellular components that are essential for membrane integrity and to cause the destruction of membrane systems (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition, pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> has also been postulated to function as a signal molecule that regulates gene expression and induces programmes cell death (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we confirmed the cell death suppressor role of TaLls1, but the detailed mechanism of the cell death caused by pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> needs to be investigated further. Different from the lesion-mimic phenotype observed in <italic>ZmLls1</italic> mutants, <italic>TaLls1</italic> silencing was insufficient to cause visible necrosis in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants, which may due to the complicated regulatory mechanisms of plant cell death. In addition, the deficiency caused by <italic>TaLls1</italic> silencing may be complemented by other genes with a similar function in wheat or genes from other pathways. Nevertheless, <italic>TaLls1</italic> was demonstrated to partially contribute to cell death in wheat.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Although <italic>ZmLls1</italic>, <italic>AtAcd1</italic>, and <italic>OsPAO</italic> potentially are cell death suppressors according to the results of mutant and silencing assays (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Pru&#x17E;insk&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), there is still no direct overexpression evidence for its role in cell death. Interestingly, in this study, the transient expression of <italic>TaLls1</italic> also could induce cell death in both tobacco and wheat leaves instead of a cell death suppressor. In order to further determine the cause of this, we assessed the content of RCCs, which are the product of PaO, and found an accumulation of RCCs in wheat leaves overexpressing <italic>TaLls1</italic>. Previous studies have indicated that accumulation of RCCs is responsible for cell death in <italic>acd2</italic> mutant and <italic>OsRCCRi</italic> rice plants (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Pru&#x17E;insk&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is generated together with the accumulation of RCCs, which play an important role in <italic>acd2</italic>-induced cell death (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Yao and Greenberg, 2006</xref>). Thus, we inferred that it was H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation by RCC accumulation that induced cell death in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-overexpressing wheat leaves. Here, our findings provide direct evidence of the correlation between cell death and PaO.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Taken together, the cell death induction activity of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in either <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants or transient overexpressing leaf tissues demonstrated the close relationship of cell death and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation caused by the chlorophyll degradation catabolites resulting from the irregular TaLls1 activity. It appears that there is a threshold for <italic>TaLls1</italic> in maintaining the balance of chlorophyll catabolism and cell homeostasis. In sum, <italic>TaLls1</italic> seems to serve as a type of rheostat for cell death regulation in plants subjected to various stresses.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">A deletion mutational analysis of the conserved structures revealed that Rieske [2Fe-2S] is responsible for cell death induction, while the mononuclear non-heme iron-binding domain was not. Previous reports have demonstrated that both the Rieske [2Fe-2S] and mononuclear non-heme iron-binding domains are essential for PaO catalytic activity (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Ferraro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), during which the electrons transfer from the Rieske domain to the active sites and subsequently activate the PaO activity (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). For the both truncated TaLls1 forms (TaLls1<sub>212&#x2013;397</sub> and TaLls1<sub>212&#x2013;397</sub>), the oxygenase catalytic activity was unable to be activated. Thereby, we presume that it is not only the catalytic activity of TaLls1 that caused the induced cell death but other roles of TaLls1 produced by Rieske [2Fe-2S]. With the exception of their function as electron carriers in the photosynthetic electron transport chain and as electron donors to various cellular proteins, the iron&#x2013;sulphur clusters were also found to serve a variety of biological functions, including regulatory and structural roles (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Beinert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). In the redox-sensing SoxR protein, the FeS centres allosterically link cellular oxidative stress to the expression of defence-related genes (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). It has also been reported that the [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding site is involved in mitochondrial morphology and suppression of cell proliferation (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Murata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Taken together, we speculate that the cell death induction activity may be related to other functions of TaLls1, such as a signal molecule in the cell death pathway or an electron transporter for other enzymes involved in cell death, rather than breaking down pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> alone.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">After confirming the linkage between <italic>TaLls1</italic> and cell death, we further studied the role of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in the wheat&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> interaction. <italic>TaLls1</italic> was upregulated with the avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> pathogen infection at 12h p.i., when the pathogen had not yet formed haustoria (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Our result is consistent with the induced expression of the <italic>Lls1</italic> gene in the cowpea and cowpea rust interaction (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Mould <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). These authors demonstrated that upregulation of PaO during the cowpea and cowpea rust interaction may reflect an anticipation of chlorophyll degradation related to HR (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Mould <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). For the wheat&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> interaction, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> reported that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rapidly increased at infection sites 12h after inoculation of avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> before HR, so we postulated that the early increase in <italic>TaLls1</italic> in the incompatible interaction is associated with the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at an early stage of HR initiation.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">To get more information on the role of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in the wheat&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> interaction, <italic>TaLls1</italic> was silenced through a BSMV-mediated gene silencing system. The <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants exhibited no detectable change in disease symptoms, but did show a significant increase in cell death upon <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Generally, elevated cell death occurrence at the infection sites was proposed to inhibit the spread of pathogen infection, but growth of the virulent <italic>Pst</italic> CYR31 did not significantly change in <italic>TaLls</italic>1-knockdown plants in comparison with the control plants. It is reasonable to speculate that silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> is able to increase cell death caused by <italic>Pst</italic> infection but insufficient to limit <italic>Pst</italic> growth. Aside from the significant upregulation of <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>PR2</italic>, and <italic>PAL</italic> in response to <italic>Pst</italic> infection in the <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants, the <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants exhibited a sharply increased accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the early stage of the virulent pathogen infection. Notably, the amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown leaves in the compatible interaction reached approximately the same level as in the incompatible interactions, which is sufficient to trigger local cell death. During the interaction between wheat and the avirulent <italic>Pst</italic>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in the early infection stage is associated with the occurrence of HR and the resistance response (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we assume that knockdown of <italic>TaLls1</italic> is likely to result in HR elicitation during the compatible interaction at the early stage. Additionally, catalase and superoxidase are subsequently upregulated to eliminate the excessive H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the removal of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may lead to the failure of HR initiation. Hence, <italic>TaLls1</italic>-knockdown plants seemed to be susceptible to the virulent <italic>Pst</italic>. When combined with the induced cell death and elevated expression levels of defence-related genes, it is reasonable to assume that silencing of <italic>TaLls1</italic> enhanced the tolerance of wheat to <italic>Pst</italic> but was not sufficient to alter the disease symptoms.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In conclusion, the present study revealed a self-regulation of <italic>TaLls1</italic> in balancing cell death and a negative role in wheat disease tolerance to <italic>Pst</italic>, but it is not clear how they are related. Further studies of <italic>TaLls1</italic>-modulated HR resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> are needed with transgenic wheat plants.</p>
