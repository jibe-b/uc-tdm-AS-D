      <abstract>
        <p>Avenin-like b proteins are a small family of wheat storage proteins, each containing 18 or 19 cysteine residues. The role of these proteins, with high numbers of cysteine residues, in determining the functional properties of wheat flour is unclear. In the present study, two transgenic lines of the bread wheat overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene were generated to investigate the effects of Avenin-like b proteins on dough mixing properties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation (SDSS) test and Mixograph analysis of these lines demonstrated that overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins in both transgenic wheat lines significantly increased SDSS volume and improved dough elasticity, mixing tolerance and resistance to extension. These changes were associated with the increased proportion of polymeric proteins due to the incorporation of overexpressed Avenin-like b proteins into the glutenin polymers. The results of this study were critical to confirm the hypothesis that Avenin-like b proteins could be integrated into glutenin polymers by inter-chain disulphide bonds, which could help understand the mechanism behind strengthening wheat dough strength.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Wheat is currently an important human food resource that can be processed into a range of foods such as breads, cakes, biscuits, pastas and noodles. The ability of wheat to be processed into such a wide range of foods stems from its particular ability to form cohesive dough. The key component of dough is gluten proteins, which can form a continuous viscoelastic protein network within the dough and confer elasticity and viscosity to the dough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Bushuk1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry1">[2]</xref>. The major gluten proteins are gliadins and glutenins. Monomeric gliadins are considered as single polypeptides with slight differences in molecular weight in the flour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Mller1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Mller2">[4]</xref>. Glutenins, on the other hand, have a wide range of molecular weights and contain high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low-molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS). These glutenins can form the high molecular mass glutenin polymers and largely contribute to wheat dough strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Payne1">[5]</xref>. The different properties contributed by gliadins and glutenins to dough quality are determined by the difference in the number and position of cysteine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry2">[6]</xref>. In general, gliadins form only intra-chain disulfide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Mller1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Mller2">[4]</xref>, while glutenin subunits can form both intra- and inter-chain disulfide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry3">[7]</xref>. The widely-held view of gluten structure was summarized by Shewry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry3">[7]</xref> who suggested a structural model for wheat gluten, in which the HMW subunits crosslink with each other in a head-to-tail fashion by inter-chain disulphide bonds and form an &#x2018;elastic backbone&#x2019;, while LMW subunits crosslink to this backbone basis and form &#x2018;branches&#x2019;. These elastic backbone formed by HMW subunit with the branches formed by the LMW subunit are the glutenin polymers. Gliadins may also interact with the glutenin polymers by strong covalent and non-covalent forces and contribute to gluten viscosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry1">[2]</xref>. In this model, the HMW-GS plays a determinant role in dough strength. This was confirmed in many studies that analyzed the functional properties of near-isogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Popineau1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Takata1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Deng1">[10]</xref> and transgenic wheat lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Altpeter1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Barro1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Barro2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-He1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Blechl1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Wang1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Len1">[17]</xref>. In addition, several studies also used transgenic wheat lines to demonstrate that LMW glutenin subunits were also important determinants of quality in processed wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Payne2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Pogna1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Ruitz1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Tosi1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Further, a new class of wheat storage proteins named Avenin-like proteins was recently identified with its function still unknown. Kan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref> reported two new classes of cDNAs expressed specifically in seed endosperm of wheat and named the encoded proteins a-type and b-type Avenin-like proteins. These Avenin-like proteins were also detected in the glutenin fraction of durum wheat cultivar, Svevo, and considered to be seed storage proteins by the anthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Mamone1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-DeCaro1">[24]</xref>. The distinguishing feature of these seed storage proteins was that they included high numbers of cysteine residues. Avenin-like a-type protein, with a molecular mass of about 18 kDa, contains 14 cysteine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>. Based on the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues in the proteins from different species and its high sequence homology to &#x2018;low-molecular weight gliadin&#x2019; monomer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Anderson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Clarke1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Salcedo1">[27]</xref>, it is presumable that cysteine residues of Avenin-like a protein mediate seven intra-chain disulfide bonds. The mature Avenin-like b-type proteins with a molecular mass of about 30 kDa contained 18 or 19 cysteine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>. The variation in the number and position of the cysteine residues in the N- and C-terminal domains of the b-type proteins indicated that some of these cysteine residues could be involved in inter-chain disulphide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>. This raised the question whether this class of cysteine-rich proteins played a role in determining the functional properties of wheat. In addition, we were also interested in investigating their possible involvement in determining dough strength.</p>
      <p>In our previous study, we isolated and characterized twenty-three Avenin-like b genes from wheat and related species and suggested that they were a new class of proteins different from gliadins and glutenins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Chen1">[28]</xref>. Expression pattern of the <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene was seed endosperm-specific and observed between 3 and 22 DPA (days post anthesis) with a peak between 11 and 15 DPA in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Chen1">[28]</xref>. This expression pattern was similar to the expression pattern of gliadin and glutenin genes in developing wheat seeds. In a subsequent study, incorporation of purified Avenin-like b proteins, produced <italic>in vitro</italic>, into wheat flour revealed a positive correlation between Avenin-like b proteins and dough strength by 2 g Mixograph tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Chen2">[29]</xref>. In the present study, two transgenic wheat lines overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene were generated by particle bombardment to study the influence of Avenin-like b proteins on the functional properties of wheat flour. The results showed that overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins in transgenic wheat lines had a positive impact on dough Mixograph parameters and provided the evidence for incorporated of Avenin-like b proteins into gluten polymers.</p>

        <p>In this study, the sequence of <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene was 855 bp long (GenBank accession number HM027637) and encoded a protein with 284 amino acid residues containing 18 cysteine residues. This predicted protein belonged to Avenin-like b (typ-b3) protein according to the results reported by Kan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>.

The phylogenetic relationships of Avenin-like b proteins were analyzed in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Chen2">[29]</xref>. Immature scutella from the wheat cultivar Emai 12 were used as targets for transformation by particle bombardment. Both transgene Avenin-like b proteins from cv. Zhengmai 9023 (GenBank accession number: HM027637) and endogenous Avenin-like b proteins from cv. Emai 12 (GenBank accession number: HM027635) contained 18 cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066758.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, the positions of all cysteine residues in both Avenin-like b proteins were consistent with an exception of one nucleotide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066758.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Plasmid pAHC25 conferring bialaphos resistance and plasmid pLRPT-avel containing the target <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene were used for transformation of the wheat variety Emai 12.</p>

        <p>After analyzing five generations (T<sub>0</sub>&#x2013;T<sub>4</sub>) for the presence and expression of transgene by PCR, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis, two homozygous transgenic wheat lines in T<sub>4</sub> generation overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene were obtained while the other tested transgenic lines were hemizygous. Two T<sub>4</sub> homozygous transgenic plant lines (designated E-3 and E-5) together with the non-transgenic line (designated N-1) derived from T<sub>1</sub> hemizygous plants and non-transformed control Emai 12 plants were grown in the experimental field of the Chinese National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan) HUST Part (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China). The E-3 and E-5 transgenic lines were derived from the T<sub>0</sub> plants in lane 3 and lane 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), respectively. T<sub>5</sub> seeds were harvested separately from each transgenic line and analyzed by PCR, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis to verify homozygosity and stability of transgene expression. Seeds from the two transgenic lines, one non-transgenic control line and one non-transformed control line were separately harvested and used for all subsequent analyses such as SDSS test and Mixograph analysis.</p>

        <title>Detection of Avenin-like b Protein in Seeds of Transgenic and Control Plants</title>
        <p>The pET-32a-avel vector containing the coding region of <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene, without the signal peptide sequence, was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and induced with isopropyl-&#x3B2;-D-Thiogalactoside (IPTG) for recombinant protein expression. The proteins were then purified by affinity chromatography using His-columns because the recombinant protein contained a His-tag protein at the N-terminus. SDS-PAGE of total proteins extracted from the induced cells showed the expressed recombinant protein to be 50 kDa along with the 20 kDa trx A protein and His-Tag protein fused at the N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shen1">[38]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066758.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, the size of the expressed Avenin-like b protein was predicted to be 30 kDa, which was consistent with the molecular mass of the mature Avenin-like b protein encoded by the <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the renatured heterologously expressed Avenin-like b proteins were also specific to Avenin-like b proteins in the wheat seeds as analyzed by Western blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066758.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate the levels of Avenin-like b proteins in the transgenic and control lines, total proteins were extracted and fractionated on SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Staining of the total proteins separated on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue allowed the identification of transgenic subunits in wheat lines E-3 and E-5 overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Because of the high sensitivity of Western blotting analysis, it was possible to more accurately identify the Avenin-like b proteins expressed in the wheat grain. In our study, a clear reactive band of the expected molecular mass (about 30 kDa) was observed in all seed protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The relative amounts of Avenin-like b proteins in the transgenic wheat lines were measured by using GAPDH as control to normalize for equal amounts of proteins and to calculate the relative amount. These amounts were then compared to the non-transformed control lines. In the transgenic E-3 and E-5 lines, the relative amounts of Avenin-like b proteins increased to 1.46- and 1.53-times, respectively when compared to the non-transformed line, as calculated by densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, significant differences were not observed in the amounts of Avenin-like b proteins expressed between the non-transgenic line (N-1) and non-transformed control line (Emai 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <p>To compare the protein compositions between flour samples from the transgenic and control lines, we separated and quantified glutenins and gliadins. The Glutenin % (quantity of the glutenins expressed relative to total proteins) varied slightly from 38.6% to 38.2% in line E-5 and Emai 12 control, while Gliadin % (quantity of the gliadins expressed relative to total proteins) was very similar in all lines (36.7% in E-5 and 36.5% in Emai 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Neither Glutenin % nor Gliadin % were significantly different between transgenic and control wheat lines as determined by ANOVA. SDS-PAGE analysis of total proteins showed no marked difference in the endogenous HMW-GS (1Dx2, 1Bx7, 1By8 and 1Dy12) subunits between the transgenic and control wheat lines. The proportions of HMW-GS in the glutenin varied from 18.7% in line E-5 to 19.1% in the Emai 12 control line, while those of LMW-GS ranged from 81.1% to 80.9% respectively. Furthermore, the ratios of HMW/LMW were similar among transgenic wheat lines (about 0.21) and control lines (about 0.22). In general, overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins in the transgenic lines did not alter the amounts and proportions of both HMW-GS and LMW-GS glutenins and gliadins in transgenic wheat endosperms.</p>

        <title>Incorporation of the Avenin-like b Proteins into the Glutenin Polymers</title>
        <p>The Avenin-like b proteins, analyzed in this study, contained 18 cysteine residues hypothesized to form inter-chain disulphide bonds thus allowing incorporation into high molecular mass polymers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>. To confirm this hypothesis, sequential extraction of monomeric and polymeric proteins from the transgenic (E-3 and E-5) and non-transgenic (N-1) lines was carried out as described by Tosi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Tosi2">[31]</xref>. The soluble fraction extracted with SDS phosphate buffer contains both monomers and oligomers while the insoluble fraction contains only polymers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Tosi2">[31]</xref>. Equal amounts of reduced and unreduced extracts were loaded on SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by Western blotting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g004">Figure 4A</xref> showed no significant differences in the reduced and unreduced extracts of monomers and oligomers, and the reduced extracts of polymers between the transgenic (E-3 and E-5) and non-transgenic (N-1) line.</p>

        <p>Western blotting results of unreduced samples showed only trace amounts of monomers (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), which migrated slightly faster than the reduced polymers. This could be due to its more compact conformation because of the presence of intra-chain disulphide bonds similar to the results reported by Tosi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Tosi2">[31]</xref>. In addition, comparison of the Western blotting results obtained with unreduced and reduced samples indicated the present of higher amounts of Avenin-like b proteins in oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, it was also more abundant in the polymer protein fraction (grey arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) compared to the monomers. Therefore, it was evident that Avenin-like b proteins were predominantly present as both oligomers and polymers. The oligomers detected in the unreduced fractions could be a conformation of the Avenin-like b proteins, and could possibly contain other storage proteins. The unreduced oligomers might also have a more compact conformation determined by the presence of intra-chain disulphide bonds. However, intensity of the bands corresponding to the reduced monomers and oligomers decreased when compared to the corresponding unreduced monomers and oligomers. This was most likely because polyclonal antibodies were raised against the renatured Avenin-like b proteins and could recognize the unreduced conformation better than the reduced one.</p>
        <p>In our study, significant differences were not observed in the amounts of Avenin-like b proteins in the monomers and oligomers between the non-transgenic (N-1) and transgenic (E-3 and E-5) lines. However, the amounts of Avenin-like b proteins in the polymers were significantly higher in the transgenic (E-3 and E-5) lines compared to the non-transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Especially in transgenic line E-5, Avenin-like b proteins in the polymers were much more abundant than that in transgenic line E-3. These results indicated that extra Avenin-like b proteins in transgenic wheat lines were presumably incorporated into the polymers.</p>
        <p>Effects of the transgenes on the proportions of unextractable polymeric proteins (%UPP) were determined by sequential extraction and SE-HPLC using the method described by Tosi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Tosi1">[21]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0066758-t001">Table 1</xref>, a drastic difference was observed in the %UPP, which was higher in E-3 (34.35%) and E-5 (35.08%) lines when compared to N-1 (25.61%) and Emai 12 (24.96%) lines. Both transgenic lines had higher %UPP values, indicating higher proportions of glutenin polymers in these lines.</p>

Heights of the curve after peak resistance remained stable at 43% torque in lines E-3 and E-5, whereas in the Emai 12 it decreased to 34% torque. Moreover, significant increase in bandwidth values (MLW, MPW, MRW and MTxW) was observed in transgenic wheat (E-3 and E-5) lines demonstrating that the dough resistance to extension was improved in transgenic lines overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene. In addition, overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins also reduced the weakening slope (WS). However, this decrease was greater in transgenic line E-5 (7.74%) compared to the control line (10.54%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0066758-t001">Table 1</xref>). MPT and MTxI values in both E-3 and E-5 lines were significantly higher than the control lines. MPT in transgenic wheat line E-3 and E-5 increased to 3.62 min and 3.74 min, respectively, compared to 2.85 min in non-transformed wheat lines. More importantly, MTxI values in the E-3 and E-5 lines were also significantly higher compared to control lines, suggesting stronger dough from the flour obtained from E-3 and E-5 lines compared to the control lines.</p>

We have clearly demonstrated that all transgenic lines that tested PCR positive (PCR analysis) for the presence of CaMV35S terminator were also positive for transgene expression, determined using the anti-avenin-like b proteins polyclonal antibody. After selection for four consecutive years, two homozygous transgenic lines overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene (designated E-3 and E-5), one non-transgenic line (designated N-1) and one non-transformed control line (cv.

        <p>In this study, we characterized both protein compositions and dough mixing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Because protein compositions played a critical role in dough functionality, we first determined the differences in protein compositions between transgenic and control wheat lines. Amounts of flour protein in the transgenic lines were higher than in control lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0066758-t001">Table 1</xref>), although this increase was non-significant. Moreover, differences in the amounts of glutenins and gliadins were observed between transgenic and control wheat lines, but these differences were also not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). The lack of significant difference in protein compositions could be due to the low expression levels of Avenin-like b proteins in the endosperms of bread wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Mamone1">[23]</xref>. Despite an increase in the relative amounts of Avenin-like b proteins in the transgenic E-3 (1.46-times) and E-5 (1.53-times) lines when compared to the non-transformed control line, the proportion of Avenin-like b proteins among the storage protein in transgenic wheat lines was still low compared to glutenins and gliadins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins in the transgenic lines did not result in significantly changes in the amounts and proportions of glutenins (including both HMW-GS and LMW-GS) and gliadins in the transgenic wheat endosperms.</p>
        <p>The SDSS test and Mixograph are small-scale tests used to analyze dough gluten strength and mixing properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Lorenzo1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Martinant1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Carter1">[41]</xref>, which showed significant increases in the average SDSS volume observed in the transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0066758-t001">Table 1</xref>). These values showed that the transgenic lines had better quality than the control lines. High SDSS volumes have been shown to be associated with stronger gluten and superior bread-making quality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Lorenzo1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Ayoub1">[42]</xref>. Mixing properties of transgenic lines analyzed using the 10-g Mixograph provided information on dough strength, which closely correlated with baking quality. Relationships between Mixograph parameters and dough viscoelasticity have been studied in details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Martinant1">[40]</xref> and associations of these parameters with other wheat quality traits were also discussed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Bordes1">[43]</xref>. In general, MPW and MRW positively correlated with dough resistance to extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Tosi1">[21]</xref>, whereas WS and MTxW negatively and positively correlated with tolerance to over-mixing, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Martinant1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Piston1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Li1">[45]</xref>. Parameters of the curve height values (MLV, MPV, MRV and MTxV) positively correlated with dough elasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Lorenzo1">[39]</xref>. MPT, MPV and MTxI also positively correlated with dough strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Len1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Li1">[45]</xref>. In general, weaker dough has higher WS, shorter MPT, lower MPV and smaller MTxI when compared to stronger dough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Len1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Li1">[45]</xref>. In our study, significant differences in mixing parameters were not observed between the non-transgenic (N-1) line and non-transformed wheat control line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g006">Figure 6</xref>) demonstrating the nearly identical patterns of storage proteins in N-1 line when compared to the transformed control line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This result met the expectation that the genetic transformation process did not caused any variations in storage proteins in N-1 line.</p>

        <p>We further compared the mixing parameters between transgenic lines (lines E-3 and E-5), non-transgenic line (N-1) and non-transformed control line (cv. Emai 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In transgenic lines, a significant increase in all parameters related to the curve heights demonstrated an increase in dough elasticity. Significantly lower WS values and higher MTxW values in E-3 and E-5 lines revealed an improved mixing tolerance because of the overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins. In addition, a significant increase in all mixing parameters related to curve widths in the transgenic lines when compared to control lines demonstrated that dough resistance to extension was also improved. Further, increase in MPT, MPV and MTxI in lines E-3 and E-5 indicated the enhancement of dough strength in the transgenic lines in comparison with the control lines. From these results, it could be concluded that overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins generally led to improve dough elasticity, mixing tolerance and dough resistance to extension. These results were also consistent with our previous report that the direct addition of Avenin-like b proteins into flour resulted in statistically significant increases in peak resistance and mixing tolerance in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Chen2">[29]</xref>, indicating that Avenin-like b proteins had advantageous effects on mixing properties of wheat flour.</p>
        <p>In addition, significant differences were observed in MLW, MRW and WS between the two transgenic wheat lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These differences had quantity effect on the dough quality because of the different expression levels of Avenin-like b proteins in the two transgenic wheat lines. These results were consistent with the results of Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Chen2">[29]</xref> who reported that the incorporation 15 mg Avenin-like b proteins into the flour had larger effect on mixing properties than 10 mg as shown <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggested that the effect of Avenin-like b protein on dough quality could be enhanced with an increase in the quantity of this protein.</p>

        <title>Incorporation of Transgenic Subunit into the Glutenin Polymers</title>
        <p>Both the amount and size distribution of polymeric proteins have been shown to be important and their contributions to baking performance have been extensively studied and documented throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Popineau1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Barro2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Gupta1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Piroz1">[46]</xref>. Moreover, a certain amount of these polymers remains unextractable (UPP) in various extracting systems (e.g. SDS phosphate buffer or acetic acid solution) and the proportion of the unextractable polymeric protein (%UPP) fraction is reported to be related to the rheological properties of wheat flour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Gupta1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Lorenzo1">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The Avenin-like b proteins, analyzed in this study, contained 18 cysteine residues speculated to form intra-chain and inter-chain disulphide bonds indicating that they could be integrated into glutenin polymers to alter the functional properties of wheat flour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>. To confirm this hypothesis, monomeric subunits, small oligomers and polymers were extracted and analyzed which showed that Avenin-like b proteins existed predominantly in both oligomer and polymer proteins rather than in monomeric fraction. Moreover, the amounts of Avenin-like b proteins in the polymers were higher in the transgenic (E-3 and E-5) lines compared to the non-transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066758-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Based on these results, it was reasonable to conclude that in transgenic plants Avenin-like b proteins were indeed incorporated into the glutenin polymers. This observation was also supported by the high proportion of unextractable polymeric protein (%UPP), which represents a way to measure polymer size distribution, in the transgenic wheat lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0066758-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results demonstrated that the improvement of flour properties in the transgenic wheat lines were associated with an increased proportion of polymer proteins. It could be postulated that the overexpressed Avenin-like b proteins can affect the formation of endogenous protein network and impact on the cross-linking of glutenin monomers <italic>via</italic> inter-chain disulphide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Kan1">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, in cereals, the formation of disulfide bonds appears to increase structural stability of the folded conformation and to decrease solubility of storage proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry5">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Joudrier1">[48]</xref>. Both of these features provide protection against proteolysis which might be related to seed dormancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Shewry5">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Joudrier1">[48]</xref>. The biological role of storage proteins, in fact, is to act as a source of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur for germination and seedling growth through storage proteolysis in cereal plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Joudrier1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Li2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Wong1">[50]</xref>. When conditions are favourable for germination, the disulfide bonds of storage proteins are reduced by a regulatory disulfide protein Thioredoxin which could reduce the disulfide bonds of storage proteins, thereby increasing the susceptibility to proteolysis of storage proteins and facilitating germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Li2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Wong1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Wong2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Marx1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066758-Montrichard1">[53]</xref>. As discussed above, overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins could significantly affect on the proportion of polymeric gluten proteins by inter-chain disulphide bonds and might have a function for seed physiology during dormancy and germination.</p>
        <p>This is the first report on producing transgenic lines overexpressing <italic>avenin-like b</italic> gene and the first evidence for the positive effect of Avenin-like b proteins on dough mixing properties of wheat. This study is also the first to confirm the incorporation of Avenin-like b proteins into the gluten polymers in wheat by inter-chain disulphide bonds. These results essentially extended our knowledge of the role of Avenin-like b proteins in determining the functionality of bread wheat, which should help understand the influence and mechanism of Avenin-like b proteins on the quality of wheat flour. The <italic>avenin-ike b</italic> gene could be an excellent candidate gene to improve the functional properties of wheat. It would be of interest to determine whether the Avenin-like b proteins with different compositions of gluten proteins or in different genotypes could have different effects on the functional properties of dough, and whether the variation in the number and/or the positions of cysteine residues in Avenin-like b proteins could have different effect on mixing properties of dough. Additional studies are required to better understand the role of Avenin-like b proteins in functional properties of wheat flour and their possible biological meaning (e.g. role in grain development and seed germination).</p>
