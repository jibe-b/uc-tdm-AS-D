      <abstract>
        <p>WRKY transcription factors are reported to be involved in defense regulation, stress response and plant growth and development. However, the precise role of WRKY transcription factors in abiotic stress tolerance is not completely understood, especially in crops. In this study, we identified and cloned 10 WRKY genes from genome of wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.). <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>, a gene induced by multiple stresses, was selected for further investigation. <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> was upregulated by treatment with polyethylene glycol, NaCl, cold and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Result of Southern blot indicates that the wheat genome contains three copies of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>. The TaWRKY10 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional activator. Overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L.) resulted in enhanced drought and salt stress tolerance, mainly demonstrated by the transgenic plants exhibiting of increased germination rate, root length, survival rate, and relative water content under these stress conditions. Further investigation showed that transgenic plants also retained higher proline and soluble sugar contents, and lower reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde contents. Moreover, overexpression of the <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> regulated the expression of a series of stress related genes. Taken together, our results indicate that TaWRKY10 functions as a positive factor under drought and salt stresses by regulating the osmotic balance, ROS scavenging and transcription of stress related genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Environmental stresses, including drought, salinity and low temperature, are the primary causes of declines in crop yield and quality worldwide. To combat these challenges, plants have evolved sophisticated molecular networks resulting in adaptive responses through physiological and morphological changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Bohnert1">[1]</xref>. The adaptive responses commonly use transcriptional activation or repression of genes upon signal perception and transduction of the external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Yang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Wang1">[3]</xref>. Plant adaptability is mainly operated by the regulation of various transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Pandey1">[4]</xref>. Significant progress has been made in understanding the genes response to various stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Hasegawa1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Reddy1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Zhu1">[7]</xref>, and numerous transcription factors and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in plants have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Xiong1">[8]</xref>. Among them, the plant WRKY transcription factors, comprising a large family of regulatory proteins, are shown to play an important role in response to various stresses.</p>
      <p>Since the first WRKY transcription factor was characterized from sweet potato (<italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Ishiguro1">[9]</xref>, many WRKY proteins have been identified from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), poplar (<italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>), pinus (<italic>Pinus monticola</italic>) and <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>. The characteristic feature of the WRKY family is its highly conserved 60 amino acids, the WRKY domain, which is comprised of a highly conserved WRKYGQK motif at the N-terminus and certain zinc finger motifs at C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Latchman1">[10]</xref>. The WRKYGQK motif in various plant species show slight variations in the amino sequences (for example, WRKYGKK and WRKYGEK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Rushton1">[12]</xref>. Depending on their domain structures, the WRKY proteins can be divided into three different groups. Proteins with two WRKY domains belong to group I; proteins containing one WRKY domain belong to groups II or III, depending on the type of zinc finger motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Eulgem1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Proietti1">[14]</xref>. The WRKY factors present high binding affinity to a DNA <italic>cis</italic>-acting element named as the W box, (C/T)TGAC(T/C), which permits signal transduction to regulate the expressions of stress-related genes, resulting in plant stress tolerance finally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Eulgem1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During the process of plant evolution, the WRKY variations facilitate distinct cellular, developmental, and physiological roles. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the WRKY factors are central components of many aspects of the innate immune system of plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Eulgem2">[15]</xref>. In addition, the WRKY factors participate in certain physiological processes, including embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Ueda1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Lagace1">[17]</xref>, seed development and germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Jiang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Xie1">[19]</xref>, trichome development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Johnson1">[20]</xref>, biosynthetic pathways regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Guillaumie1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Wan1">[22]</xref> and hormone signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Antoni1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Makandar1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Chen1">[25]</xref>. Recently, attention has focused on biotic stress responsive WRKY transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Guillaumie1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Ishihama1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Mao1">[27]</xref>. However, less progress has been made on understanding the function of WRKY proteins in the abiotic stress, as compared with the biotic stresses research progress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Niu1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Wheat is the dominant crop for human food and livestock feed. Current and future concerns include improving wheat yield and quality under hostile environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Shewry1">[29]</xref>. Considering the diverse roles of WRKY transcription factors under complex environmental conditions, clarifying the functions of certain WRKY members in the abiotic stress response remains a challenge. Overexpression of <italic>WRKY</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Chen2">[30]</xref>, rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Song1">[31]</xref> and soybean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Zhou1">[32]</xref> conferred tolerance to abiotic stresses, especially oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Davletova1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Gadjev1">[34]</xref>. However, whether <italic>WRKYs</italic> confer drought and salt stress tolerance through reducing ROS accumulation is not yet to be determined in wheat. In the present study, based on the conserved protein sequence of WRKY transcription factors, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with high similarity to the <italic>WRKYs</italic> in wheat genome sequence database were analyzed, collected and assembled into several unigenes. Ten of the <italic>TaWRKYs</italic>, designated <italic>TaWRKY1</italic>&#x2013;<italic>TaWRKY10</italic>, were successfully identified. Among these genes, <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> was observed to confer drought and salt stress tolerance by regulating osmosis and reducing ROS accumulation.</p>

        <p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. cv. Chinese Spring) seeds were treated with 75% (v/v) ethanol for surface-sterilization and washed three times in distilled water. Seeds were germinated on distilled water and cultured in growth chambers (16 h light/8 h dark cycle with a light intensity of 200 &#xB5;mol&#xB7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xB7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at 25&#xB0;C) for ten days. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or NaCl treatment were conducted by transferring seedlings into Petri dishes containing 20% PEG6000 or 200 mM NaCl solutions, and incubated under light for 24 h. For cold treatment, seedlings were transferred to cold-chamber with a beaker containing water pre-cooled to 4&#xB0;C and maintained at 4&#xB0;C under light for 24 h. For treatment with signaling molecule, seedlings were sprayed with 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and incubated under light for 24 h. In all these treatments, wheat seedlings at similar growth states were used, and untreated wheat seedlings were taken as controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Zhou2">[35]</xref>. Leaf samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until RNA extraction. For tissue-specific expression analysis, the roots, stems and leaves of 10-day-old untreated seedlings were also collected.</p>

After searching for WRKY domains and eliminating repeats, 10 WRKY transcription factors were identified from wheat leaves, of which nine possessed a complete ORF.

        <p>The full-length <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> sequence was transformed into WT tobacco line. Seventeen independent TaWRKY10 overexpressing TG lines were obtained and confirmed by genomic PCR.

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> Enhances Tolerance to Mannitol, NaCl and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Treatments during Seed Germination and Root Elongation</title>
        <p>To evaluate the stress tolerance of the control and the TG tobacco lines, seed germination was examined. Seeds were sown on MS medium supplemented with appropriate concentrations of mannitol, NaCl or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Germination rates of WT seeds, VC seeds and TG seeds did not show any significant difference on normal MS medium (data not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, when seeds were germinated on 100 mM mannitol for 3 days, only 21.9% germination was seen in the WT line and 23.3% in the VC line, whereas the TG lines showed 50%&#x2013;70% germination. After 7 days of germination, only 84.3% of WT and 88.2% of VC seeds germinated, whereas at least 94.1% germination was observed in the three TG lines. Under mannitol stress, the percentage germination of WT was much lower compared with that of the TG over a 7-day period. When the seeds of WT, VC and TG lines were germinated in the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the TG lines germination rates (TG 1&#x2013;96.8%, TG 5&#x2013;94.9% and TG 7&#x2013;93.8%) were higher than those of WT plants (90.5%) and VC plants (91.5%). When the seeds were germinated on MS medium containing 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 days, the germination rates of TG seeds were significantly higher than the WT line and VC line. Only 22.6% of WT seeds and 20.1% of VC seeds germinated at day 2, compared with 38.9%, 39.0% and 32.4% of seeds hosting the <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, root elongation was tested under gradient NaCl, mannitol or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065120.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). As the concentration of NaCl increased, the root lengths of the control lines were significantly arrested, whereas the TG roots continued to grow. Under mannitol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments, the TG plants also showed more adaptation to stress compared with the control lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, the growth situation displayed little difference between the WT line and VC line grown on different medium. Thus, these results indicated that overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> in tobacco increased tolerance to mannitol, NaCl and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stresses during seed germination and root elongation.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> Enhances Drought and Salt Tolerance in Transgenic Tobacco Plants</title>
        <p>To characterize the performance of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> transgenic lines under drought and salt stress in soil, all three TG lines, and the controls, were tested at the seedling stage. Comparing with the control plants under normal conditions, the TG tobacco plants showed no obvious phenotypic difference in terms of appearance, flowering time or production. However, under stress conditions, the TG plants did show differences in performance. After drought treatment for 3 weeks, compared with TG plants, the WT plants were smaller and more withered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). After 3 weeks of exposure to 400 mM NaCl, most leaves of the TG tobacco remained green, while leaves of the WT turned yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The TG lines exhibited lower rates of leaf yellowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Fig. 5B and 5C</xref>) and higher survival rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">Fig. 6B and 6C</xref>) than WT lines under drought and salt treatments. The rate of leaf yellowing, plant height and survival rate are the typical phenotypic and physiological parameters used to evaluate resistance in crop plants. Plants that are taller, with higher survival rates and fewer yellow leaves are more tolerant to stresses. The phenotypic characterization suggested that overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> enhanced drought and salt stress tolerance.</p>

        <p>To investigate the physiological differences between control and TG plants, some important physiological indices were measured. Compared with the WT plants, the TG lines showed remarkably higher levels of RWC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6D</xref>), proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6E</xref>) and soluble sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6F</xref>), but lower levels of MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6G</xref>) under drought and salt conditions. Subsequently, the presence of ROS in WT lines and TG lines was detected with NBT staining and DAB staining. Under normal conditions, both WT and TG seedlings accumulated less superoxide. Moreover, no staining was detected in WT or TG lines in control treatment. The control treatment result suggested that the staining was caused by superoxide or hydrogen peroxide specifically. After exposure to drought or salt treatments, the ROS level of WT plants accumulated greater than TG seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Figs. 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6H</xref>). DAB staining showed that the WT line accumulated more hydrogen peroxide along the main vein under drought and salt stresses. The staining results suggesting that overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> decreased the accumulation of ROS under drought and salt treatments. In conclusion, the physiological characterization results suggested that overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> increased RWC, proline and sugar content, and decreased MDA and ROS accumulation under drought and salt conditions.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recently, more attention has been paid to WRKY transcription factors in regulating plant growth and development and biotic stress; however, their precise functions remain uncertain. Moreover, compared with the progress on biotic stresses, less progress has been made on understanding the function of WRKY proteins in the abiotic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Chen1">[25]</xref>. Wheat is the foremost staple food crop in the world which provides both calories and proteins to over 35% of the human population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Nevo1">[53]</xref>. The production of wheat is affected by multiple environmental stresses, including drought, salinity and extreme temperatures. However, only two wheat WRKYs have been characterized; <italic>TaWRKY2</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY19</italic> are involved in abiotic stresses responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Niu1">[28]</xref>. In the present study, 10 non-redundant wheat WRKYs were identified and <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> was characterized to function as a positive factor in abiotic stresses.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title><italic>TaWRKY10</italic> is a Member of the WRKY Family in Wheat</title>
        <p>The conserved primary structural features of the TaWRKYs were identified using MEME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). All 10 deduced WRKY proteins have WRKY domains and zinc finger motifs. Notably, TaWRKY4 and TaWRKY8, which carry only one WRKY domain, belong to group I WRKY proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). This might be explained by the secondary loss of an N-terminal WRKY domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Eulgem1">[13]</xref>. The result of subcellular localization of TaWRKY10-GFP indicated that the construct was located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies on WRKY transcription factors from other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Zou1">[54]</xref>. The localization data were consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis, which showed that TaWRKY10 contained a nuclear localization signal. This implies that it acts as part of a transcription-regulating complex, as predicted by Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (data not shown). Transcriptional activation analysis showed that the transcriptional activity in the presence of full-length TaWRKY10 protein and N-terminal domain. Activating regions are typically acidic and probably form part of an &#x3B1;-helix. The N-terminal region of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> is acidic (amino acid 31&#x2013;70, pI &#x200A;=&#x200A;3.62), which has transcriptional activity. These data conclude that the <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> is a member of the WRKY family in wheat and may serve as a transcription activator.</p>

        <title>TaWRKY10 Plays a Positive Role during Abiotic Stresses</title>
        <p>In our study, quantitative PCR demonstrated that <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> was induced by multiple stresses, including PEG6000, NaCl, cold (4&#xB0;C) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Responses to abiotic stimuli of WRKY transcription factors are often extremely rapid and transient. The WRKY transcription factors mediate signals transduction <italic>via</italic> activating adaptive responses and regulation of downstream genes. During responses to multiple stresses, a single WRKY gene often participates various signaling pathways, indicating its diverse regulatory mechanism. The expressions of certain stress-induced genes have been demonstrated to be associated with stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Chen1">[25]</xref>. The response of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> to a broad range of environmental stresses implied that <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> might be involved in different stress signaling pathways as a connection point.</p>
        <p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> role of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> in plant resistance was clearly demonstrated in transgenic tobacco lines transformed with an overexpression construct for <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>. Under drought and salt stress conditions, the WT plants were smaller, more withered and more yellow, while the TG tobaccos were more able to adapt to those stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6</xref>). The rate of leaf yellowing and the survival rate are typical phenotypic and physiological parameters used for evaluating plants resistance. Plants with higher survival rate and fewer yellow leave have higher tolerance and are more resistant to stresses. Our findings were consistent with previous results reporting that <italic>BcWRKY46</italic>, <italic>TaWRKY2</italic>, <italic>TaWRKY19</italic>, and <italic>HvWRKY38</italic> conferred drought and salt stresses, and enhanced stress tolerance, in transgenic plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Niu1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Wang2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Xiong2">[56]</xref>.

        <title>Overexpression of the <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> in Tobacco Increases Drought and Salt Resistance</title>
        <p>After drought or salt treatment for 3 weeks, TG lines accumulated higher levels of RWC, proline and soluble sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6</xref>). RWC is a relevant index for measuring plant water status under drought tolerance. Plants accumulate several metabolites, such as proline, and a variety of sugars and sugar alcohols to prevent these detrimental changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Vinocur1">[57]</xref>. The accumulations of free proline and soluble sugar in plants play highly protective roles under stresses conditions. Studies have shown that plants with higher proline and soluble sugar had better stress resistances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Shao1">[58]</xref>. Thus, our results indicated that the TG lines increase drought and salt resistance by osmoregulation.</p>
        <p>It has been reported that abiotic stress causes lipid peroxidation, leading to MDA accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Liu1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Kong1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Wu1">[61]</xref>. MDA content could be used as a measure of the damage caused by abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Sathiyaraj1">[62]</xref>. Our results demonstrated that TaWRKY10 might protect the plant by decreasing the accumulation of MDA. In the second experiment, <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>-overexpressing plants exhibited lower O<sub>2&#x2212;</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation than WT plants under drought and salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g005">Figs. 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g006">6H</xref>). ROS, which comprise O<sub>2&#x2212;</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radicals (HO&#xB7;), are highly reactive and toxic to cells, and finally result in oxidative damages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Mittler1">[63]</xref>. Plants have to maintain their ROS balance to minimize cellular damage caused by stress. Among the variety of ROS compounds, the present study investigated the effect of superoxide (O<sub>2&#x2212;</sub>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in abiotic stress resistant. The results showed that overexpression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> reduced cellular injuries caused by ROS in TG seedlings.

        <title>TaWRKY10 Confers Drought and Salt Stress through Stress Related Genes</title>
        <p>To gain a further insight into the function of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> in stress tolerance at the molecular level, the expressions of 8 stress related genes were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065120-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). <italic>NtERD10C</italic> belongs to LEA-like proteins, which are highly hydrophilic and glycine-rich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Xiong3">[64]</xref>.

Diverse choices for posttranslational modification of the SPSA protein allow enzyme activity adaptate to severe environment rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Baxter1">[68]</xref>. This is especially important in actively photosynthesizing leaves during adaptation to salt stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Chen5">[69]</xref>. The results in this study suggested that <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> constitutively regulated the expression of genes that involved in osmoregulation in TG seedlings. Subsequently, we examined the expression of genes response to oxidative stress. GPXs are enzymes that catalyze decreases in hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxide and lipid hydroperoxide, and protect cells against oxidative radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Eshdat1">[70]</xref>. Plant GPX proteins or transcripts increased in response to several stresses, including biotic and abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065120-Takemoto1">[71]</xref>. Our results indicated that <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> alters the expression of oxidative related genes in response to stress. Thus, it might be that abiotic stresses regulate the expression of <italic>TaWRKY10</italic>; the accumulation of the TaWRKY10 then most likely upregulates the transcription of downstream stress-inducible genes, and the obtained proteins resulted in the increased the resistance to stress conditions.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrated that TaWRKY10 is a stress-inducible wheat transcription factor, and that the <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> was up-regulated by PEG, NaCl, cold and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> could enhance drought and salt stress tolerances in transgenic tobacco plants. These functions are achieved by accumulating water, proline and soluble sugar contents, and by reducing plant ROS and MDA contents. <italic>TaWRKY10</italic> confers drought and salt stress tolerance by regulating the expression of stress related genes, thus protecting plants from damage. However, further evidences are needed to verify whether these genes are direct targets of TaWRKY10s. Thus, exploring the specific and direct genes regulated by TaWRKY10, together with its interacting partners will reveal the exact mechanisms of plant responses to abiotic stresses.</p>
