        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>A 33 amino acid fragment sequence of 136 residue Hpa1 harpin expressed in transgenic wheat induces the phloem defence that efectively represses infestations of English grain aphid on the crop.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The harpin protein Hpa1 has multiple beneficial effects in plants, promoting plant growth and development, increasing crop yield, and inducing resistance to pathogens and insect pests. For these effects, the 10&#x2013;40 residue fragment (Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>) isolated from the Hpa1 sequence is 1.3- to 7.5-fold more effective than the full-length protein. Here it is reported that the expression of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> under the direction of an insect-induced promoter induces the phloem-based defence to English grain aphid, a dominant species of wheat aphids. The expression of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> was found to compromise the colonization preference of aphids on the plant and further inhibit aphid reproduction in leaf colonies. In Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-expressing wheat lines, moreover, aphid feeding from the phloem was repressed in correlation with the phloem-based defence. This defensive mechanism was shown as enhanced expression of wheat genes encoding phloem lectin proteins (PP2-A1 and PP2-A2) and &#x3B2;-1,3-glucan synthase-like enzymes (GSL2, GSL10, and GSL12). Both PP2-A and &#x3B2;-1,3-glucan formed high molecular mass polymers to block phloem sieve plate pores and therefore impede aphid feeding from the phloem. However, the phloem-based defence was impaired by treating plants with ethylene signalling inhibitors, suggesting the requirement for the ethylene signalling pathway. In addition, if Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-expressing plants were subjected to attack by a small number of aphids, they newly acquired agriculturally beneficial characters, such as enhanced vegetative growth and increased tiller numbers and grain output values. These results suggest that the defensive and developmental roles of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> can be integrated into the germplasm of this agriculturally significant crop.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hpa1 (synonym HpaG) is a harpin protein produced by <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic>, an important bacterial pathogen of rice (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Like all harpin orthologues identified in different species of Gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Beer, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), Hpa1 induces plant growth and defence responses (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The dual effect depends on plant sensing of the N-terminal region in the Hpa1 sequence (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). From this region, the 10&#x2013;42 residue fragment (Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>) was isolated, produced by prokaryotic expression (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic>
</xref>), and analysed for its effects on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (biological model plant), tobacco (cash crop), tea (drinking crop), and rice (food crop). In these plants, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> is 1.3- to 7.5-fold more effective than the full-length Hpa1 in inducing resistance to pathogens and enhancing plant growth or increasing crop products (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). In tea plants, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> is 1.3-fold more active than Hpa1 in elevating the yield of the top three leaves used as drinking material (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In rice, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> is 2.7 and 7.5 times stronger than Hpa1 in eliciting resistance to blast (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>b</italic>
</xref>) and bacterial blight (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). The growth enhancement is 1.5-fold higher (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>
</xref>) and the grain yield increase is 2.0-fold more (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>b</italic>
</xref>) in rice plants treated with Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> compared with Hpa1. In tobacco, however, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> is nearly 30-fold less active than Hpa1 in eliciting hypersensitive cell death (HCD) (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). HCD is a defence response and also a developmental cost associated with defence responses (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Dangl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Indeed, resistance is activated in an HCD-independent manner in Hpa1-expressing transgenic tobacco (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Therefore, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> is a desired agricultural agent that induces plant growth enhancement and defence responses with little cost to plant development (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">One of the multiple effects of harpins in plants is to induce resistance to insects, especially aphids (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Aphids represent a typical group of phloem-feeding insects that are highly specialized in their mode of feeding (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Tjallingii, 1988</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Tjallingii and Esch, 1993</xref>) and produce a unique stress on plant fitness (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Will and van Bel, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">De Vos and Jander, 2009</xref>). The stress is often devastating to the production of agriculturally significant crops, such as wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.). Wheat aphids mainly belong to <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic> Rondani, <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> Linnaeus, and <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> Fabricius (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Basky and F&#xF3;nagy, 2003</xref>). These species are indigenous, and <italic>S. avenae</italic> (commonly called English grain aphid) is dominant in China (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Hong and Ding, 2007</xref>). Aphids attack every aerial part of wheat during the plant&#x2019;s development from Feekes stage 1 (one-shoot stage) through to Feekes stage 11 (grain-ripening stage) (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). Aphid attacks cause chlorosis and necrosis with repression of photosynthesis in aerial organs of wheat, or cause direct damage to wheat grains, resulting in a severe decrease in the grain yield (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Hong and Ding, 2007</xref>). Aphids have strong capabilities for multiplication and constantly attack plants with huge populations, which pose challenges for insect management. If a harpin induces growth and defence in wheat as in other plants, the dual effect may compensate for aphid-induced damage and contribute to effective control of the insect.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The multiple effects of harpins are attributable to cross-talk of distinct hormone signalling pathways that regulate development and defence in plants (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). Harpin-induced plant growth and resistance to a phloem-feeding generalist, the green peach aphid (<italic>Myzus persicae</italic> Sulzer), is coordinated by the ethylene signalling pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In response to a harpin protein, the ethylene signalling regulators EIN5 and EIN2 act to confer growth and resistance phenotypes, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Also, in response to harpin, the ethylene signalling pathway recruits the transcription factor MYB44 to co-regulate the phloem-based defence, which specifically resists attacks by phloem-feeding insects (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Expression of the <italic>MYB44</italic> gene is induced by aphid infestations or by ethylene, either applied to plants or produced in harpin-treated plants (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The 3&#x2032;-terminal 2000 nucleotide fragment (<italic>44P</italic>
<sub><italic>2000</italic></sub>) isolated from the predicted 3500 nucleotide sequence of the <italic>MYB44</italic> gene promoter is sufficient to direct <italic>MYB44</italic> transcription in response to ethylene or a harpin protein (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The <italic>44P</italic>
<sub><italic>2000</italic></sub>-controlled expression of <italic>MYB44</italic> leads to the production of the MYB44 protein and its localization to the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, MYB44 binds to the promoter of <italic>EIN2</italic> and activates its transcription. In the presence of ethylene, moreover, the EIN2 protein exists stably in the cytosol to perform multiple roles in plant development and defence (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alonso <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Qiao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">One of the roles that EIN2 plays is to cooperate with MYB44 in regulating the phloem-based defence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The defence essentially involves synchronized expression of the <italic>PP2-A</italic> gene, which encodes the phloem lectin protein PP2-A (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), and the <italic>GSL5</italic> gene, which encodes the &#x3B2;-1,3-glucan synthase GSL5 (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Subsequently, the PP2-A protein dimerizes and the dimer is further linked with phloem protein PP1 to form a high molecular weight polymer that accumulates to block phloem sieve plate pores (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Read <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Dinant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kehr, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Will <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Beneteau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This process accompanies the biosynthesis of &#x3B2;-1,3-glucan callose via catalysis by the synthase and subsequent coagulation on sieve plates and closure of sieve plate pores (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Stone and Clarke, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In harpin-treated plants, the GLS5-mediated callose coagulation on sieve plates and the closure of sieve plate pores by callose and AtPP2&#x2013;PP1 complexes impede the phloem-feeding activity of the green peach aphid (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, PP2-A and GSL5 are indispensable components of the phloem-based defence that is inducible by harpin and regulated by EIN2 and MYB44. In addition, MYB44 is implicated in salicylic acid signalling for resistance to pathogens (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Zou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and abscisic acid signalling for drought tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), while the induction of both signalling pathways is a conserved function of harpin (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that MYB44 is an integrator of harpin-activated development and defence pathways.</p>

A total of 600 aphids were monitored in three repetitions of the experiments for each genotype of plant. In each experimental repetition, 200 aphids were placed on 20 leaves of 10 plants. In the subsequent 5 d, aphid movement was monitored every 2h, and the number of aphids in each leaf colony was scored.

Relocalized aphids were removed immediately to avoid interfering with reproduction surveys. For reproduction, newborn nymphs were counted and then removed twice a day. The reproduction rate was quantified as the ratio between the total numbers of nymphs produced in 5 d and the total numbers of aphid adults that stayed in their original leaf colonies during the same period.</p>

        <p>To correlate the repression of aphid feeding from the phloem with the phloem-based defence, callose deposition and the expression of <italic>PP2A</italic> and <italic>GSL</italic> genes in leaves were analysed to reveal if the defence might differ in Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> lines from that in the Y16 plant under attack by English grain aphid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, callose deposition was detected predominantly in vascular bundles located in the middle veins of leaves and the amounts deposited are more substantial in leaves of Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> than in those of the parent plant. Callose was found to be predominantly deposited on sieve plates to close sieve plate pores. The proportions of closed sieve plate pores were significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 by ANOVA and LSD) greater in Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> lines than in the Y16 plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

In Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> plants, moreover, significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 by ANOVA and LSD) enhancements were also found in the expression of three of nine <italic>GSL</italic> genes identified in the wheat genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert488/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert488/-/DC1">S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

As Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression needs induction, plants were colonized with a small amount of English grain aphid nymphs.

        <p>Morphological characters of grains were analysed in detail. Morphological characters of grains are often used to assess grain quality, and, if grains of two wheat cultivars are analysed, high quality is indicated by greater values of grain roundness and equivalent circle diameter but a smaller value of the long to short axis ratio (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shouche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Based on this evaluation criterion, grains of Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> lines do not conform to all parameters of high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">F</xref>). However, both the grain size and single grain weight of Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> lines are greater than those of the parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9G</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">J</xref>). Therefore, the beneficial effects of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression on agronomic characters of wheat are to enhance the vegetative growth and increase grain yield even if the Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> grains do not show high quality in all the morphological parameters. Of the six transgenic lines, moreover, Y16:Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>#6 acquires the greatest growth enhancement and grain yield increase (ANOVA and LSD, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01).

      <p content-type="indent">First, the aphid infestation induces substantial expression of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> under the direction of the <italic>44P</italic>
<sub><italic>2000</italic></sub> promoter in transgenic wheat lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), confirming that <italic>44P</italic>
<sub><italic>2000</italic></sub> is responsive to insect attacks in addition to harpin or ethylene (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). So far, three species of insects, the green peach aphid (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), the English grain aphid (this study), and the diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> L.) (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), have been shown to induce <italic>44P</italic>
<sub><italic>2000</italic></sub>-directed Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression. Due to the induced activity of <italic>44P</italic>
<sub><italic>2000</italic></sub>, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression in transgenic wheat lines is an induced but not a constitutive trait and is not likely to cause subsequent effects on the phloem-based defence in the plant without induction by aphid infestation, for instance. This provides a basis for the genetic engineering design for &#x2018;insect-induced resistance to insects&#x2019; (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Secondly, the Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression causes a repression in the performance of English grain aphid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) in correlation with a repression of phloem-feeding activities of the insect on wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In a previous study, the design for &#x2018;insect-induced resistance to insects&#x2019; was tested by observing the inhibitory effect of a primary infestation on a secondary infestation of insects on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In this case, primary infestation of the green peach aphid nymphs or diamondback month caterpillars induces resistance to secondary infestations of both insects. The present study shows that Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-induced resistance is effective in repressing the performance and behaviour of English grain aphid in the concurrent infestation.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Thirdly, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-induced phloem-based defence observed in transgenic wheat lines that were colonized with English grain aphid involves enhanced expression of defence-associated genes (<italic>PP2-A</italic>, <italic>GSL2</italic>, <italic>GSL10</italic>, and <italic>GSL12</italic>) and the closure of sieve plate pores by callose deposition under regulation by ethylene signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert488/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs S1&#x2013;S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). At present, however, it is not known whether <italic>PP2-A1</italic> and <italic>PP2-A2</italic> or the three <italic>GSL</italic> genes have functional redundancy. It is also not known whether <italic>GSL5</italic> affects the phloem-based defence in wheat as in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) since the <italic>GSL5</italic> orthologue has not been identified in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Voigt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Burton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Taketa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The role of ethylene signalling in Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-induced phloem-based defence offers additional evidence to previous demonstrations that the induction of plant defence responses through activating phytohormone signalling pathways is a conserved function of harpin proteins in a variety of plant species (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Beer, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>

In this regard, one important facet of this study is to extend the defensive scope of plant engineering with a harpin protein, from disease resistance (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>) and drought tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) to resistance against insect pests, and to extend the defensive roles from biological model plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) to agriculturally significant crops such as wheat. In particular, coincident roles of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> in inducing the phloem-based defence and altering agronomic traits, especially enhancing vegetative growth and increasing grain output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>), suggest that the defensive and developmental roles of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> can be integrated into breeding germplasm of the agriculturally significant crop.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">However, Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> may cause fitness consequences in transgenic wheat lines, such as repression of root branching and growth observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 10</xref>). The repressive effect may be attributed to an elevated level of ethylene based on previous demonstrations that the external application of a harpin protein induces the production of ethylene in aerial parts (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and roots (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and that the application of ethylene to wheat inhibits plant root elongation (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The repressive effect of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> on root development is likely to impair the agricultural value of transgenic wheat lines in planting areas where drought is a constant challenge.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">This notion is of practical significance in regard to the simultaneous improvement of developmental and defensive traits by integrating the development&#x2013;defence cross-talk mechanism into breeding germplasm of crops. Plants utilize sophisticated strategies to regulate the cross-talk and thereby minimize developmental cost and fitness consequences of defence responses to attacks by pathogens or insect pests (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Dangl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mukhtar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Spoel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). One of the strategies is to inactivate defence signal transduction to reduce the fitness consequences that are associated with a constitutive defence response in the absence of a pathogen or insect attack (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mukhtar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Spoel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Alternatives could be provided by the functional mode of harpin proteins as they induce development and defence cross-talk in different plant species (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>
</xref>). In this regard, the demonstration of defensive and developmental roles of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression in wheat represents a substantial step toward simultaneous improvements of defensive and agronomic traits by the genetic engineering technique. It is quite fascinating that a small amount of aphid infestation induces the developmental function of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> in addition to its defensive role due to the use of the multifunctional promoter (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Owing to the presence of such a promoter, the &#x2018;insect-induced resistance to insects&#x2019; strategy has dual consequences, increasing the agronomic value of grain and enhancing the phloem-based defence against English grain aphid.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The phloem-based defence is a common defensive mechanism that all plants utilize to resist attacks by phloem-feeding herbivores (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kehr, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Tjallingii, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This mechanism has been shown to impede aphid infestations effectively in different plant species including wheat and other crops (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kehr, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Tjallingii, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Will and van Bel, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The broad significance and universal value of the defensive mechanism can also be found in phloem puncturing as a highly specialized and commonly utilized mode of feeding irrespective of the aphid species and the plants they attack (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Tjallingii and Esch, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kehr, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Tjallingii, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Will and van Bel, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">L&#xFC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">C. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-induced phloem-based defence can be effective to resist other species of wheat aphids, such as <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic> Rondani and <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> Linnaeus, in addition to <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> Fabricius (English grain aphid). However, at least two additional conditions should be considered in regard to the potential of agricultural use of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-expressing plants. First, it is necessary to study in the future whether the Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub> expression is effective to resist simultaneous infestations of different species of wheat aphids. Secondly, many experiments are required to evaluate the environmental fitness of Hpa1<sub>10&#x2013;42</sub>-expressing plants under natural field conditions.</p>
