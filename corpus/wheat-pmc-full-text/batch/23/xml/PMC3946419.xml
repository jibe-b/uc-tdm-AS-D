      <abstract>
        <p>Cyclic 3&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a nucleotide derived from adenosine triphosphate that acts as a second messenger throughout all kingdoms. Intracellular cAMP levels are synthesized by a membrane-bound protein, the adenylyl cyclase. In order to analyze the function of this gene and the importance of cAMP in the life cycle of the cereal pathogen <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, the adenylyl cyclase gene (FGSG_01234) was deleted by gene replacement (&#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic>). The &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant displayed a drastically reduced growth on agar medium which could be rescued by a cAMP analogon. Furthermore, the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant was unable to produce perithecia on detached wheat nodes. However, artificial conditions like carrot agar allowed perithecia development. Pathogenicity towards wheat was drastically reduced in &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> compared to the wild type. Point-inoculated spikelets showed only small lesions but no typical head blight disease symptoms. Fluorescence microscopy using dsRed-expressing strains revealed that the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> strain was unable to develop any complex infection structures like lobate appressoria and infection cushions. Instead, hyphal anastomosis occurs frequently. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the lack of fungal penetration. Hence, the formation of compound appressoria seems to be essential for infection of wheat. Hyphae on flower leaves produced huge amounts of new conidia, thereby circumventing the infection cycle. This abundant sporulation on wheat epidermis was not observed in wild type. Intriguingly, the <italic>Fgac1</italic> deletion mutant was able to infect maize cobs as wild type, indicating that cAMP signaling is not important for maize infection. The &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant was unable to produce the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol both <italic>in vitro</italic> and during wheat infection. In this study, we show that cAMP signaling controls important cellular processes such as development of infection structures, pathogenicity, secondary metabolite production and sexual reproduction. For the first time, we show that cAMP regulates the switch from vegetative to pathogenic lifestyle of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> on wheat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of small grain cereals like wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) and of ear rot of maize. Full virulence on wheat relies on the production of the highly toxic trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON). It is synthesized by the fungus in high amounts during infection but also post harvest. Its production is prerequisite for the colonization of the rachis that connects the florets within a wheat spike. However, for the initial penetration, DON biosynthesis is dispensable, although its biosynthesis is enhanced during formation of compound appressoria on the surface of wheat floral organs <xref rid="pone.0091135-Boenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This raises the question which signals trigger the mycotoxin biosynthesis and the development of infection structures and how these signals are perceived.</p>
      <p>In general, sensing of environmental cues, the transduction of signals and an appropriate intracellular response are essential for the evolutionary success of all organisms. A key role in signal transduction cascades falls to second messengers which are small molecules like cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) or ions like calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Second messengers act as transducers for information from multiple upstream signals and may activate multiple downstream targets (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Holland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Among these targets we find protein kinase cascades and transcriptional regulators. Together, the signal transduction cascade reaches from the signal perception by transmembrane receptors to a modulation in gene transcription.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we highlight the importance of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling cascade for the development and differentiation of the cereal pathogen <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The cAMP signaling network is presumably best characterized in mammals (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Hanoune1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>) and yeasts, i.e. <italic>Schizzosaccharomyces pombe</italic><xref rid="pone.0091135-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Kronstad1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Tamaki1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Palecek1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Briefly, an extracellular signal is perceived and transmitted to the intracellular space by membrane associated receptors. Attached to these receptors are heterotrimeric G-proteins consisting of three subunits named &#x3B1;, &#x3B2;, and &#x3B3;. Upon activation, this complex dissociates into the &#x3B1;-monomer and a &#x3B2;-&#x3B3;-dimer. The &#x3B1;-subunit is supposed to activate a membrane bound enzyme, the adenylyl cyclase, leading to the conversion of ATP to cAMP and pyrophosphate. Cyclic AMP acts on the regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Upon binding of cAMP, these subunits dissociate and give rise to active catalytic PKA-subunits. In this state, the PKA is able to activate a plethora of downstream effectors (summarized e.g. in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). In phytopathogenic fungi like <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> and <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, cAMP signaling is an important trigger for pathogenesis (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). Phytopathogenic fungi evolved distinct strategies for host penetration. Hyphae of the hemi-biotrophic grass pathogen <italic>Claviceps purpurea</italic> for example undergo no obvious morphological change prior invasion <xref rid="pone.0091135-Tudzynksi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Penetration of the plant surface is enzyme dependent, since the deletion of two endopolygalacturonase genes leads to almost apathogenicity <xref rid="pone.0091135-Oeser1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Other phytopathogenic fungi form infection structures that are, in general, regarded as modified hyphae specialized on the invasion of plant tissues. Best described are the classical appressoria of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. A classical appressorium is known as a dome-shaped swollen cell at the tip of the conidial germ tube. A mature classical appressorium is separated from the germ tube by a septum and darkly pigmented by melanized cell walls. Melanized cell walls can stand a high turgor pressure, which is built up to perforate the host cell wall by a so-called penetration peg or hyphae <xref rid="pone.0091135-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Another type of appressoria are the so-called compound appressoria. Compound appressoria include multicellular lobate appressoria and infection cushions. Both types are formed by epiphytic mycelium and, usually, not by germ tubes (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Emmett1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Mendgen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, disruption of the cAMP-signaling cascade, namely the adenylyl cyclase <xref rid="pone.0091135-Klimpel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, one catalytic subunit, and the regulatory subunit of the PKA, evoked a drastic reduction in vegetative and pathogenic development. Interestingly, however, pseudoappressoria were still formed and, thus, the initial penetration of the plant surface was only slightly delayed <xref rid="pone.0091135-Schumacher1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Adenylyl cyclase deficient mutants of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> fail to penetrate the plant. Their ability to form appressoria is abolished <xref rid="pone.0091135-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, intracellular cAMP levels contribute to pathogenic development, although adenylyl cyclase activity seems not to be equally crucial for infection structure development in all necrotrophs. <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is regarded as a hemibiotrophic pathogen at least in early stages of infection, i.e. during plant surface penetration and initial intercellular growth. In later stages, however, a switch in the lifestyle towards necrotrophy can be observed (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Kazan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>). Microscopic analysis using dissected wheat floret organs revealed that <italic>F. graminearum</italic> holds a large arsenal of infection structures of increasing complexity <xref rid="pone.0091135-Boenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Initially, the plant cuticle is penetrated by simple infection hyphae emerging as side-branches from long, mostly unbranched runner hyphae. After colonization of the surface, hyphal branching becomes more frequent and infection structures of higher complexity appear: lobate appressoria and infection cushions. Underneath these complex structures, numerous penetration pores are detectable <xref rid="pone.0091135-Boenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we provide evidence for a critical role of cAMP-related signaling in the initiation of a pathogenic interaction of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> with wheat. Disruption of cAMP signaling by deletion of the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> adenylyl cyclase gene blocks infection structure development and completely impedes penetration of wheat epidermal cells, instead vegetative reproduction is induced. Furthermore, we provide data on the impact of cAMP-signaling on sexual reproduction and DON biosynthesis.</p>

        <p>All mutants described in this study derived from the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> wild-type strain PH1. For vector cloning, the uracil-auxotrophic <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain FGSC 9721 (FY 834) was used. Plasmids were amplified using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH5&#x3B1;. Bacteria were cultivated in sterile lysogeny broth (LB) medium <xref rid="pone.0091135-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> either as a liquid culture or on agar plates. Yeast cells were cultured in YPG and in SD medium lacking uracil.</p>
        <p>Conidiation of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was induced in liquid wheat medium (15 g wheat leafs, shredded and autoclaved in 1 l H<sub>2</sub>O) incubated for seven days at 28&#xB0;C. Sexual reproduction was monitored on carrot agar plates and detached wheat nodes placed on water agar plates (double autoclaved wheat parts with a nodium in the middle). Conidia of the wild type (WT:PH1), the <italic>Fgac1</italic> deletion strain (&#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic>), the ectopic (ECT), and the complemented strain (c<italic>Fgac1</italic>) were inoculated on carrot agar plates and incubated at 28&#xB0;C in the dark. After 3 days postinoculation (dpi), the aerial mycelia were knocked down with 1 ml of sterile 2.5% Tween 60 solution, using a sterile glass rod. The carrot agar plates and wheat nodes on water agar plates were further incubated at 18&#xB0;C under near-UV light and white light with a 12-h photoperiod for up to 8 weeks. To assay ascospore viability, the lids of petri dishes containing mature perithecia were covered with thin layer of CM. Forcibly discharged ascospores that landed on the CM gave rise to new colonies which were then documented. For growth assays, mycelial plugs of the wild type and all mutant strains were taken from the edge of a 3-day-old colony on complete medium (CM; <xref rid="pone.0091135-Leach1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) and placed in the middle of the assay plates. Supplements for the growth assays are indicated in the figure legends. All plates were incubated at 28&#xB0;C for at least 3 days in the dark. The diameter of the colonies was measured using a technical ruler. The analyses were performed with at least 5 replicates.</p>

        <title>Vector Construction for Deletion and Complementation of <italic>Fgac1</italic></title>
        <p>Standard recombinant DNA methods were performed according to Ausubel <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Ausubel1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Sambrook <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The open reading frame of <italic>Fgac1</italic> was disrupted using a double homologous recombination approach. For vector construction, flanking regions (720 kb upstream and 504 kb downstream of <italic>Fgac1</italic>) were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA (gDNA) using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s007">table S1</xref>. The PCR was initiated by denaturation at 94&#xB0;C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94&#xB0;C for 45 s, 55&#xB0;C for 45 s and 72&#xB0;C for 60 s. The PCR included a final extension step at 72&#xB0;C for 10 min and a cooling step at 4&#xB0;C. The replacement vector was constructed using yeast recombinational cloning method (YRC; <xref rid="pone.0091135-Colot1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). For the replacement construct, the gene flanks and a cassette comprising the gene encoding a hygromycin phosphotransferase driven by the glycerinaldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (P<italic>gpd</italic>) from <italic>A. nidulans</italic> together with the linearized pRS426 plasmid comprising a ampicillin resistance cassette and a gene facilitating uracil biosynthesis were co-transformed into yeast strain FGSC 9721 (FY 834). Homologues overhangs to adjacent fragments facilitate recombination and fusion of all fragments to give rise to a circular plasmid that confers uracil prototrophy. Prototrophic clones were selected and checked by PCR (data not shown). Plasmids were isolated from PCR-positive clones and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>. The replacement fragment was released from the plasmid (named pRS426:delta<italic>Fgac1</italic>) by restriction with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Kpn</italic>I and used for fungal transformation. The complementation construct (pRS426:c<italic>Fgac1</italic>) was also generated by use of the YRC technique. Using a proof-reading polymerase, the entire ORF (7245 bp) and 1672 bp of upstream sequence were amplified in five parts (primers 9&#x2013;18; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s007">table S1</xref>) with overlapping sequence to the adjacent fragments.

Inclined reflected light of an external halogen lamp KL 1500 Electronic (Schott, Mainz, Germany) was used to visualize plant necroses as well as the mycelium under normal light conditions. Infection structures of the reporter strains were investigated by fluorescence microscopy using Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 microscope equipped with a Zeiss Apotome (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A UV (ultra violet) lamp HAL 100 served as UV light source. DsRed was excited in the range of 538 to 562 nm and detected in the 570 to 640 nm range.

        <title>Generation of Mutants</title>
        <p>A comparative database survey using known orthologues of adenylyl cyclases led to the identification of the putative <italic>F. graminearum</italic> orthologue, FGSG_01234. Functional domain analysis using the Conserved Domain Database on NCBI <xref rid="pone.0091135-MarchlerBauer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> revealed the presence of a G-alpha binding domain, a mononucleotidyl cyclases domain, and two regions containing leucine-rich repeats for protein-protein interactions. In order to functionally characterize this protein, we deleted most of the ORF by targeted gene replacement. For this purpose, flanks comprising sequence of the 5-prime UTR and the 3-prime end of the gene were fused to a hygromycin resistance cassette and transformed into the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> wild type isolate PH1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s001">fig.

However, repetitive single-spore isolations were necessary to obtain a homokaryotic deletion strain. This mutant (&#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic>) was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s001">fig.

An analogous wild-type mutant was also generated. In order to univocally prove that the observed phenotypes are due to the deletion of the adenylyl cyclase gene, we reintroduced the gene and approximately 1000 kb upstream sequence to complement the mutant.</p>

When inoculated on autoclaved wheat straw, the wild type usually forms clusters of perithecia within four weeks. On carrot agar plates it takes approximately three weeks.

        <p>SEM and LSM analysis confirmed that type-I infection structures, such as infection hyphae, were absent in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g004">fig. 4B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">fig. 5G</xref>). Using SEM, a mucilage-like substance is visible between wild-type hyphae and the plant surface, especially in immediate vicinity of infection structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">fig. 5B and C</xref>). It is noteworthy that mucilage was never observed on samples inoculated with the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">fig. 5H and I</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to check for penetration events, mycelia of the wild type and the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant were removed from glumes after 8 dpi. Underneath the mycelium of the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant, we never detected penetration pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">Fig. 5J and K</xref>). The plant cuticle remained intact. Thus, the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant&#x2019;s hyphae do not facilitate successful colonization of the host plant. Underneath wild type infection structures, in contrast, we observed numerous penetration pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">fig. 5E and F</xref>). Further proof of the lack of penetration in the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant is provided by data obtained from cross sections of paleas inoculated with the dsRed-expressing strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g004">fig. 4</xref>). Hyphae of WT-dsRed were visible inside epidermal cells, subepidermal parenchymya cells, and vascular cells at 8 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g004">fig. 4A and C</xref>). &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic>-dsRed never grew inside or beneath the epidermal cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g004">fig. 4B and D</xref>). Instead, we observed a diffuse plant-derived autofluorescence in parenchyma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g004">fig. 4D</xref>). Since there is no hyphal growth detectable, a plant defense reaction is assumed. However, the nature of this reaction remains elusive. Addition of 8-CPT to the inoculum and 6 dpi facilitated plant penetration by the deletion mutant and, at least partially, restored the ability to form infection structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s006">fig.

        <p>Taken together, these results point out that functional cAMP signaling is of vital importance for the pathogenic development of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The morphogenetic switch to conidia production at early stages of epiphytic growth reflects a tremendous disruption of the usual pathogenic circle in which conidia are produced only after a nearly complete decomposition of the host tissue.</p>

        <p>Unexpectedly, the mutant was fully virulent on maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g007">fig. 7</xref>). The maize inbred line A188 was inoculated with conidia of the wild type and the disrupted strain through the silk channel. After 35 dpi, the disease symptoms were evaluated. All maize cobs were colonized and the kernels were rotten and covered with reddish mycelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g007">fig. 7</xref>). There was no difference in symptom severity detectable between the mutant and the wild type. We tested whether or not corn had a high cAMP level that could rescue the defect of delta-Fgac1 mutant. Measurement of intracellular cAMP levels using ELISA did not reveal an accumulation of cAMP in uninfected and &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic>-mutant infected maize kernels. Only in wild-type infected maize kernels, cAMP levels increased significantly. Hence, cAMP signaling seems not to be necessary for maize infection. Since cAMP level do not increase in &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> infected maize cobs we can deduce that nearly the entire cAMP derives from the fungus. The same pattern was observed in the wheat samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g008">fig. 8</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The entire life cycle of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in nature relies on the successful colonization of a susceptible host plant by its infecting agents, i.e. macroconidia and ascospores. Each step in the life cycle is triggered by environmental cues like temperature, light and humidity (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Kazan2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Trail1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>). Perception and subsequent processing of signals from a variable environment is based on a cascade comprising of receptors and intracellular modules that are able to transmit and amplify a signal to downstream effectors. Second messengers play a decisive role in these cascades. Here, we analyzed the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP for its function in virulence, vegetative growth, secondary metabolism, and sexual reproduction.</p>

        <title>Deoxynivalenol Biosynthesis is Controlled by cAMP</title>
        <p>A prevalent secondary metabolite of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is DON. It is harmful to humans and animals and is, in contrast to ZEA, a virulence factor for the infection of wheat. DON biosynthesis can be induced <italic>in vitro</italic> by several additives to media such as polyamines <xref rid="pone.0091135-Gardiner1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Gardiner2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Ponts1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and cobalt chloride <xref rid="pone.0091135-Tsuyuki1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, its biosynthesis is influenced by ambient conditions like temperature <xref rid="pone.0091135-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and pH <xref rid="pone.0091135-Gardiner3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The underlying regulation processes and signaling cascades are complex and not fully revealed. Our results indicate that cAMP signaling cascade represent a superior regulatory framework for DON biosynthesis, since the <italic>Fgac1</italic> deletion mutants were deficient in DON biosynthesis both <italic>in planta</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>in-planta</italic> results are of limited impact, as the mutant was not able to penetrate and colonize the plant. Due to this lack of invasive growth, the areas of high DON induction within the wheat floret, i.e. the caryopsis and the rachis node <xref rid="pone.0091135-Ilgen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, were never reached by the mutant. Recent studies <italic>in F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> demonstrate a complicated interplay between the different enzymes within the cAMP signaling cascade. Deletion of one (but not the two other) G alpha (named GzGPA1) and of the unique G beta subunit in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> resulted in an increased DON and ZEA biosynthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. None of the mutants however, was decreased in DON as was the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant in our study. This suggests that, under DON inducing conditions, none of the G-protein subunits activate the adenylyl cyclase. It cannot be ruled out that functional redundancy in the G alpha subunits contribute to the minor phenotypes observed for single deletion mutants in the subunits compared to the deletion of the unique adenylyl cyclase. Deletion of the <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> adenylyl cyclase, but not of the G alpha subunits, led to a down-regulation of gibberellic acid biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0091135-Studt1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. These results draw a picture of a complicated crosstalk between different regulators that act specifically in response to certain environmental cues (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s008">table S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Disruption of Cyclic AMP Signaling Prevents Hyphal Differentiation Leading to the Formation of Infection Structures</title>
        <p>Deletion of the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> adenylyl cyclase abolished the ability to develop compound appressoria. Intruigingly, the mutants were also unable to penetrate wheat epidermal cells. This correlation strongly suggests that the formation of complex infection structures is prerequisite for successful colonization of wheat tissue. On wheat floral organs, the mutant was hypersporulating which represents a dramatic morphogenetic switch in the lifestyle from pathogenic to vegetative growth. It seems plausible that the transition from runner hyphae to complex infection structures on wheat floral leaves is triggered by cAMP levels. Elevated cAMP levels in wild-type infected wheat samples, as proven by the ELISA analysis, may influence the formation of compound appressoria, while depletion of intracellular cAMP favors sporulation during wheat infection. Considering the wild-type like pathogencity of the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant to maize, we have to assume that infection structures are less important for penetration of maize. Therefore, the pathogenic lifestyle occurs and early sporulation is suppressed. However, comprehensive histology of the infection process of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> on maize is still missing. Deletion of <italic>tri5</italic>, encoding a trichodien synthase in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, drastically reduces virulence on wheat but has no influence on disease development on maize <xref rid="pone.0091135-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, histological analysis of primary infection stages revealed that &#x394;<italic>tri5</italic> mutants are able to penetrate the host tissue in a wild-type like manner <xref rid="pone.0091135-Boenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Hence, the pathogenicity phenotype in the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant is most likely not correlated to the abolished DON biosynthesis.</p>
        <p>It is proposed that both chemical and physical stimuli are involved in the induction of appressorium formation in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and that cAMP signaling is involved. Adenylyl cyclase deletion mutants of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> were unable to form appressoria on a hydrophobic surface and were non-pathogenic on rice leafs <xref rid="pone.0091135-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Instead, the mutants continue to grow as hyphae on the surface of inoculated onion epidermal tissue, a phenotype that we also observed in the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant on glumes.</p>
        <p>We, so far, did not identify conditions to induce compound appressoria formation <italic>in vitro</italic> on agar plates or artificial surfaces (M. J. Boenisch, unpublished results). Hence, specific and as-yet unknown compounds present on natural surfaces seem to be necessary for compound appressoria formation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Exogenous nutrient sources such as plant exudates or sucrose generally promote an increase in branching frequency during infection cushion development of <italic>R. solani</italic> on artificial surfaces <xref rid="pone.0091135-Armentrout1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091135-Stockwell1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, the availability of nutrients is discussed to be necessary for the production of mucilage in <italic>R. solani</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091135-Armentrout1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> which might be necessary for adhesion of runner hyphae to surfaces <xref rid="pone.0091135-Armentrout1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0091135-Matsuura1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and thigmotropic growth which finally results in the formation of infection cushions. We also observed the formation of mucilage surrounding the wild-type, but not the mutant hyphae that colonize the host surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">fig.5</xref>, C, H and I). Hence, it is feasible that a defective sensing of a certain nutritional environment together with the absence of mucilage in the mutant strain contributes to the lack of infection structures.</p>

        <title>Disruption of cAMP Signaling Interferes with Sexual Reproduction, Conidiation and Hyphal Fusion</title>
        <p>The lack of mature perithecia on wheat straw might be due to a dysfunctional sensing of the environment by the deletion mutant. Results from Kr&#xFC;ger and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0091135-Krger1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> connect the cAMP signaling pathway with the regulation of pheromone responsive genes. Deletion of a G alpha subunit in <italic>U. maydis</italic> led to sterile mutants <xref rid="pone.0091135-Krger1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Deletion of one of three G alpha subunits (GzGPA1) in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> caused sterility on carrot agar plates <xref rid="pone.0091135-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Since the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant was able to produce perithecia on carrot agar but not on wheat, it seems likely that different G alpha subunits contribute to the activation of the adenylyl cyclase, depending on the environmental conditions. It is tempting to speculate that a dysfunctional sensing of plant-derived nutrients or certain patterns on the plant surface lead to the sterility phenotype on wheat nodes. Carrot agar, in this regard, might contain substances that bypass the adenylyl cyclase pathway and, thereby, facilitate perithecia formation.</p>
        <p>The observation that the mutant produces conidia during epiphytic growth on detached wheat floral leaves and on solid substrates like CM, but not in submersed culture, substantiates the hypothesis of an influence of nutrient sensing, since also conidia production is nutrient-dependent <xref rid="pone.0091135-Dahlberg1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Interestingly, adenylyl cyclase knock-out mutants of <italic>N. crassa</italic> also sporulated under inappropriate conditions <xref rid="pone.0091135-Kays1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Also, a high abundance of hyphal fusion events (anastomoses) is regarded as an indicator for nutrient starvation conditions (see <xref rid="pone.0091135-Roca1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and references therein). Accordingly, numerous anastomoses occur between runner hyphae of the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant but not the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091135-g005">fig. 5I</xref>). Hyphal fusions are believed to facilitate genetic exchange in a parasexual cycle, but can also be used to build up a hyphal network in order to acquire resources (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091135-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>). All these findings suggest that the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic> mutant is not able to acquire nutrition on intact natural substrates.</p>
        <p>In the present study, we were able to shade some light on the complex regulation pattern that involves hyphal differentiation, DON production and virulence. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091135.s008">Table S2</xref> provides an overview on phenotypes observed after deletion of adenylyl cyclases in other phytopathogenic fungi.

DNA of the mutant and wild type strain was digested using <italic>Hin</italic>dIII (for probe 1) and <italic>Dra</italic>I (for probe 2), separated on agarose gels, blotted on membranes and probed with a DIG-labelled probe for a fragment of the flanking region of <italic>Fgac1</italic> (probe 1) and for a gene-internal fragment of <italic>Fgac1</italic> (probe 2). Probe 1 hybridized with the DNA of the disruption mutant (6717 bps) and the wild type (2827 bps). Probe 2 only gave a signal in the wild type. <bold>C.</bold> PCR analysis of the &#x394;<italic>Fgac1</italic>, one ectopic, and three complemented mutants, and the wild type. Deletion of <italic>Fgac1</italic> was verified in one mutant (analyzed after single spore purification) using primers 5 and 6. The wild type, the ectopic strain (ECT) and the complemented mutants (c<italic>Fgac1</italic>) were PCR-positive for the gene internal fragment (915 bps).</p>
