          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The caleosin genes encode proteins with a single conserved EF hand calcium-binding domain and comprise small gene families found in a wide range of plant species. Some members of the gene family have been shown to be upregulated by environmental stresses including low water availability and high salinity. Caleosin 3 from wheat has been shown to interact with the &#x3B1;-subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins, and to act as a GTPase activating protein (GAP). This study characterizes the size and diversity of the gene family in wheat and related species and characterizes the differential tissue-specific expression of members of the gene family.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>A total of 34 gene family members that belong to eleven paralogous groups of caleosins were identified in the hexaploid bread wheat, <italic>T. aestivum.</italic> Each group was represented by three homeologous copies of the gene located on corresponding homeologous chromosomes, except the caleosin 10, which has four gene copies. Ten gene family members were identified in diploid barley, <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>, and in rye, <italic>Secale cereale,</italic> seven in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, and six in rice, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>. The analysis of gene expression was assayed in triticale and rye by RNA-Seq analysis of 454 sequence sets and members of the gene family were found to have diverse patterns of gene expression in the different tissues that were sampled in rye and in triticale, the hybrid hexaploid species derived from wheat and rye. Expression of the gene family in wheat and barley was also previously determined by microarray analysis, and changes in expression during development and in response to environmental stresses are presented.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The caleosin gene family had a greater degree of expansion in the Triticeae than in the other monocot species, <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and rice. The prior implication of one member of the gene family in the stress response and heterotrimeric G protein signaling, points to the potential importance of the caleosin gene family. The complexity of the family and differential expression in various tissues and under conditions of abiotic stress suggests the possibility that caleosin family members may play diverse roles in signaling and development that warrants further investigation.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Caleosins are calcium-binding proteins encoded by small gene families in plants, and some members of the gene family have been shown to play an important role in signaling and in the response to stress. Ta-<italic>Clo3</italic> encoded by a member of this gene family in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum),</italic> was shown to have GAP activity with the heterotrimeric G protein subunit, G&#x3B1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The caleosins do not have significant sequence similarity with the Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) in other species and appear to be a new class of proteins that act as heterotrimeric G protein GAPs. The wheat Clo3 was also shown to interact with phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C1 (PI-PLC1) <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the interaction between Clo3, G&#x3B1; and PI-PLC1 was found to be competitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A homolog of Ta-<italic>Clo3</italic> in Arabidopsis, At-<italic>Clo3</italic>, also known as Responsive to Dehydration 20 (RD20), has been shown to be strongly induced by drought, abscisic acid and high salinity and was experimentally shown to bind calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The <italic>clo3</italic>/<italic>rd20</italic> mutants in Arabidopsis showed enhanced sensitivity to drought conditions and <italic>RD20</italic> was implicated in the control of stomata aperture, reduction of growth, and increased transpirational efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Plants&#x2019; responses to water deficit are known to activate signal transduction cascades that increase the level of secondary messengers, including calcium, thus some members of the caleosin gene family appear to play a critical role in water deficit signaling and to link calcium regulation to G protein signaling. Analysis of caleosins in barley also suggests a role in lipid trafficking and membrane expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The caleosin assembled oil bodies have been proposed as useful components of a nano-carrier for therapeutic purposes, and have been specifically used as drug carriers, targeting cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is unknown if the role of caleosins in the stress response is related to their role in lipid bodies, or if they are simply different functions carried out by different members of the gene families. Caleosins comprise a gene family of seven members in Arabidopsis and the rice genome contains five gene family members.</p>
      <p>Bread wheat, <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, is one of the most important cereal species grown world-wide. It is an allohexaploid, derived from two polyploidization events. The first hybridization between the diploid <italic>T. urartu</italic> and an unknown species thought to be closely related to <italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic>, which contributed the A and B genomes, respectively, occurred approximately 500,000&#xA0;years ago. The tetraploid species was domesticated as <italic>T. turgidum</italic>, commonly known as pasta wheat. The second polyploidization occurred between <italic>T. turgidum</italic> and <italic>Aegilops tauchii</italic>, the D genome progenitor, approximately 8,000&#xA0;years ago. <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>, barley, and <italic>Secale cereale</italic>, rye, are closely related crop species that belong to the tribe Triticeae, estimated to have diverged from the <italic>Triticum-Aegilops</italic> lineage 11 and 7 MYA, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Hexaploid triticale (x <italic>Triticosecale</italic>) is a synthetic hybrid crop species first developed in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century by crosses between <italic>Secale cereale</italic> and <italic>T. turgidum</italic>, and contains A, B, and R genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Triticale, grown largely for livestock feed, as well as for human consumption, has an important potential as a crop, especially under conditions that are less favorable for wheat cultivation, such as marginal soils in drought-prone regions. Generally, it combines the grain quality and yield potential of wheat with the environmental stress and disease tolerance of rye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Compared to wheat, triticale appears to have a higher resistance to many wheat fungal diseases and pests, as well as viral diseases. In addition to tolerance to conditions of drought, triticale varieties are able to adapt to stress conditions such as excess moisture and acidic soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Triticale is also an important model for investigation of the rapid changes involving genomic remodeling and changes in gene expression subsequent to polyploidization.</p>
      <p>In order to facilitate the analysis of the members of the caleosin gene family and investigate the diverse roles these proteins may play in signaling, we report a description of the whole gene family in hexaploid wheat, diploid rye, and triticale, based on analysis of high-throughput cDNA sequencing data sets and compare these to the other diploid species including barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare)</italic>, <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, rice, and Arabidopsis.</p>

          <title>Triticum aestivum</title>
          <p>The calcium binding protein Ta-Clo3/J900 from wheat was used for BLASTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] searches in the GenBank NR databases for related caleosin gene sequences in Arabidopsis and rice. The complete set of Arabidopsis and rice caleosin amino acid sequences, as well as that of the Ta-Clo3 were then used to search, with tBLASTn, for related sequences in the GenBank EST database for <italic>T. aestivum</italic>. The EST sequences were assembled into contigs using CAP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] under high stringency parameters of a minimum sequence identity of 98%; minimum overlap length of 40&#xA0;nt; gap penalty, 6; match value, 2; mismatch penalty (&#x2212;5). Open reading frames and translation of the contigs were carried out with the ExPASy translate tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and confirmed by BLASTx with the GenBank NR database comparison to related sequences, as well as by comparison among the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> caleosin sequences as the data set was developed. Contigs were manually edited to obtain full length cDNA sequences by first identifying any partial length contigs by BLASTx to the NR database and then identify additional ESTs with 100% identity and a minimum overlap of 120&#xA0;nt in the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> EST database at NCBI. ESTs were selected which could extend the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the initial contig. CAP3 was used to assemble all ESTs together with partial sequences to generate full-length contigs. After an initial set of contigs were completed, the process was reiterated to identify additional ESTs and additional homeologous members of the gene family that were not represented in the initial contig set. The <italic>T. aestivum</italic> caleosin contigs were used to search the Wheat Survey Sequences (WSS) of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] in order to identify the chromosome or chromosome arm on which the gene was located. One cDNA, <italic>Clo4-B</italic>, not represented in the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> GenBank EST database, was assembled independently from 454 (Roche) cDNA sequences of triticale and from matches of the homeologous <italic>Clo4-A</italic> to the WSS genomic wheat sequence database.</p>

          <title>Secale cereale</title>
          <p>Eleven paralogous wheat caleosin genes were used to search for orthologs in five 454-cDNA rye libraries obtained from anther, pistil, crown, roots, and stem, using BLASTn. All 454-cDNAs that matched to wheat caleosin genes with a minimum overlap of 100&#xA0;nt were selected as caleosin homologs regardless of their BLASTn scores or percent identities. The selected candidates of rye 454-cDNAs were assembled using CAP3 with the same parameters as described above for <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, except the minimum overlap length was set at 35&#xA0;nt. Using these high stringency assembly parameters, the CAP3 assembly yielded 45 contigs. The preliminary set of contigs was searched with the eleven wheat paralogs using BLASTn to eliminate duplicates and to select contigs with the longest contig length and highest sequence similarity. Contigs assembled with a low depth of coverage were individually compared to the rye 454-cDNAs to confirm the accuracy of their assemblies.</p>

          <title>Hordeum vulgare</title>
          <p>The 11 paralogous caleosin gene sequences of wheat were used to search in the GeneBank databases for homologous genes in barley (<italic>H. vulgare)</italic>, the best characterized member of the Triticeae. Gene sequences were identified for eight of these genes in the nr database of full length nucleotide sequences. The sequence of Hv-<italic>Clo9</italic> [GenBank:AK375872.1] had a frame-shift error that became apparent by comparison to the wheat orthologs; the sequences were corrected by comparison to sequences in the GenBank barley EST database. An additional barley caleosin, Hv-<italic>Clo8</italic>, was assembled from EST sequences in the GenBank EST database. Another contig, Hv-<italic>Clo11</italic> was identified in the second generation sequence database for barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] by a BLASTn search of the assembly 1 morex rcba database. In the latter case, the tentative barley transcript was manually assembled from the output of the BLASTn alignment of the barley subject sequence detected by the wheat Ta-<italic>Clo11</italic> caleosin query sequence.</p>

The complete caleosin gene sequence and coding sequences were acquired in FASTA format and were translated with the ExPASy Translate tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In cases where the original annotation appears to have misidentified the exon/intron junctions or start codons, the flanking sequence for the annotated gene region was reanalyzed and annotated manually by searching for extended ORFs and sequence similarity to the caleosin protein sequences from <italic>T. aestivum.</italic></p>

        <title>Caleosin genes conserved domains and family phylogenetic tree</title>
        <p>The most conserved region of the gene family was determined by using NCBI Batch Conserved Domain Search Tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] for all contigs, and the result was confirmed with conservation scores calculated by JasView. The calcium binding domain EF-hand motif was identified by alignment of all contigs with EF-hand motifs (1XO5, 1NYA) and calcium binding proteins (1TIZ, 1NKF, 3OX6) obtained from the Protein Data Bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The results were verified based on the EF-hand motif in Arabidopsis, described by Takahashi and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The structural and functional features of caleosin genes were examined using InterPro Scan Sequence Search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in genomic mode. These two programs were used in parallel to support the result from the NCBI Search Tool and to verify the presence of the EF-hand motif.</p>
        <p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed using wheat caleosin nucleotide sequences aligned using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA), version 5.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The maximum likelihood method was employed based on the Jukes-Cantor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows: When the number of common sites was&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+<italic>G</italic>, parameter&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.2379)). The analysis involved 35 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 510 positions in the final dataset.</p>
        <p>Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction for caleosins from six species were performed using MEGA, version 5.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Sequence comparisons were based on the 174 amino acid caleosin domain of protein sequences from eleven paralogous <italic>Clo</italic> genes (one representative of each homeologous gene groups) of hexaploid <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, and the gene sequences from the diploid species: <italic>H. vulgare</italic>, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and <italic>S. cereale</italic> as well as those of <italic>O. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The amino acid sequences from the six species were aligned using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method based on the Whelan and Goldman (WAG) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring probability distributions to assign probabilities to possible phylogenetic trees. The WAG model for amino acids was employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], an empirical model of globular protein evolution. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as described above. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+<italic>G</italic>, parameter&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0411)). The analysis involved 54 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 93 amino acid positions included in the final dataset.</p>

        <title>Caleosin expression analysis</title>
        <p>The relative level of expression of caleosin gene family members in rye and in triticale was determined by analysis of Roche 454-cDNA sequence libraries. A description of the analysis is presented as a flowchart (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1). 454-cDNA reads were converted from 454-sff format to FASTQ format using Galaxy server from Penn State and Emory University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The high quality transcripts obtained from triticale and rye tissues were aligned to their associated wheat, rye, and triticale caleosin reference sequences using the CD-HIT-EST-2D biological sequence clustering algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] using default parameters and a word size of n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5, and a similarity cutoff of 97%. The reads that were uniquely mapped to each homeolog were selected and counted. The expression of rye and triticale cDNA reads in 454 libraries was normalized to reads per kilobase of gene length per million reads to correct the biases from differences in the gene lengths and to normalize the expression among libraries of different sizes. To characterize expression in stem tissue, cDNA libraries were made from three genotypes sampled at two times of development. Analysis by two-way ANOVA showed no significant differences in expression for caleosins among genotypes or between times of development; these six libraries were therefore used as replicates, and the data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. The number of replicates for each of the other tissues is listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2.</p>
        <p>The relative level of tissue-specific expression for caleosin gene family members in wheat and in barley was determined by analysis of datasets from a 61&#xA0;K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and a 22&#xA0;K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] Affymetrix microarray, respectively, available at the PLEXdb database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The relative level of gene expression in triticale in response to osmotic stress given as PEG treatments was analyzed by comparison of 454 data sets from treated and control plants. The changes in gene expression in rye roots in response to salt treatment were analyzed from 454 sequence libraries with the CD-HIT algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The effect of cold stress on the expression of caleosin family members was analyzed in the microarray data set of Monroy et al.

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>A two-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in levels of caleosin gene expression among genotypes, or between developmental stages of triticale stem and anther tissues. The statistical significance of the difference in the levels of expression among the different caleosin gene family members in each rye and triticale tissue was tested by a one-way ANOVA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range test was used to determine which caleosin genes expressed differ significantly within each tissue type. A &#x3C7;2 contingency test was also used to test the significance of the difference between the level of expression of the R genome copy of caleosin genes in rye and in triticale, based on the null hypothesis that the level of individual R genome caleosin transcripts in triticale was not different than one third of the level of expression of the genes in rye. One-way ANOVA was used to test the significance of the differences in caleosin gene expression from microarray data. Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range test was used to determine which caleosin genes expressed differ significantly across a panel of different tissues analyzed. Duncan&#x2019;s test was also used to determine which caleosin genes expressed in barley crown tissue under control or ABA treatment conditions differ significantly. Note that the Affymetrix wheat microarray data does not distinguish between the homeologs within paralogous groups.</p>

        <p>CAP3 assembly parameters ranging from 80% (default) to 99% identity were evaluated for the assembly of gene family members from hexaploid wheat and the optimal value was determined to be 98%. Assembly at a lower minimum percent identity resulted in contigs that included sequences from different homeologous gene copies.

        <p>Among the species surveyed, hexaploid <italic>T. aestivum</italic> had the largest caleosin gene family with 11 gene family members per haploid genome.

        <p>The accuracy of each contig sequence was judged to be excellent, as the contigs generally had a minimum depth of at least three ESTs and many had a depth of four to ten sequences. There was also a very good agreement between the contigs assembled from EST sequences, sequences of individual cDNA clones and the WSS assemblies, which indicates the high accuracy of the WSS database. Genes within homeologous groups had high nucleotide sequence similarity, ranging from 96% to 97% nucleotide sequence identity within the coding region. This high degree of similarity is common among homeologous copies of genes in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The WSS sequences are derived from shotgun 454 sequencing of chromosome arm specific BAC libraries, thus sequences have a chromosomal assignment, but not map location along the chromosomes. In nearly all cases, homeologous copies of genes were located on the same arm of homeologous chromosomes. One exception is <italic>Clo9</italic>. The A and D genome copies of <italic>Clo9</italic> are located on the short arm and long arm of chromosome 4A and 4D, which are considered homeologous, the B genome copy is located on the short arm of 4B which is not homeologous to the other two chromosome arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Ten of the 11 paralogous groups had three homeologous copies, but the caleosin 10 had four gene copies, one on each of the long arms of chromosome 2A and 2B and two copies identified on chromosome 2DL. These two copies of <italic>Clo10</italic> on 2DL had 93%&#xA0;nt sequence identity within the coding region, which is somewhat lower than the sequence identity among the homeologous copies on chromosomes 2A and 2B and one of the D copies, <italic>Clo10-2D</italic>.</p>
        <p>The degree of similarity among the paralogous sequences of wheat spanned a wide range; the most similar paralogs were <italic>Clo10</italic> and <italic>Clo11</italic> which shared 89% nucleotide sequence identity and 95% amino acid sequence similarity within the conserved 174 EF-hand domain. The most dissimilar members of the wheat caleosins gene family were <italic>Clo10</italic> and <italic>Clo4</italic> which had 37% amino acid sequence identity and 57% similarity within the conserved domain. The size of the proteins encoded by members of the gene family ranged from 198 to 302 amino acids. All members of the gene family are characterized by the presence of a single EF-hand calcium binding region of approximately 174 amino acids and a predicted transmembrane domain of 20 amino acids.</p>

        <p>Caleosin gene family members were detected in all tissues sampled, and most tissues showed the expression of several paralogous members of the gene family. Expression of three caleosin members (<italic>Clo5, Clo7, and Clo9</italic>) were detected in rye root tissue, with the expression of <italic>Clo9</italic> being dominant, and <italic>Clo5</italic> and <italic>Clo7</italic> detected at very low levels (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Most caleosin transcripts were detected in multiple tissues; however, <italic>Clo6</italic> and <italic>Clo10</italic> were only detected in anther tissue, with <italic>Clo6</italic> detected at relatively high levels (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S3), demonstrating high tissue specificity for these caleosin members. In contrast, <italic>Clo5</italic> and <italic>Clo7</italic> were detected in all four tissues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S3).</p>
        <p>Triticale showed a similar diversity of expression of all gene family members. Among the five tissue types included in the analysis, anther tissue was sampled at two stages of development: UNM (uninucleate microspore) and TCP (tri-cellular pollen). A two-way ANOVA showed significant differences between expression of caleosin genes (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000), and also a significant interaction effect between gene and developmental stage (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000), indicating that there is a different level of caleosin gene expression at different stages of anther development. Expression of only two caleosin genes were detected in triticale pollen (<italic>Clo2,</italic> and <italic>Clo6</italic>), and stigma tissues (<italic>Clo7</italic> and <italic>Clo8</italic>), and expression of five caleosin genes (<italic>Clo2, Clo5</italic>, <italic>Clo6, Clo7</italic> and <italic>Clo9</italic>) were detected in root tissue, with <italic>Clo7</italic> and <italic>Clo9</italic> expression being dominant (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). <italic>Clo7</italic> and <italic>Clo9</italic> expression was also dominant in stem tissue, and <italic>Clo7</italic> was found to show a broad tissue expression pattern, as it was detected in four of the tissues investigated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S4). In anthers, <italic>Clo7</italic> showed high expression specifically at the UNM stage, whereas it was not detected at the TCP stage. Conversely, <italic>Clo11</italic> was observed to be primarily expressed at the TCP stage, and to a lesser extent at the UNM stage of anther development (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, there is tissue specificity for certain caleosin members, as was observed with expression in rye tissues.

Eight of the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> caleosins are represented on the wheat 61&#xA0;K Affymetrix microarray, similarly nine of the barley caleosins are represented on the 22&#xA0;K Affymetrix microarray. Gene expression in multiple tissues and stages of development was assayed in <italic>T. aestivum</italic> by Schreiber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and in barley by Druka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The wheat data shows a diversity of expression of caleosin family members in the tissues assayed, and appears to partially corroborate rye and triticale expression results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5). The wheat microarray data reveals that the <italic>Clo9</italic> paralog is relatively highly expressed in root tissue (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5), as was found in rye and triticale expression data described above. The wheat microarray data also reveals relatively high expression of the <italic>Clo7</italic> paralog across tissues, in agreement with the expression data for triticale. Both <italic>Clo6</italic> and <italic>Clo7</italic> paralogs showed relatively high expression in anther tissue in the wheat microarray data, (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5) which was similar to the observations in the 454 sequence data from both rye and triticale, although <italic>Clo7</italic> was expressed significantly less than <italic>Clo6</italic> in rye anther (Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Such differences in expression may be accounted for by differences in experimental design, stages of development, or may reflect species differences.</p>
        <p>The barley microarray data reveals that both <italic>Clo7 and Clo9</italic> paralogs are relatively highly expressed in root tissue (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S6), which is in agreement with the 454 expression data for triticale (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). <italic>Clo9</italic> was also highly expressed in rye roots, but <italic>Clo7</italic> was expressed at significantly lower levels in the same tissue (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). <italic>Clo8</italic> was also seen to be expressed at high levels in the roots of barley in the microarray data, but not in the roots of rye and triticale in the 454 sequence sets. <italic>Clo6</italic> and <italic>Clo10</italic> are highly expressed in barley anther tissue as well as in the anthers of both rye and triticale; however, 454 data for rye and triticale shows high expression of additional family members in anther tissue (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S6, Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). <italic>Clo4</italic> showed no significant expression in any of the tissues assayed in the barley microarray data which parallels results from rye and triticale (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S6, Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

In addition there were differences in gene expression between the microarray data of wheat and barley, for example, several caleosins showed significant expression in wheat pistils but not in the same tissue in barley.

Previously published microarray analysis also sheds light on the involvement of caleosins in the stress response. The microarray analysis of cold acclimation in wheat by Monroy et al.

In stem tissue, the most striking differences between the two species was <italic>Clo11-R</italic>, which was the most highly expressed caleosin in rye stems, but was expressed at low levels in triticale as were the A and B genome copies of <italic>Clo11</italic>(Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). <italic>Clo4-R</italic> was not detected in rye stem tissue but was expressed in moderate levels in triticale stems (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), thus <italic>Clo11-R</italic> appears to have been suppressed and <italic>Clo4-R</italic> appears to have been activated by the polyploidization event. In anthers, the relative level of expression of most caleosin gene R homeologs was lower in triticale than in rye, and some rye genes showed especially marked differences in expression in the two species. <italic>Clo10-R</italic> and <italic>Clo6-R</italic> were highly expressed in rye, whereas <italic>Clo10-R</italic> was not detected in triticale, indicating a loss of expression in the R genome of triticale in anthers (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). <italic>Clo6-R</italic> also had very low levels of expression in triticale (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). <italic>Clo8-R</italic> was detected in rye anthers but not in triticale anthers (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B); however, the level of expression was relatively low in rye, thus loss of expression in triticale could not be assessed with confidence.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>A comparison of</bold><bold><italic>Clo</italic></bold><bold>gene expression in rye and triticale, to assay the changes in gene expression as a result of polyploidization.</bold> The expression of caleosin gene family members was measured using RNA-seq analysis in the stem <bold>(A)</bold>, and anther <bold>(B)</bold>, of rye and triticale, respectively.

        <title>The caleosin gene family</title>
        <p>The 11 paralogous groups of caleosin genes present in <italic>T. aestivum</italic> represents the largest gene family for caleosins among the seven species included in this analysis. Though the entire wheat genome has not yet been completely sequenced, the description of the caleosin gene family appears to be complete or nearly so, since orthologs for all caleosins detected in rye, barley and Brachypodium were also found in wheat. In addition, three homeologous copies for each paralogous group were detected in wheat as well as a fourth member of the <italic>Clo10</italic> group. All 32 of the wheat caleosin genes identified in the EST databases at GenBank were also identified in the WSS and two additional genes, <italic>Clo4-B</italic> and <italic>Clo11-A</italic>, that were not represented in the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> EST database at GenBank were identified in the WSS. This indicates that the depth of the WSS is very comprehensive. The wheat caleosin genes were also represented in the whole genome sequencing database (Genbank Whole-genome shotgun contigs database) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Brachypodium, the most closely related monocot species with a completed and annotated genome sequence available, has seven caleosin genes and rice has six caleosin genes. All caleosin genes in rice and Brachypodium have orthologous sequences in wheat, barley and rye, as judged by sequence similarity, and seen in the phylogram in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Since these more distantly related species have gene family members which share branches with sequences from wheat throughout the tree, it seems that the representation of caleosins from wheat is likely complete. The larger number of caleosin genes in Triticeae, supported by identified sequences from wheat, rye and barley, and the representation of genes from <italic>Oryza</italic> on the major sub-branches in the phylogram indicate that the Triticeae had five gene duplications after the evolutionary separation from the <italic>Oryza,</italic> and before the separation of the three wheat progenitor species from each other. These duplications in the Triticeae lineage after the separation from rice are the <italic>Clo3</italic> and <italic>Clo4</italic> duplication, the <italic>Clo5</italic> and <italic>Clo6</italic> duplication, the <italic>Clo7</italic> and <italic>Clo8</italic> duplication, and the <italic>Clo2</italic> and <italic>Clo10</italic> duplication, and subsequently the <italic>Clo10</italic> and <italic>Clo11</italic> duplication. The localization of these putative gene duplications on the same chromosomes supports this notion, since gene duplications often occur as tandem duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], though further investigation would be required to demonstrate that the duplications were in tandem. Hv-<italic>Clo3</italic> was not identified in the barley data sets in GenBank; this may represent gene loss, loss of gene expression or may be due to incomplete transcriptome or genome sequence from these species in the current databases. The lack of a full length sequence for the rye <italic>Clo2</italic>, but the presence of a gene sequence fragment for it in a high throughput sequence database is indicative of the advanced but still incomplete state of the sequencing for these species. The length of the branches in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, are scaled according to amino acid differences between sequences, thus providing an estimate of evolutionary distance. The duplication of <italic>Clo10</italic> and <italic>Clo11</italic> appear to have happened more recently than other duplications, and the presence of <italic>Clo10</italic> and <italic>Clo11</italic> only in wheat, rye and barley provides supporting evidence for duplication only after the separation from the <italic>Brachypodium lineage</italic>. A similar evolutionary pattern is also observed for <italic>Clo5</italic> and <italic>Clo6</italic>, though that duplication appears to be older than the <italic>Clo10</italic>, <italic>Clo11</italic> duplication.</p>
        <p>In Brachypodium, Bd-<italic>Clo1</italic> and two copies of <italic>Clo2</italic> (Bd-<italic>Clo2-A</italic>, and Bd-<italic>Clo2-B</italic>) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; Bradi5g15410, Bradi5g15417, and Bradi5g15427) are identified as tandem duplications. In addition, Bd-<italic>Clo3-A</italic> (Bradi1g70390) and Bd-<italic>Clo4</italic> (Bradi1g70400) are also adjacent to each other. However <italic>Clo3-A</italic> and <italic>Clo3-B</italic> which share high sequence similarity and are both on chromosome 1, are not closely linked. Brachypodium provides evidence for both recent and old tandem duplications for caleosins as well as relatively recent non-tandem duplications. Arabidopsis&#x2019; caleosin genes are largely clustered together in the phylogenetic tree suggesting that gene duplication events occurred independently in the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous branches of the tree.</p>

        <title>Variation of caleosin gene expression in plant tissues</title>
        <p>The diverse expression profile of the caleosin genes in rye and triticale tissues, as well as in wheat and barley tissues, suggests that these calcium binding proteins likely play a broad role during plant development. Whereas some caleosins exhibited more restricted, tissue-specific patterns of expression, such as <italic>Clo6</italic> and <italic>Clo10</italic>, others such as <italic>Clo7</italic>, were detected in almost all rye and triticale tissues sampled. It is therefore conceivable that some caleosins may have a more general, &#x2018;housekeeping&#x2019; role in most plant tissues and cell types, whereas other caleosins may have tissue- and cell-type specific roles in signaling and regulation during plant development. Evidence that <italic>Clo3</italic> in wheat acts as a GAP for the &#x3B1;-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], raises the possibility that members of the gene family may play key roles in signaling. The expression of other calcium-binding proteins in plants that function in all cell types or that have more restricted, tissue-specific functions, have been previously reported. For example, calmodulin, the predominant Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, plays a critical role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures into proper cellular responses in numerous tissue types and cellular compartments in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Six members of the calmodulin-like protein gene family are expressed in a developmentally controlled pattern during nodulation in the roots of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and a kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein, was found to be selectively expressed in the flowers, roots, and leaves of Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
        <p>Although <italic>T. aestivum Clo3</italic> was found to be expressed in several triticale and rye tissues, there was no expression in several tissues analyzed. Although these results are in agreement with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], demonstrating that the expression of At-<italic>Clo3</italic>, the ortholog of Ta-<italic>Clo3</italic>, was undetectable in Arabidopsis root using northern analysis, we have detected expression in Arabidopsis in response to abscisic acid treatment [unpublished observations] using transgenic plants with promoter:Gus gene constructs. This underscores the challenges of tissue-specific expression analysis, since expression can be regulated developmentally, as well as by other factors such as environmental conditions and hormonal fluxes, and may not be identified in the tissue samples taken at a limited number of time points of development that are represented in the cDNA sequence databases. The induction and repression of several caleosin gene family members in response to salt stress, cold acclimation and osmotic stress implies a wide role for members of the gene family in the environmental stress response. These observations warrant a more in-depth analysis of the tissue specificity and the time course for the changes in gene expression. Further study of potential partners in protein-protein interaction is also warranted, since <italic>Clo3</italic> of wheat has previously been shown to interact with both the &#x3B1;-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex as well as members of the PI-PLC gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the gene expression results demonstrate the effect of polyploidization on the expression of R subgenome caleosins. The synthetic triticale is an intergeneric allohexaploid generated from <italic>Triticum durum</italic> and rye. The initial combination of two or more genomes in one organism may lead to considerable genomic reorganization and changes in gene expression relative to the parental species. Soon after polyploidization, triticale underwent a loss of its combined DNA content in the range of 22 to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and DNA elimination of repetitive DNA and low-copy sequences from the rye genome in triticale have been reported in molecular studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The effect of polyploidization was clearly observed in the case of several caleosins, such as the expression of the rye homeologs <italic>Clo6-R</italic> and <italic>Clo10-R</italic>, in triticale. The rye <italic>Clo6-R</italic> and <italic>Clo10-R</italic> homeologs were found to be suppressed in anthers, although expression of these caleosins were relatively high in the corresponding rye tissues. Tissue-specific silencing of homeologs from one of the genomes of polyploid species has been reported in other allopolyploids including <italic>Tragopogon miscellus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], though the mechanisms that lead to suppression are somewhat speculative at this point. Since these genes are expressed in other triticale tissues, gene deletion is clearly not the explanation for suppression, and mechanisms related to chromatin remodelling or the incompatibility of signaling and regulation pathways of parental genomes in newly derived polyploids warrants investigation.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>An apparent full set of wheat caleosin gene sequences were acquired as full length cDNAs, the open reading frames were identified, and the peptide sequences were obtained. The gene sequences were confirmed with the WSS database. One member of the caleosin gene family, <italic>Clo3</italic>, has previously been identified as a stress inducible gene encoding a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein that acts as a negative regulator of the &#x3B1; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein GA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The identification and full description of the gene family for caleosins can be a significant step in further investigating the role of members of this gene family in signaling and regulation. The very diverse pattern of tissue-specific expression indicates a potential for a very broad role in signaling and regulation throughout plant development.</p>

      <title>Availability of supporting data</title>
      <p>The full set of full length caleosin cDNA sequences for wheat and rye can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>. The corrected Hv-<italic>Clo6</italic> cDNA of <italic>H. vulgare</italic> sequence and Hv-<italic>Clo8</italic> derived from ESTs and the Brachypodium sequence Bradi1g70400 with an extended CDS are included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">17</xref>. In addition, thirty one wheat caleosin sequences are being deposited at GenBank; seven of these are derived from direct sequencing of cDNA clones and have been deposited in the nr database with accession numbers HQ020505 and KJ523887 to KJ523892; 25 of these are derived from assembly of EST sequences and are being deposited at GenBank as Third Party Annotations (TPA). Five sequences are derived from triticale 454 EST libraries which are identical to <italic>T. aestivum</italic> caleosins and are being submitted to the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database. Three wheat caleosin mRNA (i.e. cDNA) equivalent sequences Ta-<italic>Clo4-B</italic>, Ta-<italic>Clo10-2-D</italic>, Ta-<italic>Clo11-A</italic> were derived from genomic sequences at the WSS database and do not qualify for deposit at GenBank. The ten <italic>Secale cereale</italic> caleosin sequences derived from 454 cDNA sequences are being deposited in the TSA database at GenBank. The raw <italic>Secale cereale</italic> 454 sequences have been deposited at the DNA Data Bank of Japan with identifier DRA000384.</p>
