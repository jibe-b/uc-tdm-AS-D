        <p>Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyses the final step in the biosynthesis of monolignols. In the present study, a cDNA encoding a CAD was isolated from wheat, designated as <italic>TaCAD1</italic>. A genome-wide data mining in the wheat EST database revealed another 10 CAD-like homologues, namely TaCAD2 to TaCAD11. A phylogenetic analysis showed that TaCAD1 belonged to the <italic>bona fide</italic> CAD group involved in lignin synthesis. Two other putative CADs from the wheat genome (TaCAD2 and TaCAD4) also belonged to this group and were very close to TaCAD1, but lacked C-terminal domain, suggesting that they are pseudogenes. DNA gel blot analysis for the wheat genome showed two to three copies of <italic>CAD</italic> related to <italic>TaCAD1</italic>, but RNA gel blot analysis revealed only single band for <italic>TaCAD1</italic>, which was highly expressed in stem, with quite low expression in leaf and undetectable expression in root. The predicted three-dimension structure of TaCAD1 resembled that of AtCAD5, but two amino acid substitutions were identified in the substrate binding region. Recombinant TaCAD1 protein used coniferyl aldehyde as the most favoured substrate, also showed high efficiencies toward sinapyl and <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl aldehydes. TaCAD1 was an enzyme being pH-dependent and temperature-sensitive, and showing a typical random catalysing mechanism. At the milky stage of wheat, TaCAD1 mRNA abundance, protein level and enzyme activity in stem tissues were higher in a lodging-resistant cultivar (H4546) than in lodging-sensitive cultivar (C6001). These properties were correlated to the lignin contents and lodging indices of the two cultivars. These data suggest that TaCAD1 is the predominant CAD in wheat stem for lignin biosynthesis and is critical for lodging resistance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lignin is frequently a major structural component of secondary cell walls in vascular plants, conferring mechanical strength as well as hydrophobicity to the plant body. Lignin is derived from dehydrogenative polymerization of lignin subunits (monolignols); the three main monolignols being <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. The biochemical pathway leading to the formation of monolignols consists of successive hydroxylation and <italic>O</italic>-methylation of the aromatic ring before conversion of the side-chain carboxyl to an alcohol function. Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD, EC 1.1.1.195) catalyses the conversion of the corresponding cinnamyl aldehydes to cinnamyl alcohols; this is the last step in the synthesis of monolignols before their polymerization in cell walls. Hence CAD is a key enzyme in monolignol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baucher <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), which has been characterized in many plant species, including <italic>Aralia cordata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hibino <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>), <italic>Eucalyptus gunnii</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>globulus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawkins and Boudet, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), loblolly pine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Malley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>), lucerne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brill <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), poplar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Van Doorsselaere <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), and strawberry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanco-Portales <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). According to these data, CAD displays distinct features between gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperm CAD is encoded by a single gene, and is believed to be highly specific for the reduction of coniferyl aldehyde, and with lower catalytic activity toward sinapyl aldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Malley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galliano <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). On the contrary, angiosperm CAD has multiple isoforms that have significant affinity for both coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brill <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). An <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome has identified nine CAD-homologues, but only three (AtCAD5, AtCAD4, and AtCAD1) were demonstrated to be the main enzymes involved in monolignol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sibout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eudes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The functions of other isoforms remain elusive.</p>
      <p>There are only a few reports on CAD from monocot plants. CAD cDNAs have been isolated from ryegrass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lynch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), sugarcane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selman-Housein <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), and sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsuruta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Some <italic>brown-midrib</italic> mutants from maize and sorghum have been characterized; these mutations were shown directly to affect CAD expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saballos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sattler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). By a map-based cloning approach to the <italic>gh2</italic> (<italic>Gold Hull and Internode 2</italic>) rice mutant, this gene was shown to encode a CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recently, 12 and 14 CAD homologues were identified in the genomes of rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tobias and Chowk, 2005</xref>) and sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saballos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), respectively. OsCAD2 and SbCAD2 have been shown to be responsible for lignin biosynthesis, being related to hull and internode phenotypes in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sattler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), respectively. There is much to learn about CADs in monocot plants.</p>
      <p>We are particularly interested in lignin biosynthesis in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.). Wheat crops provide not only the number one food grain for humans, but also an important lignocellulosic biomass, the straw. In China alone, annual production of wheat straw exceeds 147 mt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Lignin determines the quality of wheat straw as a valuable biomass. More importantly, lignin is a factor of crop lodging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma, 2009</xref>). The biochemical characterization and physiological analyses of cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) and caffeic acid <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (COMT) from wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma and Xu, 2008</xref>) have previously been reported. Here, the characterization of another important lignin biosynthetic gene, CAD, and its functions in wheat stem development and lodging-resistance is reported.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the wheat CAD</title>
        <p>RT-PCR with degenerate primers for CAD produced a 660 bp cDNA fragment. Using this fragment as a probe, coupled with high-stringency hybridization, five positive plaques were detected in the wheat stem cDNA library. Restriction analysis showed that all these isolates had the same restriction fragment pattern. DNA sequence analysis showed that they belonged to the same cDNA, which was designated as TaCAD1 (GenBank accession no GU563724). This cDNA was 1311 nucleotides in length with a 1083-nucleotide open reading frame (ORF), flanked by 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; untranslated regions of 87 and 141 nucleotides, respectively. The GC content of the ORF was 66.1%, which is similar to that of other monocot CAD genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell and Gowri, 1990</xref>). The deduced translation product of <italic>TaCAD1</italic> consists of 360 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 38 624 Da and a theoretical isolectric point of 5.926.</p>
        <p>The deduced amino acid sequence contained a highly conserved motif in CAD, <sup>188</sup>GLGGVG<sup>193</sup>, which is known to participate in binding the pyrophosphate group of NADP<sup>+</sup> through a helical dipole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Youn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In AtCAD5 (from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), there is a putative, substrate-binding pocket of 12 residues: T<sup>49</sup>, Q<sup>53</sup>, L<sup>58</sup>, M<sup>60</sup>, C<sup>95</sup>, W<sup>119</sup>, V<sup>276</sup>, P<sup>286</sup>, M<sup>289</sup>, L<sup>290</sup>, F<sup>299</sup>, and I<sup>300</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Youn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In TaCAD1, only two residues were different; A<sup>60</sup> and V<sup>95</sup>.</p>
        <p>Since the wheat genome is not yet fully sequenced, the wheat EST database was used to identify CAD-like sequences with the TaCAD1 amino acid sequence as a query. Ten putative CAD of full-length isoforms were obtained, they were named TaCAD2, TaCAD3,&#x2026; TaCAD11. These 11 wheat CAD sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, along with CAD sequences from a few other plants. The tree revealed six groups of CAD (nomenclature of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saballos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Group I contained sequences identified as the <italic>bona fide</italic> CAD enzymes from gymnosperms, monocot and dicot angiosperms. A majority of these CADs have been demonstrated to be involved in lignin biosynthesis. This group is further divided into three subgroups, which included CADs from dicots, monocots, and gymnosperms, respectively. Group II contained CAD sequences from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, alfalfa, and poplar. It is worth noting that a sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD) from poplar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) is a member of this group, although this type of enzyme has not been identified from other angiosperms. Groups III and IV represent CAD sequences from monocot plants. OsCAD7 in group IV has been shown to affect the culm strength of rice in a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Group V contained CAD sequences from rice, sorghum, and wheat, and also included AtCAD1. The latter has been demonstrated partly to complement <italic>AtCAD4</italic> and <italic>AtCAD5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eudes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Group VI, which was a new group identified in the present analysis, included OsCAD6, TaCAD7, TaCAD8, and TaCAD9. It is still questionable for this group as the sequence resources are probably too limited for definitive conclusions.</p>
        <p>There were three wheat CAD sequences in Group I. TaCAD2 and TaCAD1 were closely related. Although sequence comparison revealed a major difference between the two, with TaCAD2 lacking about 40 amino acids in its C-terminus, the identity in the rest of the amino acid sequences was over 94%. TaCAD2 is possibly a pseudogene of TaCAD1. A third wheat CAD in this group is TaCAD4. It has only 217 amino acids and has diverged from other <italic>bona fide</italic> CAD enzymes from monocot plants. The functions of this CAD warrant investigation.</p>
        <p>Genomic DNA of wheat was digested with restriction enzymes <italic>Eco</italic>RI, <italic>Bam</italic>HI, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, or <italic>Xba</italic>I, to determine the copy number of <italic>TaCAD1</italic>. In TaCAD1 cDNA, there were no restriction sites for these enzymes. The blot was probed with the coding region of <italic>TaCAD1</italic>, and two strong bands were detected in <italic>Eco</italic>RI digestion, three bands each in <italic>Bam</italic>H1 and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII digestions, and four bands in the <italic>Xba</italic>I digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). These digestion patterns suggested that two or three copies of CAD genes were present in the wheat genome. This result is consistent with data from the wheat EST database, where two possible CAD isoforms (TaCAD2 and TaCAD4) are close to TaCAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Indeed, Northern blot analyses revealed a single band of the size of TaCAD1 cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). This indicated that <italic>TaCAD2</italic> and <italic>TaCAD4</italic> were either not expressed or could not be recognized by the <italic>TaCAD1</italic> probe. Results also showed that the <italic>TaCAD1</italic> transcript was most abundant in stem tissues and with a much lower abundance in leaf tissues. No signal was detected in root tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Predicted secondary and three-dimensional structures of TaCAD1</title>
        <p>The predicted secondary and three-dimensional structures of TaCAD1 were very similar to AtCAD5 that had been analysed by crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Youn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/</ext-link> explore.cgi; pdbId: 2CF6). &#x3B1; helices and &#x3B2; sheets were the basic elements of the TaCAD1 structure, which were interlaced with random coils, bends, and turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). The whole protein of TaCAD1 was composed of the catalytic and nucleotide-binding domains, each with six helices plus 12 sheets and five helices plus five sheets of secondary elements. One major difference was that, in TaCAD1, a new helix element was predicted in residues <sup>286</sup>SPMVLG<sup>292</sup>, which was located between &#x3B2;E and &#x3B2;F. This interface was mainly due to several amino acid substitutions, which included L<sup>285</sup> to S, T<sup>286</sup> to S, L<sup>288</sup> to M, and L<sup>289</sup> to V. However, this new helix had merged with &#x3B2;E and appeared to have no influence on the whole TaCAD1 structure. Another difference between the two CADs involved two amino acids in the substrate binding site, where M<sup>60</sup> and C<sup>95</sup> in AtCAD5 were replaced by A<sup>60</sup> and V<sup>95</sup> in TaCAD1.</p>

        <title>Properties of the recombinant TaCAD1 enzyme</title>
        <p>TaCAD1 was expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as a His-tagged protein with a relative molecular mass of about 42.5 kDa. This protein was purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), and its kinetics toward the five possible substrates was analysed. The overall catalytic properties were revealed by <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>, and <italic>K</italic><sub>enz</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). According to the calculated catalytic efficiency (<italic>K</italic><sub>enz</sub>) of TaCAD1, it showed the lowest catalytic efficiencies towards 5-OH-coniferyl and caffeoyl aldehydes. Higher catalytic efficiencies were observed for sinapyl and <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl aldehydes, and an even higher efficiency was documented for coniferyl aldehyde. These results were consistent with the proposed pathway of these three substrates in the synthesis of syringyl, coumaryl, and guaiacyl subunits of lignin.</p>

        <p>The enzymatic activity of TaCAD1 was pH-dependent, as evaluated in phosphate potassium buffer using coniferyl aldehyde and NADPH as substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). TaCAD1 activity increased abruptly from pH 6.0 up to the optimal pH of 7.0. The enzyme still had &gt;70% of its maximum activity at pH 8.0, but at pH 9.0 its activity was almost completely stopped. This suggests that TaCAD1 is strictly pH-dependent and this optimal pH fit well with the cytosolic localization of CAD. A similar result was reported for native CAD enzyme from Japanese black pine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kutsuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>).</p>

It is already known that H4564 had stronger stems and a lower lodging index than C6001, and these were attributable to the higher lignin synthesis in H4564 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma, 2009</xref>).

        <title>TaCAD1 is the predominant CAD isoform responsible for lignin synthesis in the wheat stem</title>
        <p>CAD-like genes may exist in multiple isoforms, as revealed by genome-wide analyses from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and sorghum, but the numbers of the <italic>bona fide</italic> CAD enzymes known to be involved in lignin biosynthesis are rather limited. It is believed that there is one CAD enzyme in gymnosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Malley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>), and two or three CAD isoforms in each dicot species. For example, AtCAD5, AtCAD4, and AtCAD1 are the three main CADs that are responsible for lignin biosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sibout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eudes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>With Southern blot hybridization for wheat, two or three bands were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting the existence of two or three closely related TaCAD1 in the wheat genome. According to the wheat EST database, there are two possible CAD isoforms (TaCAD2 and TaCAD4) that may not have enzyme activity due to an incomplete C-terminus sequence (TaCAD2) or too short a peptide (TaCAD4). In addition, Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) and Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>) hybridizations showed one band corresponding to TaCAD1 in wheat. Similar situations are reported in other monocot plants. For example, three CAD cDNAs were identified from <italic>Lolium perenne</italic>, but only one (<italic>LpCAD3</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lynch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) belongs to the <italic>bona fide</italic> CAD family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). From rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tobias and Chowk, 2005</xref>) and sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saballos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), 12 and 14 CAD-like homologues were identified, respectively, but only one was showed to be responsible for lignin biosynthesis in either species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sattler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Taken together, it seems to be generally true that only one CAD is involved in lignin biosynthesis in monocot plants, as in gymnosperms, but unlike that in dicot plants.</p>
        <p>A recent report, however, showed the complex situation for CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A <italic>flexible culm1</italic> (<italic>fc1</italic>) mutant was obtained from rice and this mutation was located on the gene that was previously identified as <italic>OsCAD7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The <italic>fc1</italic> mutant caused a reduction in culm strength, as well as a decrease in CAD activity and lignin content. However, the amount of cellulose in <italic>fc1</italic> culms was almost equally reduced to that of lignin. The culm strength in the second internode was reduced more than that in the first internode, but CAD activity exhibited the inverse proportion to culm strength. Since OsCAD7 does not belong the <italic>bona fide</italic> CAD family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), its biochemical nature needs further identification. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>AtCAD1</italic> gene was shown partially to restore the <italic>AtCAD4/AtCAD5</italic> double mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eudes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), but AtCAD1 protein lacked detectable CAD catalytic activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In other experiments, a single mutation in <italic>AtCAD5</italic> showed only a slight reduction of S lignin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), only the <italic>AtCAD4/AtCAD5</italic> double mutation was necessary to reduce the S lignin unit drastically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sibout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis, however, showed that AtCAD4 could not use sinapyl aldehyde, the precursor for the S lignin unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Clearly, more in-depth investigations on CAD functions are required, particularly in relation to <italic>in planta</italic> experiments (such as transgenic plants and mutation) and <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical analysis.</p>
        <p>TaCAD1 is very similar to other <italic>bona fide</italic> CADs, in both primary amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) and three-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, a major difference was found between TaCAD1 and AtCAD5: M<sup>60</sup> and C<sup>95</sup> in the substrate binding site of AtCAD5 were replaced by A and V, respectively, in TaCAD1. Interestingly, these two substitutions are conserved in all known monocot CADs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saballos <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> suggested that these substitutions were likely to reduce substrate binding efficiency, and alter substrate specificity. According to our enzyme kinetic analyses, TaCAD1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>enz</sub>=896 000 S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) was comparable to both AtCAD5 (1 091 000 S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and AtCAD4 (74 000 S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). <italic>K</italic>m values of TaCAD1 were also close to those of AtCAD5 and AtCAD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). These data suggest that two amino acid substitutions in TaCAD1&#x2019;s substrate binding site are not likely to reduce substrate binding efficiency. But the scenario for substrate specificity was different. Both AtCAD5 and AtCAD4 used <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl aldehyde as the most preferred substrate. AtCAD5 also used sinapyl and coniferyl aldehydes, with 64% and 32% activity, respectively, of the activity of <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl aldehyde. AtCAD4 readily used coniferyl aldehyde with 43% activity of <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl aldehyde but could not use sinapyl aldehyde. It was found that TaCAD1 used coniferyl aldehyde as the most preferred substrate, and its catalytic efficiencies for sinapyl and <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl aldehydes were only 32% and 28%, respectively, of the activity of coniferyl aldehyde. Apparently, the two amino acid substitutions in the TaCAD1 may be responsible for the observed differences in substrate specificity.</p>
        <p>CAD's substrate specificity may link to the composition of lignin. The <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols are monolignols that will give rise to the <italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units, respectively, of the lignin polymer. Lignin in dicot plants is mainly composed of both G and S units. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, for example, the G, S, and H monomers in stem tissues accounted for 69.8%, 28.3%, and 1.9%, respectively, of the total lignin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In wheat stem tissues, these monomer units were approximately 52.3%, 35.1%, and 12.6%, respectively, of the total lignin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the catalytic efficiencies of TaCAD1 towards the three substrates are nearly proportional to the final monomer compositions.</p>
        <p>TaCAD1 was an enzyme whose activity is pH-dependent and temperature-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Its temperature-sensitivity is particularly intriguing when compared with TaCCR1 (wheat cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma, 2007</xref>) and TaCM (wheat caffeic acid 3-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma and Xu, 2008</xref>) in the lignin synthetic pathway of the same species. The latter enzymes did not exhibit such temperature sensitivity. It is unclear whether this is due to the binary complex required for CAD actions.</p>
        <p>TaCAD1 showed a typical random reaction mechanism; in other words, TaCAD1 protein would randomly bind its aldehyde substrates and the co-enzyme NADPH to initiate the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). This is in contrast with TaCCR2 (wheat cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 2), another NADP-dependent dehydrogenase in lignin biosynthesis, which needs to bind the co-enzyme NADPH ahead of its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma and Tian, 2005</xref>). It is worth noting that a functional CAD exists as a dimmer and its catalytic and nucleotide-binding domains are located inside a cleft formed between the two subunits of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Youn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This structural configuration could explain the random reaction mechanism of TaCAD1.</p>

        <p>TaCAD1 exhibited a unique organ-specific expression pattern. Its expression was high in stem, very low in the leaf, and undetectable in the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). This is in contrast to situations in most other monocot plants examined. For example, CAD genes from rice, sugarcane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selman-Housein <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), and ryegrass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lynch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) were expressed in both stem and root tissues, and ryegrass <italic>LpCAD3</italic> was particularly abundant in root tissues. Both sorghum <italic>SbCAD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saballos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and maize <italic>ZmCAD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) were expressed in most tissues, including leaf, stem, and root. The physiological implications of the different spatial distributions of the enzyme activities are not known. Nevertheless, it was noticed that the expression pattern of TaCAD1 was similar to TaCCR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma, 2007</xref>), another important wheat lignin gene. It would be interesting to know if these two enzymes are functional in the same physiological process, such as lodging-resistance.</p>
        <p>Results for mRNA transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>), and enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>) of TaCAD1 all pointed to a connection of this enzyme with stem lodging-resistance. H4564 (lodging-resistant) and C6001 (lodging-sensitive) are remarkably different in all these aspects at the milky stage which is the time when lodging could be devastating in the field. A high TaCAD1 gene expression would lead to enhanced lignin synthesis and, consequently, increase the strength and lodging resistance of stem tissues. This physiological role of CAD has been confirmed in maize ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) and sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sattler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) by using CAD mutants.</p>
        <p>Earlier, it was reported that gene expression and enzyme activity of TaCCR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma, 2007</xref>) and TaCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma, 2009</xref>), two other wheat lignin genes that are related to lodging-resistance, are higher in H4564 than in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. Now we know that expression of TaCAD1 is critical at the later stages. This temporal difference in gene expression coincides with the enzymes&#x2019; positions in the monolignol synthesis pathway: CCR and COMT in the early stage and CAD in the late stage of the pathway. Accumulation of lignin is the end result of well-orchestrated gene expression events. Clearly, the issue of lignin gene actions with stem lodging resistance is complex and warrants further intensive investigations.</p>
