      <abstract>
        <p>Stripe rust (or yellow rust), which is caused by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), is one of the most devastating wheat diseases worldwide. The wheat cultivar Xingzi 9104 (XZ) is an elite wheat germplasm that possesses adult plant resistance (APR), which is non&#x2013;race-specific and durable. Thus, to better understand the mechanism underlying APR, we performed transcriptome sequencing of wheat seedlings and adult plants without <italic>Pst</italic> infection, and a total of 157,689 unigenes were obtained as a reference. In total, 2,666, 783 and 2,587 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be up- or down-regulated after <italic>Pst</italic> infection at 24, 48 and 120 hours post-inoculation (hpi), respectively, based on a comparison of <italic>Pst</italic>- and mock-infected plants. Among these unigenes, the temporal pattern of the up-regulated unigenes exhibited transient expression patterns during <italic>Pst</italic> infection, as determined through a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. In addition, a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that many biological processes, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species, photosynthesis and thiamine metabolism, which mainly control the mechanisms of lignification, reactive oxygen species and sugar, respectively, are involved in APR. In particular, the continuous accumulation of reactive oxygen species may potentially contribute to the ability of the adult plant to inhibit fungal growth and development. To validate the bioinformatics results, 6 candidate genes were selected for further functional identification using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system, and 4 candidate genes likely contribute to plant resistance against <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Our study provides new information concerning the transcriptional changes that occur during the <italic>Pst</italic>-wheat interaction at the adult stage and will help further our understanding of the detailed mechanisms underlying APR to <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Stripe rust (or yellow rust), which is caused by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), is a common and damaging disease of wheat <italic>(Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) that causes significant yield and grain quality losses [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The plant innate immune response is highly diverse in its capacity to recognize and respond to biotrophs, and most plants are resistant to most plant pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Accordingly, the breeding of resistant cultivars is the most effective, economic and environmentally favorable method for controlling diseases [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Stripe rust resistance is broadly categorized as either all-stage resistance (seedling resistance) or adult plant resistance (APR) [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Because that <italic>Pst</italic> rapidly evolves new races, cultivars with seedling resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> usually become susceptible within a few years after being popularized [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, wheat cultivars with APR usually remain resistant even after being popularized in large areas for many years [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Wheat cultivar Xingzi 9104 (XZ) is susceptible to <italic>Pst</italic> at seedling stage, which possesses non-race specific to stripe rust at adult plant stage [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, its underlying protective mechanism is still unclear. Over the past several years, the rapid and inexpensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) method has resulted in high-throughput gene expression profiling, genome annotation and the discovery of non-coding RNA [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An increasing body of evidence suggests that transcriptome sequencing using NGS technology provides high-resolution data and is a powerful tool for studying global transcriptional networks. Using this technology, we can successfully obtain a large amount of sequence data that may represent the gene expression profile of wheat under a particular condition. To the best of our knowledge, the transcription profiling of the wheat cultivar XZ infected with stripe rust has not yet been reported. Considering the agricultural value of XZ, a comprehensive description of the genes expressed in XZ during infection is necessary for the discovery of candidate defense-related genes. In this study, we obtained a large number of distinct sequences (designated as unigenes) from an equal mix of total RNA from XZ at 0 hours post-inoculation (hpi) without <italic>Pst</italic> at the adult plant stage (Ak-M-0) and total RNA from XZ at 0 hpi without <italic>Pst</italic> at the seedling stage (Sk-M-0) using the Illumina NGS technology. In this manuscript, we present the current understanding of the assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences. Additionally, we provide information obtained from a digital gene expression (DGE) system that was used to compare the gene expression profiles of adult XZ plants at three infection stages, namely 24, 48 and 120 hpi with <italic>Pst</italic>. This comparison allowed us to elucidate the molecular mechanism and identify the responsive genes underlying the complex XZ resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>. These findings should facilitate the development of effective strategies for the breeding of resistant &#x201C;wheat&#x201D; varieties to obtain a better control of stripe rust.</p>

For the preparation of plant samples, germinated seeds were maintained at 4&#xB0;C for 40 days for vernalization before being planted in large 20-cm-diameter pots, which contained mellow soil. These pots, which contained five seeds, were placed in a greenhouse at 20&#xB0;C for cultivation, where they received 16 hours of light a day. Topdressing can be carried out with water during booting stage of wheat. For the inoculation, the second leaf of wheat seedling plants at the two-leaf stage and the flag leaf of wheat adult plants at the boot stage were simultaneously inoculated with fresh <italic>Pst</italic> race CYR32 with a paintbrush until whole surface became wet without run-off as described [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

These time points were selected based on microscopic studies [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All of the samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#xB0;C. The remaining plants were rated in terms of symptoms at 15 days post-inoculation (dpi).

All of the clean reads were mapped to our transcriptome reference database. Each library generated raw reads that ranged from 290 to 318 Mb, with reference genome alignments greater than 84% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s013">S1 Table</xref>). Together, each library generated clean reads that ranged from 5.78 to 6.34 million, and the proportion of the total reads exceeded 98%, which indicates that the transcriptional data were reliable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Saturation analyses of the six DGE libraries were performed to determine whether the number of detected genes continued to increase as the sequence quantity increased (total tag number). The number of detected genes almost ceased to increase at a sequence quantity of at least 600 million (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s006">S6 Fig</xref>); the coverage statistics were high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). All of these findings indicate that the sequencing data was accurate and reliable. A G-test (FDR&lt;0.001) of the RPKM-derived read counts with multiple genetic differences greater than four-fold was performed to detect the DEGs within these pairs, i.e., (Ak-I-24 vs. Ak-M-24), (Ak-I-48 vs. Ak-M-48) and (Ak-I-120 vs. Ak-M-120), and to identify genes that are responsive to <italic>Pst</italic> infection at the adult plant stage. Approximately 2,666, 786 and 2,587 DEGs were obtained at 24, 48 and 120 hpi, respectively. Additionally, 1,198, 155 and 1,645 unigenes were down-regulated and 1,468, 628 and 942 unigenes were up-regulated at 24, 48 and 120 hpi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A total of 427 unigenes were up-regulated between 24 and 48 hpi, whereas 48 unigenes were up-regulated between 48 and 120 hpi. In addition, 64 unigenes were up-regulated between 24 and 120 hpi, and 37 unigenes were up-regulated at all three sampled stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The regulated unigenes represented on the array were significantly differentially expressed at 24, 48 and 120 hpi. We used the gene cluster set to generate a tree that shows the similarities in the relative gene expressions among the three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>To investigate the plant disease-resistance of XZ during <italic>Pst</italic> infection, Fisher&#x2019;s exact test in the Blast2GO software was used to explore the statistically enriched GO terms of the up-regulated genes during <italic>Pst</italic> infection at the adult plant stage compared with the entire transcriptome background (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). The results of the up-regulated unigenes identified from the Ak-I-24 vs. Ak-M-24 comparison were as follows. In the &#x2018;cellular component&#x2019; category, proteins involved with cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicles, the chloroplastic endopeptidase Clp complex, the glyoxysome and the cell wall were highly enriched. In the &#x2018;molecular function&#x2019; category, proteins involved in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, heme binding and pyruvate and phosphate dikinase activity were highly enriched, and 78 compounds were also enriched. In the &#x2018;biological process&#x2019; category, proteins involved in the SA catabolic process, cinnamic acid biosynthetic process and L-phenylalanine catabolic process were highly enriched, and an additional 97 compounds were also enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>).

Interestingly, the KEGG pathway analysis showed that 45, 42 and 34 significantly enriched pathways were identified at the three infection stages, namely 24 hpi, 48 hpi and 120 hpi, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s011">S2 File</xref>). These up-regulated DEGs were found to be involved in many biological processes related to systemic symptom development, including thiamine metabolism, purine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, novobiocin biosynthesis and photosynthesis. An additional 15 significantly enriched pathways were identified at the three adult plant stages. Fourteen significantly enriched pathways were only identified from the Ak-I-24 vs. Ak-M-24 comparison, whereas 5 significantly enriched pathways were only identified in the Ak-I-48 vs. Ak-M-48 comparison, and 7 significantly enriched pathways were only identified from the Ak-I-120 vs. Ak-M-120 comparison.</p>

        <title>Comparison of digital gene expression values with qRT-PCR analysis results</title>
        <p>To evaluate the reliability of our RNA-Seq and DGE analysis, 30 unigenes, which presented a wide range of expression levels and patterns under <italic>Pst</italic> infection, were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. These unigenes were selected based on their homology to genes that are known to play a role in pathogenesis/defense, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, secondary metabolism or that encode hypothetical or unknown proteins. The corresponding primers were designed and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s012">S3 File</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150717.t002">Table 2</xref>, the results agreed well with the DGE patterns. In addition, the unigenes involved in pathogenesis-related proteins (wheat11332_refgene, wheat10510_refgene and wheat59172_refgene) were strongly up-regulated as early as 24 hpi and afterward presented relatively up-regulated expression. The transcripts of wheat31335_refgene and wheat12328_refgene were increased by 3.53 to 21.09 -fold, respectively. The unigenes of wheat57563_refgene, wheat12902_refgene, wheat75137_refgene, wheat75952_refgene and wheat10297_refgene, which are related to ROS burst, presented up-regulated expression at 24, 48 and 120 hpi. However, 6 unigenes with putative functions associated with thiol methyltransferase 2, ATP synthase subunit alpha, chloroplastic, protease Do-like 2, ribonuclease1 and a hypothetical protein were down-regulated as early as 24 and 48 hpi. The remaining 15 unigenes showed significantly higher expression patterns, which suggests that the selected unigenes may play an active role during the interaction between wheat and <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

        <p>Based on the GO and KEGG pathway enrichment results, we speculated that six DEGs may play a role in the APR of XZ during <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Wheat37392_refgene and wheat12902_refgene were enriched in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, whereas wheat75137_refgene and wheat31306_refgene were enriched in peroxidase activity and nitric-oxide synthase activity, and wheat36302_refgene and wheat12266_refgene were enriched in the chlorophyll biosynthetic process and the photosynthesis process. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the six candidate genes were only up-regulated at the adult plant stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and which showed that the six candidate genes were to be positive regulators of the APR at the adult plant stage. So, the candidate genes were only silenced in wheat at the adult plant stage using the Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system. The corresponding primers were designed and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s014">S2 Table</xref>. At the adult plant stage, all of the BSMV-inoculated plants displayed mild chlorotic mosaic symptoms at 13 dpi, but no obvious defects in further leaf growth were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g006">Fig 6</xref>). We tested the silencing of the wheat <italic>PDS</italic> gene to confirm whether our VIGS system functioned correctly and obtained typical photo-bleaching at 15 dpi on the flag leaves of the plants inoculated with BSMV:PDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g006">Fig 6</xref>). To calculate the silencing efficiency of VIGS, qRT-PCR assays were performed to examine the relative transcript levels of the candidate genes in the flag leaves of plants infected with CYR32. Compared with the BSMV:&#x3B3;-infected leaves, the transcript levels of candidate genes in knockdown plant were reduced from 59% to 71% at 24, 48 and 120 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g007">Fig 7</xref>). After inoculation with CYR32, hypersensitive reaction (HR) was observed in the flag leaves of the control plants (mock- and BSMV-&#x3B3;-infected) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Phenotypic changes relative to the control were observed on the flag leaves of four candidate gene-knockdown plants (wheat37392_refgene, wheat12902_refgene, wheat75137_refgene and wheat31306_refgene), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g006">Fig 6</xref>). On the contrary, no phenotypic changes were observed on the wheat36302_refgene- and wheat12266_refgene-knockdown plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Furthermore, to determine wheather candidate genesis involved in host resistance, we have assayed histological changes in VIGS-silenced plants inoculated with <italic>Pst</italic> race CYR32 isolate. At 48 and 120 hpi with <italic>Pst</italic> race CYR32, we evaluated the necrotic area, as well as the hyphal length. The histological observations showed that the average of necrotic area per infection site decreased significantly at 120 hpi in knockdown wheat plants (wheat37392_refgene, wheat12902_refgene, wheat75137_refgene and wheat31306_refgene) compared with the control plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8A</xref>); and the hyphal length increased significantly at 120 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In addition, the content of lignification and ROS decreased significantly at 120 hpi in knockdown plant (wheat12902_refgene, wheat75137_refgene and wheat31306_refgene) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8C and 8E</xref>); Wheat-37392_refgene or 12902_refgene -silenced plants showed a decrease in content of SA at 24, 48 and 120 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8D</xref>); and the content of chloroplast did not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). The VIGS assays were reproduced similarly in three independent experiments.</p>

        <title>Transcripts exhibited transient expression patterns at the adult stage of wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic></title>
        <p>In the present study, we generated a cDNA library through the Illumina sequencing of mRNA isolated from leaves of adult plants of the wheat cultivar XZ inoculated with <italic>Pst</italic> CYR32. A previous study showed that when a sequencing throughput technique generates more than 2,000,000 tags, nearly all of the genes expressed in the sample can be identified in the expression data [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, the number of clean reads from each of the eight treatments ranged from 578 to 639 million; therefore, the sequences should allow us to identify almost every gene involved in the plant response to <italic>Pst</italic> infection. For the transcriptome sequencing of seedling and adult plant samples at 0 hours post-mock-infection, 157,689 specific unigenes were identified. The transcription of genes in other species, such as Arabidopsis, maize, barley and cucumber, also accounted for a large proportion [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which illustrates the importance of transcriptional regulation during biological activities. The assigned GO terms were summarized into three main GO categories: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. Based on the Nr annotation, the Blast2GO program was used to obtain the GO annotations. Under the biological process category, cellular process (32.05%) was the largest group, followed by metabolic process (32.01%). Under the cellular component category, cell (34.02%) and cell part (34.02%) were the largest groups, whereas in the molecular function category, binding (45.07%) was the largest group, followed by catalytic activity (40.84%). These similar aforementioned results showed that normal biological activity was dependent on the regulation of biological processes, which has also been shown through the transcriptome sequencing of microorganisms, plants, animals and humans [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The DGE technique, which is based on the computational analysis of 21-bp tags derived from the 3&#x2019; ends of transcripts, has been used to generate transcriptome profiles for various species [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present study, the DGE profiles of wheat during <italic>Pst</italic> infection were based on the immediate direct application of the transcriptome data from the Sk-M-0 and Ak-M-0 samples. The sequenced tags of the six DGE libraries were then matched to 157,689 unigenes from our transcriptome reference database. Therefore, we used the gene cluster set to generate a tree that showed the similarities in the relative gene expression among the three time points. We only considered the transcript levels of unigenes that had increased or decreased by at least two-fold in each of the comparisons. The results indicated that the change in most of the unigenes was transient and that the unigenes were only altered at one time point during <italic>Pst</italic> infection. A few of the identified unigenes were long-lived, i.e., changes in their expression were sustained for two or three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This result was consistent with the findings of a study on the soybean response to Asian soybean rust controlled by the <italic>Rpp2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and of a study on the wheat response to <italic>Pst</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, it has been proposed that there is a transcriptional peak in the temporal pattern of transcript accumulation that occurs around the time of fungal penetration [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the afore-mentioned study, this peak occurred at 24 hpi, which is consistent with the timing observed in our study. The 24-hpi time point reflects the haustorial penetration by <italic>Pst</italic> at approximately 24 hpi [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After this peak, the differential expression sharply declines from 72 to 96 hpi and then increases at approximately 72&#x2013;168 hpi [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our study, we observed a decrease in expression at 48 hpi, which is consistent with the results of the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and then another increase at 120 hpi. This result indicates that the regulation response is differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The question of why the majority of the up-regulated unigenes show a one-step-up and one-step-down pattern then arises. It is possible that the marked reprogramming of the transcriptome is connected to the three phases of <italic>Pst</italic> growth, which include a penetration phase, a parasitic phase and a sporulation phase [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A GO term enrichment analysis was then applied to our data in the present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>), even though this tool has not been perfected and has limited coverage. Previous studies have suggested that upon pathogen recognition, plants activate complex signaling pathways that lead to a broad array of responses.</p>

        <title>The phenylpropanoid pathway plays an important role during the early stage of infection</title>
        <p>Germlings of <italic>Pst</italic> penetrate the host cell and form a haustorium at 24 hpi [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At 24 hpi, the over-represented GO categories among the up-regulated unigenes were related to functions such as the L-phenylalanine biosynthetic process, the cell-wall macromolecule catabolic process, the SA catabolic process and the lignin catabolic process. Furthermore, the KEGG pathway analysis showed that the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism were highly enriched at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s011">S2 File</xref>). Previous studies have identified SA, lignins, flavonoids, phytoalexins and coumarins as secondary metabolic compounds that are produced by the phenylpropanoid pathway [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The activation of this pathway has been shown to be involved in or related to plant defense [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In our data for the &#x2018;biological process&#x2019; category, proteins associated with the L-phenylalanine catabolic process, the L-phenylalanine biosynthetic process and the response to phenylalanine were highly enriched at 24 and 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). The production of these compounds relies on the conversion of phenylalanine to precursor substances by various enzymes, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], all of which were observed to be enriched at 24 or 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). Seven refgenes were enriched in the GO term L-phenylalanine biosynthetic process and were only regulated at 24 hpi according to the RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). In the present study, to further characterize the function of phenylalanine metabolism during the wheat-<italic>Pst</italic> interaction, we used a knockdown approach to determine the role of wheat37392_refgene and wheat12902_refgene, which were found to be enriched in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway at 24 hpi in the wheat-<italic>Pst</italic> interaction at the adult plant stage. The histological observations of knockdown plants were consistent with the host response experiments, and which were also in parallel with the original hypothesis. The time point of haustorium formation in the infection sites of adult plant leaves was at 24 hpi [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These histological observations suggested that lignification in plants at the adult plant stage may arrest or retard fungal penetration or haustorium formation. SA is a primary plant defense hormone that is crucial for the activation of many plant defenses, including the induction of systemic acquired resistance and the HR [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the present study, we also found that low SA level reduced the accumulation of ROS in the knockdown plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8</xref>), which was associated with HR. It has been suggested that the synthesis of SA occurs through two alternative pathways: the shikimate pathway (SP) and the isochorismate synthase-dependent pathway [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. According to the data obtained for the &#x2018;biological process&#x2019; category, proteins involved with SP, systemic acquired resistance and the SA-mediated signaling pathway were enriched at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). It was evident that the <italic>Pst</italic>-induced accumulation of SA by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which is an enzyme required for the SP-dependent pathway production of SA, was highly enriched at 24 and 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). Additionally, the pathway of isochorismate synthase-dependent was not significantly regulated. Therefore, lignifications and SA maybe play significant roles in the APR to <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Taken together, these data suggest that during the early stage of the infection, the phenylpropanoid pathway plays an important role in resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>, which hinges on the ability to induce a broad defense response at the adult plant stage.</p>

        <title>The continuous accumulation of reactive oxygen species contributed to APR to <italic>Pst</italic></title>
        <p>ROS and nitric oxide (NO) are not only important as signaling mechanisms for defense but also thought to regulate programmed cell death through the establishment of a HR [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. During the development of a pathogen on adult plants, HR is not exhibited until 36 hpi in the inoculated leaves of the adult plants, and the host cells become increasingly necrotic and begin to lose their original shape at 48 hpi [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The analysis of the data revealed that some enrichments related to the ROS or NO production systems, including peroxidase activity and nitric-oxide synthase activity, which were highly enriched at 24 hpi, were found to be involved in the defense responses of wheat to <italic>Pst</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). The &#x2018;response to ozone&#x2019; and &#x2018;response to hydrogen peroxide&#x2019; categories were highly enriched at 24and 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). It was hypothesized that the first phase of ROS generation at 24 and 48 hpi coincided with the beginning of haustorium formation and subsequent HR in infected host cells. Plants attempt to maintain a dynamic balance between ROS generation and elimination through their own defense mechanisms. The &#x2018;positive regulation of superoxide dismutase activity&#x2019; and &#x2018;hydrogen peroxide catabolic process&#x2019; categories were highly enriched at 120 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s010">S1 File</xref>). A previous study offered similar evidence that the second burst phase of ROS at 120 hpi coincides with an increasing number of necrotic host cells and the formation of secondary hyphae surrounding the infected plant cells [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this study, knockdown of wheat75137_refgene and wheat31306_refgene by VIGS decreased plant resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> associated with the low ROS accumulation, where oxidative stress is generated to create toxicity and kill pathogens at the infection unit. So, hyphal length increased and the necrotic area decreased in the knockdown plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150717.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that these two candidate genes most contribute to APR by modulating the ROS accumulation. Based on previous data and our study, it could be hypothesized that the burst of ROS at different phases coincides with the profiles of <italic>Pst</italic> development in infected plants.</p>

        <title>Photosynthesis was up-regulated during the later stage of infection</title>
        <p>When responding to <italic>Pst</italic> infection, the wheat plant activated thousands of genes in the early stage at 24 hpi, which may induce the expression of key defense-related genes at 48 and 120 hpi through a synergistic effect. This proposed hypothesis suggests that priming or core control genes must trigger other downstream or defense-related genes through a network of pathways. By 120 hpi, there is an increasing number of necrotic host cells surrounding the attacked cells; in addition, the encased haustorial body collapses and becomes necrotic, or the haustorial body cannot expand and thus becomes necrotic [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The categories obtained from the GO enrichment analysis of the up-regulated unigenes at 120 hpi were related to the chlorophyll biosynthetic process, the photosystem II assembly process and photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I, photosynthesis, light harvesting and the chloroplast relocation process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). In our study, we found that the unigenes involved in the glyoxylate cycle process were clearly induced at 24 hpi. In terms of primary metabolism, the metabolism of certain amino acids was also clearly altered. Several earlier studies have shown that plants appear to switch off photosynthesis locally during the early stages of the defense reaction [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The data obtained in this study detected no enrichments of photosynthesis at 24 and 48 hpi, which is consistent with the results of the aforementioned previous studies. This decrease was due not only to the elimination of the green (photosynthetic) leaf area as a consequence of the HR but also to an alteration in the host metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Photosynthesis has been reported to modulate plant defense responses induced by pathogen infection [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Interestingly, the photosystem II assembly process, the photosynthetic electron transport in the photosystem I process, photosynthesis, the light harvesting process and the chlorophyll biosynthetic process were enriched at 120 hpi. Surprisingly, knockdown of candidate genes (wheat36302_refgene, wheat12266_refgene) via VIGS system showed no differences compared with the control plant. There may be two main reasons why experiments failed. First, the candidate genes were only knockdown, not knockout, the silencing efficiency of the candidate genes were 61% - 76% at each time point. And second, sequence alignment with the T. <italic>aestivum</italic> cv. Chinese Spring genome sequence showed that there were three and four copies in the wheat genome, respectively. The starch and sucrose metabolism pathway, which is related to the carbohydrate metabolism process, was identified at 120 hpi. This proposed hypothesis is consistent with previous results: a plant&#x2019;s susceptibility to certain diseases relatively depends on the sugar levels in the leaf tissues [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that the photosynthesis in the adult XZ plant is associated with the enhanced resistance of wheat to <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

        <title>Thiamine metabolism was potentially linked to adult plant resistance to <italic>Pst</italic></title>
        <p>The thiamine metabolism pathway was the most enriched KEGG pathway during successive symptom phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s011">S2 File</xref>). Plants contain a wide range of vitamins that are essential not only for human metabolism but also for plants because of their redox chemistry and role as enzymatic cofactors in plant major metabolic pathways, including the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, acetyl-CoA synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the Calvin cycle, plant pigment biosynthesis, anaerobic ethanolic fermentation and the branched-chain amino acid pathway [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In a recent study, thiamine was shown to alleviate the effects of several environmental stresses on <italic>Zea mays</italic> seedlings and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, presumably by protecting the plant from oxidative damage. Hence, it has been suggested that thiamine plays an indirect role as an antioxidant in plants by providing NADH and NADPH to combat oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Other reported phenomena suggest that thiamine compounds may play an important role in the induction of systemic acquired resistance by activating pathogenesis-related genes in plant species against some fungal and bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150717.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Thiamine is one of the products of the purine biosynthetic pathway [<xref rid="pone.0150717.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], which was also found to be enriched through the KEGG pathway analysis during the infection stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150717.s011">S2 File</xref>). We also speculate that the thiamine metabolism and purine biosynthesis pathways are involved in the APR to <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>APR is agriculturally valuable because of its non-race specificity and durability; thus, understanding its resistance mechanism is important. In the present study, our work was carefully designed to capture the transcript response that occurs in XZ through the selection of sampling time points based on a quantitative estimation of <italic>Pst</italic> development. Therefore, the data obtained in this study were generated by transcriptome sequencing and digital expression profiling. It has been suggested that the change in most unigenesis is transient and that unigenes are only altered at one time point during <italic>Pst</italic> infection. In addition, we revealed that the development of <italic>Pst</italic> was markedly inhibited in adult plants at different infection stages by many biological processes, such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species, photosynthesis, and the thiamine metabolism pathway. Therefore, this study provides a tool for elucidating the mechanisms of APR that can be used in broader APR research.</p>
