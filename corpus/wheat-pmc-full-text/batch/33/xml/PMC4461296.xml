        <p>Group A protein phosphatases 2Cs (PP2Cs) are essential components of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis; however, the function of group F2 subfamily PP2Cs is currently less known. In this study, TaPP2C1 which belongs to group F2 was isolated and characterized from wheat. Expression of the TaPP2C1-GFP fusion protein suggested its ubiquitous localization within a cell. <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> expression was downregulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and NaCl treatments, but upregulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Overexpression of <italic>TaPP2C1 </italic>in tobacco resulted in reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt resistance of transgenic seedlings. Additionally, physiological analyses showed that improved resistance to salt stress conferred by <italic>TaPP2C1 </italic>is due to the reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, the improved antioxidant system, and the increased transcription of genes in the ABA-independent pathway. Finally, transgenic tobacco showed increased resistance to oxidative stress by maintaining a more effective antioxidant system. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TaPP2C1 negatively regulates ABA signaling, but positively regulates salt resistance. TaPP2C1 confers salt resistance through activating the antioxidant system and ABA-independent gene transcription process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling plays critical roles in regulating plants&#x2019; responses to abiotic stress. When abiotic stress occurs, content of ABA dramatically increases in plant and promotes stomatal closure, antioxidative system, growth, and development, protecting vegetative tissues from injury [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some studies have begun to clarify the ABA signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several important components of ABA signaling, including ABA receptors PYR/PYL/RCARs, negative regulators PP2Cs, and positive regulators SnRK2s have been characterized in Arabidopsis. These components constitute a double negative modulatory model. PP2C inhibits SnRK2 through its direct dephosphorylation in the absence of ABA. In response to developmental or environmental clues, ABA signal induces the interaction between PYR/PYL/RCAR and PP2C, leading to PP2C inhibition and SnRK2 activation.</p>
      <p>Protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs), a group of monomeric protein phosphatases, are found in humans, yeast, and plants [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To date, genome wide analyses have found 80 and 78 <italic>PP2Cs</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> respectively. PP2Cs in Arabidopsis and rice have been further classified into 13 and 11 groups respectively, according to phylogenic analyses, gene structures, and protein motifs [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Accumulated evidence has confirmed that group A PP2Cs play negative roles in ABA signaling, of which some crucial members have been characterized, including AHG1, HAB1, HAB2, ABI1, ABI2 and PP2CA in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These PP2Cs play both independent and overlapping roles in ABA signaling because double and triple mutants exhibit enhanced ABA sensitivity for stomatal movement, seed germination or gene transcription [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The exact roles of some group A PP2Cs in ABA signaling transduction were clarified by detailed genetic and biochemical analyses. PYR/PYL/RCAR can interact with ABI1, ABI2, HAB1, and AHG3 in the absence of ABA, which inhibits PP2C activity and activates downstream targets, such as SnRK2 and other PP2C substrates. This results in phosphorylation or activation of bZIP transcription factors ABF/AREB/ABI5, Slow Anion Channel SLAC1, and other ABA-responsive genes [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ABA-induced PYL-PP2C interaction model in ABA signaling was further supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> protoplasts [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Due to the prominent role of ABA signaling in the abiotic stress response, some studies have also confirmed the function of PP2Cs in ABA-mediated abiotic stress resistance. For example, <italic>AtPP2CA</italic> was induced by ABA and abiotic stress, and transgenic antisense lines displayed improved resistance to freezing stress and increased sensitivity to ABA [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The interaction between ABI2 and salt overly sensitive 2 (SOS2) was destroyed by <italic>abi2-1</italic> mutation, which caused an improved salt stress resistance and ABA insensitivity in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These results suggest that group A PP2C, PP2CA, and ABI2 are negative regulators of plant resistance to freezing, salt, and ABA signaling; however, overexpression of a group G <italic>PP2C</italic> gene, <italic>AtPP2CG1</italic>, increased salt resistance of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. The expression levels of <italic>AtPP2CG1</italic> in the <italic>abi2-3</italic> were lower relative to wild type (WT) plants under salt treatment. These results demonstrate that <italic>AtPP2CG1</italic> positively modulate salt stress response with ABA-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which suggests that, besides group A PP2Cs, other subfamilies of PP2Cs may participate in abiotic stress response and ABA signaling. Additionally, microarray analyses have identified 47 PP2Cs genes across all the 13 subgroups that respond to ABA and abiotic stress at transcriptional levels in <italic>A</italic>.<italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there is less evidence of PP2Cs function in other subfamilies involved in ABA signaling and abiotic stress, especially for the group F2 PP2Cs.</p>
      <p>Soil salinity severely limits growth and development of plants and leads to significant loss of crop yield [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, investigation of mechanisms underlying the abiotic stress response is necessary to improve stress resistance in wheat. In this study, we characterized the function of the first wheat <italic>PP2C</italic> gene <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> (a group F2 subfamily PP2C), which confers resistance to salt stress by inducing the antioxidant system and ABA-independent gene expression system.</p>

        <title>ABA response and stress resistance analysis of transgenic lines</title>
        <p>For ABA sensitivity assay, tobacco seeds were sown on MS or MS with 0.5 or 1 &#x3BC;M ABA for 12 days, and then the germination rates were calculated. In addition, 7 d old seedlings were transferred to MS or MS with 0.5 or 1&#x3BC;M ABA for 7 d, then the root length was measured, and then the ABA (1 &#x3BC;M) treated and control seedlings were collected to determine transcriptional levels of ABA associated genes. For salt stress resistance assay during germination, seeds from transgenic tobacco lines and control plants were sown on MS or MS with 200 mM NaCl for 8 d to test the germination rate. For salt resistance analysis in early seedlings, 7 d old tobacco seedlings from wild type (WT), vector control (VC) and transgenic plants were placed on MS or MS containing 100&#x2013;200 mM NaCl for 7 d, then the root length was measured, and then the NaCl (200 mM) treated and control seedlings were sampled to test the transcriptional levels of ABA- and stress- associated genes. For salt stress resistance assay in adult seedlings, 21 d old seedlings were treated with 300 mM NaCl stress for 40 d, and then the survival rates were calculated. After 20 or 35 d of salt stress, the leaf samples were collected to determine the content of ion leakage (IL), Malondialdehyde (MDA), and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes. Additionally, 42 d old seedlings were applied with 300 mM NaCl solution for 90 d, and then the photographs were taken. For oxidative stress resistance analysis, 7 d old seedlings were cultured on MS containing 30 &#x3BC;M methyl viologen (MV) for 10 d, and then the photos were taken. The whole seedlings were sampled to examine H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content, activities and transcripts of SOD and CAT. Besides, 7 d old seedlings were incubated on MS with 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 14 d, and then the photos were taken.</p>

        <p>In order to examine whether <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> is involved in the ABA signaling, seed germination and primary root length were examined after ABA treatment. The seeds from controls and transgenic plants were directly sown on MS or ABA-containing MS medium for testing seed germination. Transgenic seeds showed similar germination rates to controls under normal condition (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>); however, control seeds had reduced germination rate after ABA treatment compared to the transgenic lines (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

There were no differences for root growth between controls and transgenic plants under normal growth condition (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Although the exogenous application of ABA (0.5 or 1 &#x3BC;M) inhibited the growth of primary roots in both controls and transgenic lines, the stronger inhibition of root length was observed in control plants compared with transgenic plants (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Over the last few decades, research has been focused on clarifying the ABA signaling pathway, among which, group A PP2Cs have been characterized as crucial negative regulators of ABA signaling. However, the role of PP2Cs of other subfamilies remained less known, especially for the group F2 PP2Cs. Genome-wide analyses have identified five genes of group F2 <italic>PP2C</italic> responding to ABA and abiotic stress at transcriptional level in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to study whether group F2 <italic>PP2C</italic> genes participate in the regulation of ABA signaling and abiotic stress resistance, and whether group F2 <italic>PP2C</italic> genes conferring resistance to abiotic stress is related to ABA signaling. In this study, we characterized the roles of <italic>TaPP2C1</italic>, a group F2 <italic>PP2C</italic> gene, in ABA signaling and salt stress and found: (i) the relationship between <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> and ABA signaling; (ii) the function and physiological mechanism of <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> under salt stress; and (iii) the relationship between <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> function in salt stress and ABA.</p>

        <title><italic>TaPP2C1</italic> acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling</title>
        <p>In previous studies, PP2C and protein phosphorylation events have been characterized to play crucial roles in ABA signaling pathway in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> through identifying the two ABA-insensitive loci ABI1 and ABI2 [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This concept was further confirmed by evidences demonstrating that double or triple mutants of PP2Cs have increased sensitivity to ABA [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The negative regulatory roles of PP2Cs in ABA signaling were also verified in other plant species [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
        <p>In the present study, the transcriptional response of <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> to ABA was investigated in wheat, and it was found that that <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> expression is down-regulated by ABA treatment (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>TaPP2C1-</italic>overexpressing tobacco plants displayed ABA insensitivity during seed germination and root elongation (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The expression of ABA biosynthesis (<italic>NtNCED1</italic>), ABA signaling transduction (<italic>NtAREB</italic>), and ABA responsive (<italic>TobLTP1</italic>) genes showed lower levels in transgenic plants than in WT with the application of ABA (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> overexpression reduced the transcripts of <italic>NtNCED1</italic> and <italic>NtAREB</italic> under salt stress, indicating that the ABA signaling pathway may be inhibited under salt stress in transgenic plants (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). These results allowed us to conclude that <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> is a negative regulator of ABA signaling.</p>

        <title><italic>TaPP2C1</italic> confers salt stress resistance by activating the antioxidant system</title>
        <p>PP2Cs have been confirmed to play crucial roles in plants responding to abiotic and biotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Some PP2Cs, such as PP2CA and ABI2, were reported to negatively regulate plant resistance to freezing and salt stresses [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas AtPP2CG1 and ZmPP2C2 have been shown to be positive regulators of salt and cold stress resistance [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> overexpression enhanced salt stress resistance in 7 d, 14 d, and 42 d old tobacco seedlings (Figs <xref rid="pone.0129589.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129589.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>); thus, TaPP2C1 is a positive regulator of salt stress resistance.</p>
        <p>As the damaging effects of saline affects various biological processes, such as growth, photosynthesis and metabolism, plants have evolved a series of signaling pathways to relieve the damage of salt stress, including not only ABA signaling but also other plant hormones and signaling molecules. In particular, SA, ethylene, and jasmonic acid have been shown to affect abiotic stress responses through a complex interaction with ABA [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, PP2Cs can not be modulated by regulatory subunits due to their characteristic of monomeric enzyme. The interactions of substrates or signaling components with PP2Cs are required for PP2Cs obtaining specific function. Thus, PP2C activity might also be affected by protein synthesis, sequestering, or second messengers that include Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and unsaturated fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, TaPP2C1 may be regulated by ABA, as well as by other multiple signaling molecules supported by the expression patterns of <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> in response to different signaling molecules (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129589.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The obvious induction of <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment implies a relationship between the improved resistance to salt stress conferred by <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <p>On the basis of physiological analysis, the improved resistance to salt stress in transgenic plants is associated with the maintenance of less IL and MDA content which are important indicators of membrane injury (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). MDA, the product of lipid peroxidation, is usually used for evaluating ROS-mediated damage in plants [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. TaPP2C1 overexpression may have been resulted in relieving lipid peroxidation caused by ROS injury under salt treatment. Therefore, there is a need to investigate whether <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> plays a role in ROS scavenging.</p>
        <p>The transgenic lines contained lower level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> relative to WT under salt stress, implying that scavenging systems of ROS in transgenic plants might be more efficient compared to WT plants (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT, SOD and POD play crucial roles in scavenging ROS and protecting the plants from injury caused by abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Antioxidant enzymes analysis showed that the transgenic plants had obviously higher CAT and SOD activities than WT under salt treatment (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Additionally, the higher transcripts of <italic>NtSOD</italic> and <italic>NtCAT</italic> in transgenic plants relative to WT could contribute to the increased activities of NtSOD and NtCAT (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). These findings suggest that overexpression of the <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> gene improved the antioxidant defense system, and hence protecting transgenic plants from ROS-mediated damage under salt treatment.</p>
        <p>To confirm this result, the direct oxidative stress caused by MV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was applied to tobacco plants. The transgenic lines were more tolerant to oxidative stress and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and improved antioxidant system than control plants (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). The function of PP2C in enhancing cold stress resistance by improving the antioxidative system was identified previously. The <italic>ZmPP2C2</italic>-overexpressing tobacco plants exhibited higher germination rate and activities of SOD, POD and CAT, but lower IL and MDA under cold stress [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we provide evidences that <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> confers resistance to salt stress by enhancing activities and expression of SOD and CAT and hence scavenging ROS <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title><italic>TaPP2C1</italic> confers salt stress resistance by inducing transcription of ABA-independent genes</title>
        <p>Plants respond to salt stress through the perception and transduction of stress signals, which leads to induction of various stress-responsive genes that is largely regulated by specific transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Activity of transcription factor can be modulated through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which results in changes in gene expression and cell behavior [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To combat with variable environmental stresses, various transcription factors are involved in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signal transduction pathways [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. ABA-dependent and ABA-independent gene expression systems induced by salt stress mainly include AREB and DREB transcription factors, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
        <p>In the present study, <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> overexpression decreased the transcripts of ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling transduction genes, but enhanced DREB transcription factor and LEA class genes expression under salt stress (<xref rid="pone.0129589.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). DREB transcription factors were characterized to regulate a series of target genes, including LEA class proteins [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. LEA proteins function in stabilizing labile enzymes, binding water and protecting macromolecular structures under abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129589.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. <italic>NtERD10 (C/D)</italic> and <italic>NtLEA5</italic> encode group 2 and group 5 LEA proteins, respectively. The induction of these <italic>LEA</italic> genes by <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> overexpression indicate that more LEA proteins might be synthesized in transgenic plants, resulting in less membrane injury and lipid peroxidation, hence reducing the destruction of transgenic plants. Therefore, <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> confers salt stress resistance by activating the ABA-independent signaling pathway.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a group F2 <italic>PP2C</italic> gene (<italic>TaPP2C1</italic>) acts as a negative factor of ABA signaling, but as a positive factor of salt stress. <italic>TaPP2C1</italic> confers resistance to salt stress by improving the antioxidant system and ABA-independent gene expression systems. This evidence provides the impetus for further investigation of the exact roles that PP2Cs play in the ABA-independent pathway.</p>
