      <abstract>
        <p>The wheat pathogen <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> produces multiple necrotrophic effectors (also called host-selective toxins) that promote disease by interacting with corresponding host sensitivity gene products. SnTox1 was the first necrotrophic effector identified in <italic>S. nodorum</italic>, and was shown to induce necrosis on wheat lines carrying <italic>Snn1</italic>. Here, we report the molecular cloning and validation of <italic>SnTox1</italic> as well as the preliminary characterization of the mechanism underlying the SnTox1-<italic>Snn1</italic> interaction which leads to susceptibility. <italic>SnTox1</italic> was identified using bioinformatics tools and verified by heterologous expression in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>. <italic>SnTox1</italic> encodes a 117 amino acid protein with the first 17 amino acids predicted as a signal peptide, and strikingly, the mature protein contains 16 cysteine residues, a common feature for some avirulence effectors. The transformation of <italic>SnTox1</italic> into an avirulent <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate was sufficient to make the strain pathogenic. Additionally, the deletion of <italic>SnTox1</italic> in virulent isolates rendered the <italic>SnTox1</italic> mutated strains avirulent on the <italic>Snn1</italic> differential wheat line. <italic>SnTox1</italic> was present in 85% of a global collection of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates. We identified a total of 11 protein isoforms and found evidence for strong diversifying selection operating on <italic>SnTox1</italic>. The SnTox1-<italic>Snn1</italic> interaction results in an oxidative burst, DNA laddering, and pathogenesis related (PR) gene expression, all hallmarks of a defense response. In the absence of light, the development of SnTox1-induced necrosis and disease symptoms were completely blocked. By comparing the infection processes of a GFP-tagged avirulent isolate and the same isolate transformed with <italic>SnTox1</italic>, we conclude that SnTox1 may play a critical role during fungal penetration. This research further demonstrates that necrotrophic fungal pathogens utilize small effector proteins to exploit plant resistance pathways for their colonization, which provides important insights into the molecular basis of the wheat-<italic>S. nodorum</italic> interaction, an emerging model for necrotrophic pathosystems.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In this manuscript we describe the cloning of <italic>SnTox1</italic> from <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic>, the gene encoding the first host selective toxin (SnTox1) identified in this fungus. SnTox1 induces necrosis and promotes disease on wheat lines harboring the <italic>Snn1</italic> gene. We verified the function of the SnTox1 gene by expressing it in a yeast culture where the resulting culture filtrate induced necrosis but only on wheat lines that carried a functional <italic>Snn1</italic>. The <italic>SnTox1</italic> gene was also transformed into an avirulent <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate, resulting in an isolate that was virulent on wheat lines harboring <italic>Snn1</italic>. <italic>SnTox1</italic> was also disrupted in virulent <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolates resulting in the elimination of disease on <italic>Snn1</italic> differential wheat lines. Additionally, we investigated the host response to SnTox1 and <italic>S. nodorum</italic> strains producing SnTox1 and discovered that several hallmarks of a resistance response were present during the susceptible reaction, showing that the necrotrophic pathogen <italic>S. nodorum</italic> is likely using SnTox1 to stimulate a host resistance pathway involving <italic>Snn1</italic> to induce disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Like other parasites, fungal pathogens secrete a battery of molecules known as effectors during the infection process. These effectors can alter plant biological processes resulting in successful colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Kamoun1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-deWit1">[2]</xref>. Conversely, recognition of effectors by the plant innate immune system can initiate a defense response resulting in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Chisholm1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Jones1">[4]</xref>. ETI is characterized by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), transcriptional induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and production of antimicrobial chemical compounds, eventually leading to rapid and localized plant cell death, known as the hypersensitive response (HR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Dodds1">[5]</xref>. In ETI, the perception of the fungal effector is mediated by the corresponding plant resistance gene (R) which acts in a gene-for-gene manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Flor1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Keen1">[7]</xref>. Currently, it is believed that this localized suicide of plant cells induced by ETI halts further growth of the biotrophic fungal pathogen, which requires living plant tissue for survival.</p>
      <p>Necrotrophic fungal pathogens are known to produce host selective toxins (HSTs), including low molecular weight metabolites and small secreted proteins that function as essential determinants of pathogenicity or virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Scheffer1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Wolpert1">[9]</xref>. HSTs can therefore be viewed as effectors of necrotrophic pathogenicity and hence we prefer the term necrotrophic effector (NE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Oliver1">[11]</xref>. These effectors play significant roles in determining the outcomes of plant-pathogen interactions by specifically interacting (directly or indirectly) with the products of corresponding host genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen3">[13]</xref>. However, in contrast to ETI in the classical gene-for-gene model, the necrosis induced by effectors from necrotrophic fungal pathogens results in disease susceptibility; thus, it can be described as effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Faris1">[15]</xref>, a term which was originally used in reference to biotrophic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Jones1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The molecular basis of necrosis-induced ETS involving necrotrophic fungi is still largely unknown, but has in several cases exhibited the hallmarks of programmed cell death (PCD); DNA laddering, heterochromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, callose deposition and an oxidative burst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Wolpert1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Dickman1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Rudd1">[17]</xref>. ToxA, a necrotrophic effector found in both <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> and <italic>Stagonospora nodorum,</italic> causes the loss of plasma membrane integrity and the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Kwon1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Manning1">[19]</xref>. Microarray analysis revealed that several wheat genes involved in defense response and signaling pathways were strongly regulated by the ToxA-<italic>Tsn1</italic> interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Adhikari1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Pandelova1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, three plant genes involved in susceptibility to necrotrophic effectors (<italic>Pc</italic>, the sorghum sensitivity gene corresponding to PC toxin; <italic>LOV1</italic>, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sensitivity gene corresponding to victorin; and <italic>Tsn1</italic>, the wheat sensitivity gene corresponding to ToxA) have been cloned and shown to be resistance-like genes containing both nucleotide binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Faris1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Lorang1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Nagy1">[23]</xref>. This has led to speculation that necrotrophic fungal pathogens may utilize plant resistance signaling pathways to subvert PCD and enable pathogen growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Faris1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-HammondKosack1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic>, an ascomycete fungus (teleomorph: <italic>Phaeosphaeria nodorum</italic>), is the causal agent of wheat Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), a globally distributed and economically important disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Solomon1">[25]</xref>. <italic>S. nodorum</italic> is a typical necrotrophic fungal pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Solomon2">[26]</xref>. In recent years, it has been shown that this pathosystem is based largely on interactions involving proteinaceous necrotrophic effectors and corresponding host sensitivity genes that, when occurring together, result in ETS. To date, six interactions have been reported including SnTox1-<italic>Snn1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu2">[27]</xref>, SnToxA-<italic>Tsn1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu3">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen4">[29]</xref>, SnTox2-<italic>Snn2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen2">[12]</xref>, SnTox3-<italic>Snn3-B1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen5">[30]</xref>, SnTox4-<italic>Snn4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Abeysekara1">[31]</xref>, and SnTox3-<italic>Snn3-D1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Zhang1">[32]</xref>. In addition, several other effector-host gene interactions have been identified (Friesen and Faris, Oliver and Tan, unpublished data).

A specific set of criteria was used to prioritize the genes and generate a list of candidates. The criteria (size less than 30 kDa, predicted to be secreted, expressed in planta, etc, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were based on the characteristics of the previously cloned <italic>SnToxA</italic> and <italic>SnTox3</italic> genes. We focused on the top 100 genes and as expected, <italic>SnTox3</italic> and <italic>SnToxA</italic> were identified among them. PCR analysis was conducted to confirm the absence of genes in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> avirulent isolate Sn79-1087 (data not shown). Genes meeting these criteria were expressed in the <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> heterologous expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu1">[14]</xref>. This process and the subsequent screening of a set of differential lines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) led us to identify <italic>SNOG_20078</italic> as the SnTox1-encoding gene.</p>
        <p>Culture filtrates of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> strain X33 transformed with the coding region of <italic>SNOG_20078</italic> cDNA were infiltrated into the leaves of W-7984, Chinese Spring (CS), CS 1BS-18 and CS ems237. W-7984 and CS carry the dominant <italic>Snn1</italic> allele that confers sensitivity to SnTox1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu2">[27]</xref>. CS 1BS-18 and CS ems237 are nearly identical to CS, but harbor mutations at the <italic>Snn1</italic> locus, resulting in insensitivity to SnTox1.

To map the gene conferring sensitivity, the same culture filtrates were subsequently infiltrated into the entire ITMI mapping population, which segregates for <italic>Snn1</italic>/<italic>snn1</italic>. All lines sensitive to the partially purified native SnTox1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu2">[27]</xref> were also sensitive to the culture filtrates of the <italic>SNOG_20078</italic> transformed yeast strain.

        <p>The SnTox1 protein consists of 117 amino acids with the first 17 amino acids predicted as a signal peptide. Interestingly, 16 of the remaining 100 amino acids are cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002467-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). No prosequence was predicted using the web-based program ProP 1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProP/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProP/</ext-link>) and after the cleavage of the predicted signal sequence the mature protein was estimated to be 10.33 kDa. To demonstrate that SnTox1 was produced in yeast culture and to verify the size of SnTox1, we applied western blot analysis to the protein samples prepared from SnTox1 yeast culture filtrates. The antibody for SnTox1 was generated from rabbit immunized with a BSA-conjugated 14 amino acid long SnTox1 peptide (see Material and Methods). A single band was only observed in protein samples prepared from SnTox1 yeast culture filtrates, but not from the control culture filtrates (yeast strain transformed with an empty vector). Furthermore, the western band was visualized between the size standard of 10 and 15 kDa, but much closer to 10 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002467.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The estimated size of SnTox1 obtained from the western blot agreed with the predicted molecular weight of 10.33 kDa for the mature protein.</p>

Only <italic>SNOG_07154</italic> located directly upstream of <italic>SnTox1</italic> could not be amplified from the avirulent isolate Sn79-1087 (data not shown), which suggested that a region containing all or part of <italic>SNOG_07154</italic> as well as the entire <italic>SnTox1</italic> sequence may be missing in Sn79-1087. PCR primers were designed within the two genes <italic>SNOG_07153</italic> and <italic>SNOG_07155</italic> and used to amplify DNA from different virulent isolates as well as Sn79-1087.

A control without DAB staining was also conducted on CS leaves infiltrated with SnTox1 yeast culture.

        <p>Up-regulation of plant defense or signaling pathway genes including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes are hallmarks of a resistance response. Using RT-PCR, we examined the transcription level of 28 wheat genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002467.s009">Table S3</xref>) in CS (<italic>Snn1</italic>) and CS ems237 (<italic>snn1</italic>) leaves that were collected at different time points from 1 h to 72 h after being infiltrated with SnTox1 culture filtrates as well as control culture filtrates. Three genes including PR-1-A1, a thaumatin-like protein gene, and a chitinase were found to be significantly up-regulated in CS leaves infiltrated with SnTox1 compared to the control leaf samples infiltrated with culture filtrates deficient in SnTox1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002467-g010">Figure 10A</xref>).

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis confirmed the higher expression of the three genes in SnTox1 infiltrated CS leaves compared to the control infiltrated CS leaves. Not only did all three genes show maximum expression at 36 HPI, but each had at least two-fold higher expression in SnTox1-infiltrated samples than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002467-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). qPCR also showed much lower expression of the three genes in the CS ems237 line infiltrated with either SnTox1 or the control yeast culture filtrates in comparison to CS infiltrated with control culture filtrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002467-g010">Figure 10B</xref>).

        <title>Molecular cloning of <italic>SnTox1</italic></title>
        <p>The necrotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>S. nodorum</italic> produces multiple necrotrophic effectors (host-selective toxins) that function as virulence factors during the infection process. The cloning of these necrotrophic effector genes is an essential step in the characterization and elucidation of the molecular and biochemical mechanism of fungal pathogenesis in the wheat-<italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> pathosystem. Besides the traditional biochemical and genetic tools, new genomic strategies have been recently applied for the identification and cloning of effector genes in a number of fungi and oomycetes as more genome and other sequence data becomes available. A typical procedure would include a process of data mining to identify candidate genes that meet a set of specific criteria followed by gene validation through functional analysis. High throughput functional genomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Kamoun1">[1]</xref> as well as comparative genomics and association genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Yoshida1">[41]</xref> have been successfully used for the identification of pathogen effector genes in fungi and oomycetes. In the current study, we used a set of criteria to mine the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> genome sequence dataset for the identification of necrotrophic effector genes. This strategy led to the successful identification of <italic>SnTox1</italic> from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic>. Through heterologous expression, gene transformation, and gene disruption, we have provided convincing evidence that the candidate gene <italic>SNOG20078</italic> (Gene ID: 5974395) is the SnTox1-encoding gene. This research further highlights the value of genome sequence data along with efficient bioinformatics tools in identifying effector genes. We are continuing to use this strategy to identify additional <italic>S. nodorum</italic> necrotrophic effector genes.</p>

Possible differences in activity between different protein variants of SnTox1 are currently being tested.</p>

Results presented here on the SnTox1-Snn1 interaction provide further evidence that the necrotrophic wheat-<italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> system is largely based on specific host-effector interactions that act in ETS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Faris1">[15]</xref>, which essentially has the opposite outcome of ETI that operates in many biotrophic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Chisholm1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Jones1">[4]</xref>.</p>
        <p>One of the most striking features of the SnTox1 protein as a necrotrophic effector is the high cysteine residue content. This feature is often associated with fungal avirulence gene products such as the Avr and ECP effectors from <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Stergiopoulos2">[64]</xref>, SIX (secreted in xylem) effectors from <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Rep1">[55]</xref>, and Nip1 from <italic>Rhynchosporium secalis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Rohe1">[67]</xref>. The predicted mature SnTox1 protein has 100 amino acids, 16 of which are cysteine residues, the richest of all effectors that have been identified. The high content of cysteine residues and high stability suggest that SnTox1 may function in the plant apoplastic space which is abundant in plant defense components. We are currently investigating the subcellular location of SnTox1. Most small cysteine-rich secreted effectors from the tomato fungal pathogen <italic>C</italic>. <italic>fulvum</italic> such as Avr2, Avr4, Avr9, and ECP2 are thought to function exclusively in the apoplast to inhibit and protect against plant hydrolytic enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Stergiopoulos2">[64]</xref>. ECP6, another <italic>C</italic>. <italic>fulvum</italic> effector containing LysM chitin binding domains was recently found functioning apoplastically as a scavenger of fungal chitin to prevent it from eliciting PAMP-triggered immunity <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-deJonge1">[68]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed that SnTox1 has some similarity to <italic>C. fulvum</italic> Avr4 within the chitin-binding domain and in the positions of six of the cysteine residues at the C-terminus. However, further tests are needed to determine the binding activity and functional roles of the putative CB domain in SnTox1.

        <title>The SnTox1-<italic>Snn1</italic> interaction enables direct penetration</title>
        <p>Successful penetration is a prerequisite for a pathogen to establish itself and fulfill its colonization <italic>in planta</italic>. For <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic>, previous studies have observed direct penetration through the junction of epidermal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Baker1">[69]</xref> or penetration through stomata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-OReilly1">[70]</xref> or both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Solomon2">[26]</xref>. Based on our observation using GFP-tagging and confocal fluorescent microscopy, the fungus predominantly used direct penetration through the junction of epidermal cells, and stomatal entry was not evident. We have observed that the fungal mycelium grew over guard cells and anchored the penetration point between the junction of the guard cell and the adjacent epidermal cell instead of going through the stomata (data not shown). Although the avirulent isolate belongs to <italic>S. nodorum</italic>, the preference for direct penetration, which is different from that reported by Solomon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Solomon2">[26]</xref>, may be due to its adaptation to wild grasses from which it was originally isolated.</p>
        <p>It was our observation that the fungus could initiate direct penetration by producing a hyphopodia in both the resistant and the susceptible interaction with little difference, which agrees with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Baker1">[69]</xref> indicating that SnTox1 is not required for hyphopodia formation and the initial degradation of the cuticle layer and the cell wall between the junctions of the epidermal cells. Hydrolytic enzymes or other mechanisms may be employed by the fungus to breach the initial physical barrier. Several cell wall-degrading enzymes such as amylase, pectin methyl esterase, polygalacturonases, xylanases, and cellulase have been found to be produced <italic>in vitro</italic> and during the infection of wheat leaves by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Cunfer1">[71]</xref>. As infection progressed, the pathogen was unable to penetrate through the epidermal cell layer and therefore could not reach the mesophyll cells to establish a successful infection without the SnTox1-<italic>Snn1</italic> interaction. This suggests that SnTox1 is significant in the initial penetration process across the epidermal cell layer. Our hypothesis is that SnTox1 interacts with <italic>Snn1</italic> to induce cell death in epidermal cells, providing the fungus with nutrients for further invasive growth. In <italic>Cochliobolus victoria</italic> on oat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> systems, it was also observed that fungal penetration ceases following appressorium development and hyphae remain on the leaf surface in the absence of a compatible interaction, which requires both victorin and its corresponding sensitivity gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Lorang1">[22]</xref>. Our speculation was further supported by the fact that the inoculation of an <italic>Snn1</italic> line (CS) with <italic>SnTox1</italic> transformed avirulent isolates induced widespread necrosis - presumably programmed cell death - on leaves. Furthermore, inoculation with the <italic>SnTox1</italic>-knock out virulent strain lost the ability to cause this necrotic reaction. Additionally, qPCR revealed that <italic>SnTox1</italic> expression was induced <italic>in planta</italic> starting as early as 12 HPI and increased at an accelerated rate from 12 to 24 HPI when the fungus was observed to penetrate. Collectively, this suggests that <italic>S. nodorum</italic> may use SnTox1 to induce cell death in the epidermal cells, providing a portal to enter the plant and subsequently feeding from dead cells to gain nutrients for further invasive growth.</p>

        <title>SnTox1 induces a light dependent reaction</title>
        <p>It is well known that plant defenses against pests and pathogens are commonly influenced by environmental conditions, including light. Many studies have demonstrated the requirement of illumination for the interaction of plants with a diversity of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the isolated pathogenic elicitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Roberts1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-ChandraShekara1">[73]</xref>. The effect of light on the disease development of SNB was first noticed by Baker and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Baker1">[69]</xref> who observed that the necrotic reaction and lesion coalescence tended to be suppressed in the absence of light. The necrotrophic effector ToxA, was also shown to induce light-dependent necrosis on <italic>Tsn1</italic> lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Manning3">[37]</xref>. Among the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> necrotrophic effectors published to date, all effectors except SnTox3 have been shown to be light dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Friesen3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Zhang1">[32]</xref>. Using heterologously expressed SnTox1 and the avirulent isolate carrying the <italic>SnTox1</italic> gene, we showed clearly that the necrosis and disease susceptibility induced by SnTox1 on <italic>Snn1</italic> lines were completely dependent on light. The requirement of light for resistance to biotrophic disease as well as susceptibility to necrotrophic disease suggests a common host mechanism shared by reactions to the two classes of disease interactions.</p>
        <p>The molecular mechanism underlying the light dependency of plant pathogen interactions is still poorly understood; however, research on the ToxA-<italic>Tsn1</italic> interaction has shown that ToxA is internalized in the plant cell followed by localization to the chloroplast and induction of photosystem alterations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Ciuffetti2">[40]</xref>), providing a hint for the influence of light on this interaction. Recently, it was demonstrated that <italic>Tsn1</italic> is regulated by light and its expression is significantly suppressed in the dark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Faris1">[15]</xref>, providing a possible explanation for the light dependency of the ToxA-<italic>Tsn1</italic> interaction. SnTox1 is cysteine rich and therefore possibly acts in the apoplastic space. If SnTox1 remains in the apoplastic space, different mechanisms would likely be involved even though both are dependent on light. In Arabidopsis, plants kept in the dark do not accumulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the chloroplasts and show significantly delayed HR cell death after a resistance signaling pathway is activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Liu5">[49]</xref>. This indicates that light is required for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in chloroplasts and that this H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is critical to programmed cell death. The DAB staining in CS (<italic>Snn1</italic>) leaves infiltrated with SnTox1 was found to be associated with the chloroplast and the CS plant infiltrated with SnTox1 showed no DAB staining if kept in the dark (data not shown), suggesting a similar mechanism underlying SnTox1-induced cell death. Very interestingly, we found that plants kept in the dark developed necrosis and disease symptoms once transitioned to a normal photoperiod. Therefore signal transduction appears to pause rather than stop in the absence of light. This may indicate that the SnTox1 signal is progressing to the chloroplast but this process is interrupted in the absence of light.</p>

        <title>SnTox1 functions like a biotrophic effector to induce PCD in <italic>Snn1</italic> host lines</title>
        <p>Biotrophic effectors often function as elicitors of programmed cell death (PCD) thereby activating the resistance response in host plants containing the corresponding resistance genes. The host resistance reaction begins with the direct or indirect recognition of the pathogen-produced effector by the resistance gene product, followed by a complicated signaling pathway and a series of biochemical and physiological responses in host plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Greenberg1">[74]</xref>. The host response often includes an oxidative burst, cell wall restructuring, PR-gene expression and antimicrobial compound production culminating in a localized cell death at the infection site. This PCD is known as a hypersensitive response and is typically aimed at halting further colonization by the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Dodds1">[5]</xref>. A set of biochemical tests has shown that SnTox1 is able to induce resistance-like host responses and PCD evidenced by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, stronger expression of PR-genes, and DNA laddering in lines carrying <italic>Snn1</italic>. It is important to note that SnTox1 physiologically evoked a widespread necrotic flecking on the <italic>Snn1</italic> line, which is symptomatically similar to the hypersensitive response in biotrophic disease systems. However, this necrosis spreads into larger lesions resulting in susceptibility (sporulation) rather than resistance (prevention or inhibition of sporulation). Together, this indicates that SnTox1 is likely functioning biochemically and physiologically similar to a biotrophic effector (avirulence factor) in the presence of <italic>Snn1</italic> but with a different end result.</p>
        <p>A number of other necrotrophic effectors have also been shown to invoke a host resistance response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Wolpert1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Rudd1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Ciuffetti2">[40]</xref>. It has generally been thought that necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi possess simplistic infection mechanisms that rely on lytic and degrading enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Oliver1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, biotrophic fungal pathogen interactions have been considered more sophisticated due to the formation of special penetration and feeding structures, secretion of effectors to overcome plant PAMP triggered immunity and a constantly changing effector complement to avoid recognition by the plant innate immune system. However, three genes conferring sensitivity to necrotrophic effectors as well as susceptibility to the corresponding necrotrophic fungal pathogens have been cloned, and all possess resistance gene-like features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Faris1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Lorang1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Nagy1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, it seems that necrotrophic fungal pathogens may subvert plant resistance mechanisms for their own good. Here, we clearly showed that SnTox1 is an important virulence factor for <italic>S. nodorum</italic> in the presence of <italic>Snn1</italic> and that the host response to SnTox1 shows several similarities to a classical resistance response induced by many biotrophic effectors, however, the outcome of the host recognition was susceptibility rather than resistance.</p>
        <p><italic>SnTox1</italic> is the third effector gene that we have cloned and characterized from <italic>S. nodorum</italic>, which further strengthens the hypothesis that the wheat-<italic>S. nodorum</italic> pathosystem is based largely on host-effector interactions. The three effector genes cloned have provided molecular tools to study the mechanisms underlying disease in this system, an emerging model for necrotrophic fungal diseases.</p>

Under purifying selection, non-synonymous substitutions are expected to be rare, thus &#x3C9; will remain below 1. If non-synonymous mutations offer a selective advantage, they will be fixed at a higher rate than synonymous mutations and &#x3C9; will be greater than one. We compared the null model M1a (neutral), which assumes two site classes, purifying (0&lt;&#x3C9;<sub>0</sub>&lt;1) or neutral (&#x3C9;<sub>1</sub>&#x200A;=&#x200A;1) to the alternative model M2a (selection), which adds another class of diversifying sites (&#x3C9;<sub>2</sub>&gt;1). We also compared the more complex null model M7 (neutral) that assumes a beta distribution for 0&lt;&#x3C9;&lt;1, with the alternative model M8 (selection) which also assumes a beta distribution and adds an additional site class with &#x3C9;<sub>2</sub>&gt;1. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare the likelihood estimate scores. The model simultaneously calculates the posterior probability for each codon that belongs to a particular site class (e.i. &#x3C9;&gt;1). If the posterior probability for a codon is high and it belongs to the site class with &#x3C9;&gt;1, positive selection can be inferred for that codon, known as Bayes Empirical Bayes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002467-Yang2">[78]</xref>.</p>
