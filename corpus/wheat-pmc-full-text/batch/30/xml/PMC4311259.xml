      <abstract>
        <p>Genetic diversity and recombination patterns were evaluated for 229 isolates of <italic>Wheat dwarf virus</italic> (WDV), which are important cereal-infecting geminiviruses. Recombination hot spots were concentrated at the boundary of the genes encoding for the replication protein (<italic>Rep</italic>), the coat protein (<italic>cp</italic>) and the movement protein (<italic>mp</italic>), as well as inside <italic>Rep</italic> and <italic>cp</italic> and in the short intergenic regions (SIR). Phylogenomic analyses confirmed that the global population of WDV clustered into two groups according to their specific host: wheat and barley, and the crucial regions for the division of two groups were <italic>mp</italic> and the large intergenic regions (LIR). The computationally inferred pattern of coevolution between amino acid residues and the predicted 3D structure for the viral proteins provided further differences among the strains or species at the genome and protein level. Pervasive interaction between Rep and Rep A proteins in WDV-wheat-specific group reflected their important and complex function in the replication and transcription of WDV. Furthermore, significant predicted interactions between CP and Rep and CP and Rep A proteins in the WDV-wheat-specific group are thought to be crucial for successful encapsidation and movement of the virus during infection.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Geminiviruses are characterized by one or two small circular single-stranded (ss) DNA genomes and classified into four genera: <italic>Mastrevirus</italic>, <italic>Curtovirus</italic>, <italic>Topocuviru</italic>s, and <italic>Begomovirus</italic> based on viral vectors, host range and genomic characteristics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In the past 20 years, geminiviruses have caused devastating yield losses in vegetable and field crops, including tomato, beans, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, pepper, maize, and wheat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Many factors contribute to the emergence and spread of geminiviruses, including the evolution of variants through mutations, recombination and pseudo-recombination; acquisition of satellite-like DNA molecules; changes in cropping systems; and increases in the population and distribution of the insect vectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In addition, global climatic changes and human activity have also played an important role in the emergence of serious geminiviruses-induces diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The genetic diversity reflected in present-day geminiviruses will provide important insights into the evolution and biology of these important viruses.</p>
    <p>A number of key evolutionary steps must have occurred allowing geminiviruses to continue their adaptation to plants. Estimates of short-term and longer-term evolution rates are available for geminiviruses. The substitution rates of <italic>Beet curly top virus</italic> (BCTV) and <italic>Maize streak virus</italic> (MSV) are as high as 1.5 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> &#x2212; 3.8 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> substitution/site/year, similar to that of RNA viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Recombination has played and continues to play a pivotal role in geminiviral evolution, whose genome organization and rolling circle replication (RCR) have the potential to induce recombination in different parts of the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. A number of different mechanisms could be responsible for the observed patterns of recombination in geminiviruses, such as replication origins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, sequence similarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, ssDNA secondary structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, transcription&#x2013;replication clashes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and differential degrees of ssDNA exposure within mini-chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In the <italic>Curtovirus</italic> genus, the <italic>v-ori</italic> represents a recombination hotspot because of the replication release of viral genomes from genomic concatemers produced during RCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In some members of the <italic>Begomovirus</italic> genus, recombination can often be easily triggered between or among species that have identities as low as 82%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Strong statistical evidence of recombination hotspots was detected near the coat protein gene (<italic>cp</italic>)/short intergenic region (SIR) interface and at the <italic>v-ori</italic>, while a recombination cold spot spans almost the entire <italic>cp</italic> of MSV, a typical member of the <italic>Mastrevirus</italic> genus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
    <p><italic>Wheat dwarf virus</italic> (WDV) belongs to the genus <italic>Mastrevirus</italic> within the family <italic>Geminiviridae</italic>, which was first reported in the western parts of the Czech Republic and then in many other parts of the world<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Its ssDNA genome encodes four proteins: the coat protein (CP) and the movement protein (MP) on the viral sense strand and two replication-associated proteins (Rep and Rep A) on the complementary strand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The <italic>Rep</italic> gene of WDV possesses an intron of 86 nucleotides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The 3&#x2032; terminal part of the <italic>mp</italic> gene also serves as the initiation site of the <italic>cp</italic> gene, which is translated in the +1 reading frame relative to the <italic>mp</italic> reading frame<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The presence of an intron in the <italic>Rep</italic> gene makes it possible to produce two forms of the replication protein, Rep and Rep A. Splicing out of an intron leads to a larger Rep protein. Large and small intergenic regions (LIR and SIR, respectively) contain regulatory elements for viral replication and transcription. The LIR comprises the origin of the RCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The SIR contains polyadenylation signals and a region to which a short complementary primer for the second strand synthesis binds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
    <p>On the basis of a survey of field-derived cereal samples and on DNA sequences of distinct virus isolates, Schubert <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) proposed that WDV should be divided into three species: WDV, <italic>Barley dwarf virus</italic> (BDV) and <italic>Oat dwarf virus</italic> (ODV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Muhire <italic>et al.</italic> (2013) suggested ODV should be considered as a separate species and that WDV should be divided into five strains (named as A to E) based on genome-wide phylogenetic analyses, which have been approved by the executive committee of the ICTV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The LIR region was first checked for the recombination breakpoint in population of limited 28 Chinese isolates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, then with larger set of 30 isolates of WDV, and recombination between WDV and BDV was uncovered with many more hotspots, including the central part of the <italic>cp</italic>, the 3&#x2032;-terminal part of <italic>Rep</italic>, the 5&#x2032;-terminal part of <italic>Rep</italic>/<italic>RepA</italic> and the SIR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
    <p>In recent years, as wheat dwarf disease has spread more extensively across Europe, Africa and Asia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, many isolates of WDV have been sequenced, providing the opportunity to check whether new genetic variants have been generated by mutation and recombination. To explore this issue, we used the full genome sequences of 229 WDV and 1 ODV isolates to further reveal the population genetic structure and patterns of molecular evolution of these cereal-infecting geminiviruses. We also looked for discrepancies in the strains or species at the genome level for further research and understanding. Particular attention was given to prove whether the recombination patterns previously observed in other geminiviruses were conserved in WDV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. If so, the difference between strains or species of the WDV and ODV should be reflected in coevolutionary patterns among amino acids both at the intra- and the inter-proteins level of these viruses.</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic analyses of WDV and ODV populations</title>
        <p>For further identifying different strains within this worldwide WDV sample of 230 isolates, pairwise nucleotide identities were computed and a phylogenetic maximum credibility clade (MCC) tree generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, nucleotide identities are not shown). The resulting MCC tree was divided into WDV and ODV clusters. In the WDV cluster, WDV-wheat-specific and WDV-barley-specific groups were significantly separated. Six strains (A&#x2013;F) were detected based on the sequence similarity between isolates and the phylogenetic relationship; A and F strains were mainly from barley and B&#x2013;E were mainly form wheat, as clearly indicated in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; sequence similarities within strains A&#x2013;E were in the same range previously shown by Muhire <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and isolates from the new strain F had sequence similarities ranging from 97.86% to 100% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and &lt;94% with isolates from other clusters; for instance, the representative strain of type A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, AJ783960 had similarities &lt;94% with all those here included in the F group, being the lowest similarity of 93.19%. D strain, constituted only by two isolates from Iran, had the lowest similarity (94.11%), while A strain was in the order with 94.37% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). For minimizing the distorting effect that recombinant genomes may have on the phylogenetic relationship and identifying which of the viral genes may better help to define the two taxonomic groups, MCC trees with 209 non recombinant isolates were constructed using BEAST version 1.5.4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The MCC trees for <italic>cp</italic>, <italic>mp</italic>, <italic>Rep</italic>, LIR, and SIR + Intron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) all showed three major clusters: a WDV-wheat-specific group, a WDV-barley-specific group and ODV. Moreover, the isolates did not group strictly according to the host. The genes and intergenic region that better supported this division in two groups were as <italic>mp</italic>, LIR and SIR + Intron. For example, FJ620684-Iran-barley clustered with the WDV-wheat-specific group on the genomic sequence, <italic>cp</italic> and <italic>Rep</italic>, respectively, while in the MCC trees of <italic>mp</italic>, LIR and SIR + Intron, the strain belonged to the WDV-barley-specific group.</p>
        <p>The clusters reflected their geographical origin. The WDV-wheat-specific group had three branches; one with only Chinese isolates, the second with isolates from Europe and Iran, and the third branch with only the Iranian isolate JN791096-Iran-Bavanat-barley, which is the most ancient WDV isolate characterized so far. Isolates from Qinghai and Xinjiang regions of China occupied a basal position in the cluster of the Chinese population. The WDV-barley-specific group formed two clusters, one from Asia, another one from Europe. Only one German isolate of ODV was identified, and it always represented an independent branch in the MCC trees, regardless of the gene used.</p>
        <p>Phylodynamic analyses help to relate the phylogenetic history of a pathogen with its genetic variation, selection, transmission, and other epidemiological characteristics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Though the high similarity of the genomic sequences lowered the bootstrap support for the branches, the MCC trees of <italic>mp</italic>, <italic>cp</italic>, <italic>Rep</italic> and LIR showed the presence of three distinct clusters: WDV-wheat-specific group, WDV-barley-specific group and a third groups formed only by ODV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), consistent with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In our analysis with 229 isolates, a new strain was discovered, WDV-F, which is mainly found in Germany and mainly isolated from barley. Based on the genome-wide pairwise identity, isolates AJ783960, FJ620684, JQ647455, JN791096, and AM040732 were considered to be the reference strains for the five WDV strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However our recombination analyses have shown that isolates AJ783960 and JQ647455 were recombinants, so they must not be considered as good representatives. Moreover, isolates from China, France and Sweden grouped together, consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In the present study, the oldest isolates in WDV population were from Iran. Not surprisingly, Iran is in the Mesopotamia area, the origin of agriculture and of cultivated wheat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
        <p>In this study, we based the definition of strains only on two criteria, namely the pairwise percentage of nucleotide identity and the consistency of groups in the MCC phylogenetic tree, similar to what was previously done by Muhire et al. (2013)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Regarding possible biological differences between strains, it was not possible to see any differential symptoms among isolates. However some differences exist in term of host range: isolates belonging to the wheat-specific group infect barley, wheat, oat, rye, and triticale, while isolates from the barley-specific group infect only barley and only very rarely wheat (Habekuss, unpublished). Therefore, to some degree, these differences in host range give means the molecular data are supported by biological data to the clustering obtained from genomic sequence identities. Nevertheless relevant differences among strains on their biology need to be further explored, such as the infectivity rate of the leafhopper vector, differences in protein functions and so on.</p>

        <title>Evidence for recombination of WDV</title>
        <p>The split-decomposition network analysis showed the existence of conflicting phylogenetic signals among the 230 sequences including the ODV isolate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). This intricate reticulate-like pattern of evolution is consistent with extensive recombination among viral genomes, in contrast to a purely bifurcating tree that would reflect a steady diversification due to accumulation of point mutations. Recombination events were detected by seven of the eight statistical methods implemented in RDP4 with high probability (range <italic>P</italic> = 3.72 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;83</sup> to 1.14 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>). Overall, three events and 21 recombinant genomes were found. In general, recombination breakpoints were localized on the boundary of <italic>Rep</italic>, <italic>cp</italic> and <italic>mp</italic>, and inside <italic>Rep</italic>, <italic>cp</italic> and SIR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Recombinants in the first event were from the C strain, resulting from an exchange between the A and F strains, the breakpoints were laid in the middle of the intron (at about site 1943), the 5&#x2032; end of <italic>cp</italic> (at about nucleotide site 415; amino acid M1), and the 3&#x2032; end of <italic>Rep</italic> (at about nucleotides 1552 and 1375; amino acids Y320 and Y322) and <italic>mp</italic> (at about residues 391 and 397; amino acids I72 and G73) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The diagnosed recombinants were from Hungary and China with major parental sequences from Germany, Ukraine and Hungary, while minor parental sequences were from China. The reassembled fragments from the minor parent were 2093 nucleotides long. The second event was also from strain C with a single isolate from recombination between strains A and F with 1375 nucleotides, which affected the inner boundary of <italic>Rep</italic> (nucleotides 2500, 2493, 2426, 1625, 1618, and 1551; amino acids Y29, P7, G296, M321, P298, and A349). The regions with the 3&#x2032; terminus of <italic>cp</italic> (ca. nucleotide 1139; amino acid F242) as well as inside <italic>cp</italic> (residues 1082 and 1089; amino acids L223 and L225) and SIR (nucleotides 1296, 1297 and 1357) reflected the breakpoint locations of the third recombinant, which was from strain A, resulting from an exchange between strains F and B. The recombinants were mainly from European countries, such as Czech Republic, Spain, Austria, and Turkey. The major parental sequences were from Bulgaria, Ukraine and Germany, while the minor parental sequence in all cases was from isolate FJ620684-Iran-barley, donating 208&#x2013;222 nucleotides.</p>
        <p>The results of the three recombinant events support the following conclusions: (1) About 66.7% of the recombinants occurred between isolates from the WDV-wheat-specific group and the WDV-barley-specific group with about 2093 and 1375 nucleotides in the alignment, 33.3% of the recombinants were triggered in recombinations of the WDV-barley-specific group with about 210 nucleotides in the alignment. (2) Most recombination breakpoints were localized in the complementary sense genes. (3) Hot spot breakpoints were checked on the structural proteins of CP and Rep. (4) Recombinants resulted from the exchange of genetic material from viruses that are geographically distant (e.g., involving two or three countries). For instance, recombinant strains having a fragment from a German parental virus and another fragment from a Chinese parental virus were found in Hungary (Hungary-KP10-5). (5) The inter-strain recombination is common in WDV population.</p>
        <p>Previous investigations on recombination of <italic>Mastrevirus</italic> or <italic>Geminivirus</italic> have been incomplete; our study thus aimed to provide the strongest evidence for the role of recombination in the diversification of the genus <italic>Mastrevirus</italic>. Previous investigations on MSV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and WDV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> populations showed that v-<italic>ori</italic> was a combination hotspot, but we did not check this in the present study. However, the recombination event in the CP and Rep was similar between <italic>Nanovirus</italic> and <italic>Geminivirus</italic> DNA-1 satellite molecular data sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Mounting evidence from experimental and computational analyses suggests that the <italic>cp</italic> is a cold spot of recombination in mastreviruses and geminiviruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In our present study, we used the concatenated sequence of all of the genes and intergenic regions, while others used linear genomic sequences for analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. We first checked the CP protein as the hotspot of recombination in <italic>Mastrevirus</italic> and found the CP's breakpoints at amino acid positions L223, I/V226 and F242. Below, we will show that these breakpoints are under significant purification selection. Strong evolutionary constraints also existed for the R/G81, D/N83, Y320, Y322, I263, and P298 sites of Rep. Monjane <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> showed that Rep had a higher average degree of potential fold disruption than the CP did, which also reflected the greater stability of the CP with respect to Rep. Transcription&#x2013;replication clashes in the structural proteins of CP and Rep is one potential mechanism to explain the very common recombination. Therefore, further studies should uncover the importance of the recombinant fragment to the fitness of different isolates, such as in the second recombinant event, in which the minor exchanged sequences in Rep were fatal to the adaptation of isolate Hungary-KP10-5, which could better explain the replication of the isolate in the Hungarian wheat. These results also indicated a significant geographic structure; gene flow may still occur at the global scale. Moreover, in general, recombinant strains resulted from the exchange of a single fragment (i.e., a single recombination event); however, there were so many isolates that resulted from two or three recombination events, generating highly mosaic genomes.</p>
        <p>The key factor determining the survival of recombinants is the degree to which recombination disrupts coevolved intra-genomic interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. At the whole-genome scale, potentially disrupted interactions could include sequence&#x2013;specific interactions between viral proteins, DNA and RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Here, we focused on potential disruptions of sequence-specific interactions in the individual virus caused by the recombination and checked D346 of Rep in the WDV-wheat-specific group for a breakpoint of recombination and its implication in coevolving groups of amino acids (see below).</p>

        <title>Codon selection analyses</title>
        <p>We evaluated the selective constraints that potentially operated at each codon for each protein for three data sets: (1) for the whole population (209 isolates), (2) for the WDV-wheat-specific group (184 isolates) and (3) for the WDV-barley-specific group (24 isolates). In the whole population as well as the WDV-wheat-specific group, all proteins showed evidence of purification selection. However, Rep A showed the strongest selection pressure, followed by MP, Rep, and CP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In sharp contrast, in the case of the WDV-barley-specific group, MP was under positive selection, whereas the other proteins were under strong negative selection. The CP was the most conserved protein for both groups. The discrepancy in selection pressure on the proteins reflected the difference in the two groups. The region that affected the clustering of the two groups was Rep in the WDV-wheat-specific group; but in the WDV-barley-specific group, MP was the best. Interestingly, recombination breakpoints on P7, Y320 and Q351 of Rep were under significant positive selection, while most other breakpoints were either under purifying selection or neutral evolution with 79% rate (marked in the lower right corner of the amino acid sites in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>).</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Coevolution and binding site analyses</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that overlapping coding sequences of CP/MP and of Rep/Rep A should be coevolving and that amino acid residues within a single protein also could be interacting. To uncover any differences between two WDV-host-specific groups, coevolution analyses of intra- and inter-proteins were conducted. Through the analysis with the algorithms implemented in the software CAPS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, significant traits were found in two groups of WDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Above all, four proteins of the WDV-wheat-specific group show evidences of intra-protein coevolving sites, as did the proteins of the WDV-barley-specific group, except for the MP. The coevolving sites of each protein had its own characters. For the CP protein, the WDV-wheat-specific and WDV-barley-specific groups did not have the same sites. The wheat-specific group only had two site residues (A132 and T146), while the CP of the barley-specific group had six site residues (K33, T137, N190, I191, and V192, I233) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). In the WDV-wheat-specific group, Rep had more coevolving sites than Rep A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>); however, the two proteins had the same I94 site, which means it may play an essential evolutionary role for both proteins. The status of the coevolving inter-protein sites differed in the two groups of isolates. For the WDV-wheat-specific group, the coevolving sites between proteins were only reflected in CP/Rep, CP/Rep A and Rep/Rep A, while in the WDV-barley-specific group, the four proteins did not interact with each other at all. CP/Rep and CP/Rep A of the wheat-specific group involved six groups of coevolving sites with the same seven amino acids in CP (M15, P108, F109, A132, T146, T178, and T240) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>); these sites should play a functional role all together. In the WDV-wheat-specific group, Rep and Rep A, the A2, A6, T24, Y29, D32, N39, A48, and N157 were not only coevolving inter-protein, but also intra proteins, which also reflected their functional potential. Relationships of the inter-proteins MP/Rep or MP/Rep A were not found in either group. The MPs of the two groups did not have interactive sites with other proteins. However, MP could interact with CP and itself in the WDV-wheat-specific group, while it could not do so with CP or itself in WDV-barley-specific group. Since only one ODV isolate was available, we excluded it from the covariation analyses.</p>
        <p>The distribution of the positively selected sites along the tertiary structure of the proteins may illustrate which parts of the structure are more or less affected by selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In general, the evolutionary forces were unevenly distributed on every protein. In the WDV-wheat-specific group, CP only has one amino acid, A132, under positive selection in the two coevolving sites, and three fourths of the coevolving sites of the MP were under positive selection. At the same time, as the lapped site for coevolution of inter-protein with Rep and Rep A, the F109, T146, T178 and T240 of CP were under negative selection, which reflected their strong conservation involving in an important function. In Rep, 44% of the intra-protein coevolving sites were under negative selection or evolving neutrally, while in Rep A, only one eighth of intra-protein interactive sites were under positive selection. In the coevolving sites of inter-proteins CP/Rep and CP/Rep A, A2, A6, T24, Y29, D32, N39, A48, and N157 were common for both interactions, 56% of which were under positive selection. In the WDV-barley-specific group, most intra-protein coevolving sites of CP, Rep and Rep A were identified as under positive selection. I191 and I233 of CP as well as F89 of Rep and Rep A were under negative purifying selection.</p>
        <p>Moreover the D346 amino acid site of WDV-wheat-specific group was the only site involved both in significant coevolutinary interactions and also in recombination events. The extent in which changes in D346 may disrupt the integrated function of coevolving groups and their implication in establishing the right folding/function needs to be evaluated. To our knowledge, recombination and coevolution analyses have never been used to analyze any naturally generated chimeric proteins; we realized they should also be useful for understanding breakpoint distribution patterns found within coding regions of recombining virus genomes.</p>
        <p>Mapping predicted binding site residues on the predicted fold of each protein helped to highlight the differences between WDV and ODV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). Comparing the CP from two groups of WDV, we found that they shared the same coevolving sites: A123, V158, V159, K160, and R202 except for V203 of the CP in the barley-specific group. However, ODV CP had totally different highlighted binding sites, thus suggesting that different patterns of binding sites exist among the CP structures of WDV and ODV. In MP and Rep, the predicted binding sites residues were also quite different between WDV-wheat-specific and WDV-barley-specific groups and ODV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, whereas the amino acid identity between any two representatives of CP from WDV-wheat-specific group and barley-specific group was 84.6%, the amino acid identity between CP of WDV-wheat-specific group and ODV was 72.4%, and 73.9% between the CP of the WDV-barley-specific group and ODV, which also supports the divergence between ODV and the WDV types.</p>
        <p>Through these coevolutionary analyses and comparing the predictions of 3D structures generated by <italic>in silico</italic> protein folding algorithms for every protein, discrepancies among the WDV-wheat-specific group, the WDV-barley-specific group and ODV were further uncovered. Complex networks of evolutionary dependencies among amino acid residues helped to identify differences in the selective constraints that have been imposed on the two species (WDV and ODV), as well as to understand their functional significance in previous and future studies. Our bioinformatics results are a good complement to previous observations. For instance, CP proteins in <italic>Geminivirus</italic> were not only responsible for the encapsidation function, but also executed intra- as well as inter-plant virus transmission and yielded viral DNA with an ATPase function through the packaging and triggering of the replication function of Rep in the infected tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. There is a reasonably strong interaction between Rep and CP reported in <italic>Mung bean yellow mosaic India virus</italic> in the region of Rep spanning amino acids H120 to 362 bound by GST-CP2 in yeast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In the WDV-wheat-specific group, the CP had intra-protein interaction and inter-protein interaction with Rep and Rep A, while the WDV-barley-specific group did not. From this case, the difference between two groups was significant. Strong interactions for Rep A/Rep A and Rep/Rep were previously found for MSV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In our study, we observed significant interactions between Rep A and Rep for the WDV-wheat-specific group, but we failed to detect similar interactions in the WDV-barley-specific group.</p>
        <p>In the research of Schubert <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, because of the limited set of 30 sequences, recombination was uncovered only within WDV-B strain. Our research with a much larger set of WDV isolates revealed that recombinants were triggered between the WDV-wheat-specific group and the barley-specific group, and we also evaluated purification selection as a modulator of the observed recombination pattern. Following the naming of the WDV strain and establishment of classification standards for <italic>Mastrivirus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, we suggested that a new strain, F, should be proposed. At the same time, the discrepancies between the WDV-wheat-specific and barley-specific groups were further explored using coevolutionary networks of amino acids and 3D structure prediction of proteins, including coevolving amino acid residues at the inter- and intra-protein levels, binding site residues and predicted active site residues analyses. Future studies should continue testing and verifying the characteristics of every protein of WDV and ODV, e.g using yeast two-hybrid, BiFC or co-immunoprecipitation experiments.</p>

        <title>Coevolution analysis</title>
        <p>To identify correlated variation among amino acid sites, in particular those with evidence of selection pressures, we analyzed coevolution within and between MP, CP, Rep, and Rep A proteins. Coevolution was identified using the program CAPS version 1.0<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The algorithm implemented in CAPS has been shown to outperform other coevolution-detection methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Briefly, this program identifies covariation between pairs of sites in the multiple sequence alignment by calculating the correlation in the variation in amino acid patterns between both sites. The BLOSUM amino acid substitution matrix is then used to score the strength of the amino acid variation for a particular amino acid site, and these scores are corrected by taking into account the divergence time between the sequences of the multiple sequence alignment (measured as the estimated number of synonymous substitutions). The significance of the correlation coefficients was tested using 10,000 pseudo-random pairs of amino acid sites and a confidence value &#x3B1; = 0.001. We also tested whether coevolving amino acids can be used to predict protein&#x2013;protein contact interfaces. Both intra- and inter-domains analyses were performed.</p>
        <p>Structural clustering of coevolving sites could shed light on their functional and structural reciprocal selective constraints. We previously modeled the 3D structure of WDV CP, MP and Rep proteins using the I-TASSER platform, a program that iteratively conducts threading assembly refinement starting with a single amino acid and generating 3D atomic models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. The modeling is performed in three stages. First, the query sequence is PSI-blasted against a non-redundant sequence database and secondary structures predicted with PSIPRED<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Then, the sequence and the predicted secondary structures are submitted against a PDB structure library using a suit of seven threading programs, all compiled in LOMETS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Second, continuous fragments are excised from threading alignments and assembled to build structural conformations, with the structure of non-aligned regions modeled <italic>ab initio</italic>. Third, a consensus set of models, those that are closest to the centroid of the simulations, is used to refine the models. The final stage of the modeling provides a set of models and their corresponding scores (TM scores), with the highest score referring to the best model.</p>
