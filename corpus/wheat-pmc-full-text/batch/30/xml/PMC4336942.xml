      <abstract>
        <p>Wheat scab caused by <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is an important disease. In a previous study, the <italic>FGK3</italic> glycogen synthase kinase gene orthologous to mammalian GSK3 was identified as an important virulence factor. Although GSK3 orthologs are well-conserved, none of them have been functionally characterized in fungal pathogens. In this study, we further characterized the roles of <italic>FGK3</italic> gene. The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant had pleiotropic defects in growth rate, conidium morphology, germination, and perithecium formation. It was non-pathogenic in infection assays and blocked in DON production. Glycogen accumulation was increased in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant, confirming the inhibitory role of Fgk3 on glycogen synthase. In <italic>FGK3</italic>-GFP transformants, GFP signals mainly localized to the cytoplasm in conidia but to the cytoplasm and nucleus in hyphae. Moreover, the expression level of <italic>FGK3</italic> increased in response to cold, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and SDS stresses. In the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant, cold, heat, and salt stresses failed to induce the expression of the stress response-related genes <italic>FgGRE2, FgGPD1, FgCTT1</italic>, and <italic>FgMSN2</italic>. In the presence of 80&#x2005;mM LiCl, a GSK3 kinase inhibitor, the wild type displayed similar defects to the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant. Overall, our results indicate that <italic>FGK3</italic> is important for growth, conidiogenesis, DON production, pathogenicity, and stress responses in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>.</p>

  <body>
    <p>F<italic>usarium graminearum</italic> is the predominant species that causes Fusarium head blight (WHB) or scab of wheat and barley worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Under favorable conditions, it can cause severe yield losses, and often contaminates infected grains with harmful mycotoxins. One of the mycotoxins produced by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis and an important virulence factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The trichothecene biosynthetic gene clusters and biosynthesis pathways in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and related species have been extensively studied in the past decade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>To better understand fungal pathogenesis, we systematically characterized protein kinase genes in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In total, 42 of them were found to be important for pathogenicity or virulence in infection assays with flowering wheat heads and corn stalks. In addition to components of the well-conserved cAMP signaling and MAP kinase pathways, we found 31 protein kinase genes that had not been previously characterized as important pathogenicity factors. One of them, FGSG_07329, is orthologous to the mammalian GSK3&#x3B2; glycogen synthase kinase gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>GSK3 orthologs from different eukaryotic organisms, including mammals, insects, fungi, nematodes, and protozoa, have similar structures and well-conserved ATP binding sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Although GSK3 was first characterized as a Ser/Thr protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase, later studies have shown that GSK3 functions in multiple cellular processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In addition to enzymes involved in metabolism, its substrates include structural and signaling proteins, as well as transcription factors. In mammalian cells, GSK3 plays roles in many signaling pathways that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, microtubule dynamics, development, and oncogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Alzheimer's disease is one of several human diseases that are known to be related to the hyperactivity of GSK3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In plants, GSK3 kinases function in hormonal signaling networks that involve brassinosteroids, abscisic acid, and auxin during growth and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. They also play roles in floral organ development and cell expansion, as well as in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
    <p>Although <italic>F. graminearum</italic> contains only one, the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has four <italic>GSK3</italic> orthologs, <italic>MCK1</italic>, <italic>RIM11</italic>, <italic>MRK1</italic>, and <italic>YGK3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Whereas <italic>RIM11</italic> is paralogous to <italic>MRK1</italic>, <italic>MCK1</italic> is paralogous to <italic>YGK3</italic>. Both pairs arose from the genome duplication event. <italic>MCK1</italic> plays roles in mitotic chromosome segregation and regulation of Ime1, which interacts with Ume6 to activate the transcription of early meiosis genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. <italic>MCK1</italic> also facilitates cell cycle delay in response to calcium stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. <italic>RIM11</italic> is also required for entering meiosis by phosphorylation of Ime1 and Ume6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The expression of <italic>RIM11</italic> increases in response to DNA replication stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In contrast, both <italic>YGK3</italic> and <italic>MRK1</italic> play roles in protein degradation and Msn2-dependent transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. <italic>YGK3</italic> is also required for optimal growth under zinc-limiting conditions but the <italic>MRK1</italic> deletion mutant had no obvious defects in growth, colony morphology, and glycogen accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
    <p>In <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, <italic>GSK3</italic> is involved in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, which plays a role in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, the SREBP pathway also plays roles in the connection between oxygen sensing, CoCl<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, and virulence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The X-ray structure of <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> Gsk3 was analyzed, and type- II kinase inhibitors were demonstrated to have inhibitory effects on Gsk3 and the potential to be developed into anti-fungal agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the <italic>skp1</italic> gene encodes a protein that shares 67% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian GSK3&#x3B2;. The <italic>skp1</italic> deletion mutant was sensitive to heat shock and exhibited defects in sporulation. Overexpression of <italic>skp1</italic> complemented the defects of the <italic>cdc14</italic> mutant in cytokinesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
    <p>GSK3 orthologs are well conserved in filamentous ascomycetes. However, none of them have been functionally characterized. All of the plant pathogenic fungi that have been sequenced contain at least one GSK3 ortholog, but their functions in plant infection have not been identified. In this study, we characterized the roles of the GSK3 ortholog in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (named <italic>FGK3</italic> for <italic><underline>F</underline>. graminearum</italic><italic><underline>G</underline>S<underline>K</underline>3</italic>). Compared to the wild type strain, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant had pleiotropic defects in growth rate, conidium morphology, germination, perithecium formation, and glycogen accumulation. Moreover, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was non-pathogenic in infection assays with flowering wheat heads and blocked in DON production. The expression level of <italic>FGK3</italic> increased in responses to different environmental stressors. In the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant, the up-regulation of the <italic>FgGRE2</italic>, <italic>FgGPD1</italic>, <italic>FgCTT1</italic>, and <italic>FgMSN2</italic> genes that are known to be involved in general stress responses by environmental stresses was diminished. These results indicate that the <italic>FGK3</italic> gene is important for hyphal growth, conidiogenesis, DON production, pathogenicity, glycogen accumulation, and stress responses in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>.</p>

        <title>FGSG_07329 (<italic>FGK3</italic>) encodes a typical GSK3 protein kinase</title>
        <p><italic>FGK3</italic> encodes a 394 amino acid protein that contains a well-conserved protein kinase domain from residues 35 to 318. Like other GSK3 orthologs, the rest of Fgk3 (apart from the kinase domain) is not similar to any known motif or domain. Fgk3 shares 65% identity in amino acid sequences with the human GSK3&#x3B2; kinase. Its orthologs are also well conserved in filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that FOPG_04806 of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and FVEG_07936 of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> are closely related to <italic>FGK3</italic>, both sharing 99% sequence identity.</p>

        <title>The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant is defective in growth, conidiogenesis, and conidium germination</title>
        <p>The <italic>FGK3</italic> gene replacement construct was generated and transformed into the wild-type strain PH-1 in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The resulting &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> transformants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S2</xref>). In comparison with PH-1, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant E2 was significantly reduced in growth rate on CM plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). Colonies formed by mutant E2 had yellowish pigmentation and limited aerial hyphal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Microscopic examination further revealed that the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant had uneven hyphal width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was also significantly reduced in conidiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). Microscopic examination showed that deletion of <italic>FGK3</italic> resulted in defects in phialide formation. Conidia were often directly formed on hyphal branches instead of on phialides, which may be directly responsible for reduced conidiation in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was also defective in conidium morphology. Conidia of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant were shorter and had fewer septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, the tip compartments of mutant conidia were often elongated and strongly curved, forming hook-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A; 2B</xref>), while the middle compartments of conidia often contained multiple nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>FGK3</italic> is important for conidiogenesis and septation or cytokinesis during conidium formation.</p>
        <p>When incubated in liquid YEPD, conidia of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant were able to germinate from the end and middle compartments like the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, germ tube growth appeared to be reduced in mutant E2. After incubation for 6&#x2005;h, germ tubes of mutant E2 were shorter than those of PH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). By 20&#x2005;h, germ tubes of PH-1 also had branched more than those of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The defect of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant in germ tube growth was consistent with its reduced growth rate.</p>

        <title>The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant is blocked in sexual reproduction</title>
        <p>Because ascospores play a critical role in the infection cycle of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, we also assayed sexual reproduction with the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant on carrot agar plates as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. At 14 days post-fertilization (dpf), the wild type produced mature perithecia with ascospore cirrhi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Under the same conditions, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant failed to produce perithecia and protoperithecia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>FGK3</italic> plays an essential role in sexual reproduction in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant must be blocked in the early sexual developmental processes and have lost female fertility.</p>

        <title><italic>FGK3</italic> is important for plant infection and DON production</title>
        <p>In infection assays with flowering wheat heads, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant rarely caused symptoms on the inoculated wheat kernels and never spread to neighboring spikelets on the same head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The average disease index of the mutant was less than 0.5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), which was significantly lower than that of PH-1. In infection assays with corn silks, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant also was defective in plant infection. PH-1 caused extensive lesions spreading along corn silks 5&#x2005;dpi, but the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant did not cause any discoloration beyond the inoculation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results indicated that the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was significantly reduced in virulence. Therefore, <italic>FGK3</italic> must play a critical role in plant infection and spreading in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>
        <p>Because DON is an important virulence factor in <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, we then assayed DON production in diseased wheat kernels. Whereas DON content in PH-1 exceeded 1,600&#x2005;ppm, DON production in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was not detectable in inoculated wheat kernels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, in addition to its reduced growth rate, defects of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant in DON biosynthesis may also contribute to its defects in plant infection.</p>

        <title>Complementation assays and subcellular localization of <italic>FGK3</italic>-GFP fusion proteins</title>
        <p>The <italic>FGK3</italic>-GFP fusion construct was generated by the yeast gap repair approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and transformed into the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant. The resulting &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic>/<italic>FGK3</italic>-GFP transformant C1 was identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. It was normal in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), sexual reproduction, and plant infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, fusion with GFP had no effect on <italic>FGK3</italic> function, and expression of <italic>FGK3</italic>-GFP rescued the defects of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, when examined for GFP signal in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic>/<italic>GSK3</italic>-GFP transformant C1, Fgk3-GFP mainly localized to the cytoplasm in conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, GFP signals were observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in 12&#x2005;h germlings or hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The alteration in the subcellular localization of Fgk3-GFP fusion may be related to its diverse functions in different stages.</p>

        <title>Deletion of <italic>FGK3</italic> increased glycogen accumulation in conidia</title>
        <p>In mammalian cells, GSK3 is a glycogen synthase kinase that inhibits the activity of glycogen synthase. To determine the effect of <italic>FGK3</italic> deletion on glycogen synthesis, we stained glycogen in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In comparison with the wild-type conidia, mutant conidia accumulated more glycogen, although they were defective in morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, the distribution of glycogen appeared to be uneven among different conidium compartments in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). These results indicated that deletion of <italic>FGK3</italic> increases glycogen synthase activities in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant.</p>

        <title>Lithium chloride treatment mimics deletion of <italic>FGK3</italic></title>
        <p>Lithium is known to be an inhibitor of mammalian GSK3&#x3B2;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. When treated with increasing concentrations of LiCl, from 5 to 80&#x2005;mM, the growth rate of PH-1 on PDA was reduced accordingly in increments. In the presence of 80&#x2005;mM LiCl, hyphal growth in PH-1 was reduced to a level comparable with that of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). Colonies of cultures treated with 80&#x2005;mM LiCl were more compact, and had darker pigmentation and fewer aerial hyphae than those of untreated PH-1 cultures.

Under the same conditions, PH-1 cultures had no obvious changes in growth rate or colony morphology in the presence of up to 80&#x2005;mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Conidia produced by PH-1 in CMC with 80&#x2005;mM LiCl also had morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>), although LiCl treatment did not impact conidiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). In the presence of 80&#x2005;mM LiCl, PH-1 produced smaller conidia with curved tip compartments and fewer septa, akin to the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant. These conidia also accumulated a higher degree of glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, conidia produced by PH-1 in CMC cultures with 80&#x2005;mM KCl had normal morphology and glycogen accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

        <p>Severe defects of conidium morphology in the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant may be due to abnormal microtubule organization, which is normally a key component of the cytoskeleton involved in maintaining cellular structures.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The <italic>FGK3</italic> gene encodes a typical glycogen synthase kinase with a highly conserved protein kinase domain. In animals and plants, GSK3 kinases are known to be related to growth and differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has four GSK3 homologs, <italic>MCK1</italic>, <italic>RIM11</italic>, <italic>MRK1</italic>, and <italic>YGK3</italic>. Whereas <italic>MCK1</italic> is required for growth at extreme temperatures, the other three have no significant effect on vegetative growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> although overexpression of <italic>RIM11</italic> increases filamentous growth in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant had severe defects in vegetative growth, with a 90% reduction in growth rate. These results indicate that <italic>FGK3</italic> may have a more pronounced effect on vegetative growth in filamentous fungi than in yeasts.</p>
      <p>In comparison with the wild type, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant also was reduced approximately 90% in conidiation. Microscopic examination revealed that the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant often produced singular phialides or conidia directly on hyphal branches or tips. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, several mutants, including the &#x394;<italic>FGSG_08631</italic>, &#x394;<italic>Fgrim15</italic>, &#x394;<italic>Fgdbf2</italic>, &#x394;<italic>Fgcdc15</italic>, &#x394;<italic>FgstuA</italic>, and &#x394;<italic>FgabaA</italic> mutants, are known to be significantly reduced in conidiation and unable to form clusters of phialides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The growth rates of the &#x394;<italic>Fgdbf2</italic> and &#x394;<italic>Fgcdc15</italic> mutants were significantly reduced, while the &#x394;<italic>Fgrim15</italic> and &#x394;<italic>FGSG_08631</italic> mutants had no obvious defects in vegetative growth. Therefore, defects in growth rate are not directly related to defects in the production of conidiophores or phialides on vegetative hyphae in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant failed to produce perithecia or protoperithecia on carrot agar plates, indicating that <italic>FGK3</italic> is essential for sexual reproduction in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, which has ascospores as the primary inoculum. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, sporulation was blocked in the &#x394;<italic>rim11</italic> mutant and severely decreased in the &#x394;<italic>mck1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>mrk1</italic> mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. <italic>RIM11</italic> phosphorylates the master transcriptional activator Ime1, which facilitates the transcription of several early meiosis-specific genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The single GSK3 homolog in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> may possess similar or combined functions to its four homologs in the budding yeast and promote the transcription of numerous early meiosis-specific genes. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the <italic>skp1</italic> gene is not essential for meiosis or sporulation. However, in the <italic>skp1</italic> null mutant, the rate of sporulation was decreased, and ascospores had abnormal morphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Deletion of <italic>FGK3</italic> in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> completely blocked sexual developmental processes. Because it failed to produce protoperithecia, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant must be blocked before the formation of croziers and diploid cells, which occurs prior to meiosis in Sordariomycetes.</p>
      <p>The &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was significantly reduced in virulence, to the point where it was almost non-pathogenic. One contributing factor is its severe defects in hyphal growth. In addition, the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant was defective in DON production in inoculated wheat kernels and DON is the first and best characterized virulence factor in <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>FGK3</italic> also plays a critical role in regulating responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other environmental stresses, and it is well known that oxidative burst is a common plant defense response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Increased sensitivity to environmental stresses may be another factor causing reduced virulence of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant. In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, disruption of <italic>GSK3</italic> resulted in decreased virulence in a murine intravenous model, which was mainly due to defects in the SREBP pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Defects of the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant in plant infection suggest <italic>FGK3</italic> and its orthologs may have a conserved role in fungal pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>Mammalian GSK3&#x3B2; is a multifunctional protein kinase. Its substrates are present from the cytosol to the nucleus, such as cyclin D1 in the nucleus and glycogen synthase in the cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Changes in the localization of GSK3&#x3B2; are dependent on the cell cycle, with the amount of GSK3&#x3B2; present in the nucleus increasing during the S phase in NIH3T3 cells. In the budding yeast, Rim11 plays a role in promoting the transcription of several meiotic genes. It is mobilized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when cells enter the meiotic stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Our results showed that Fgk3-GFP fusion proteins had different subcellular localization patterns in conidia and hyphae, indicating that Fgk3 may also have different substrates at various growth or developmental stages in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In conidia, the fungus is in a dormant state and Fgk3 may function to inhibit glycogen synthesis by localizing to the cytoplasm. However, in growing hyphae or germ tubes, Fgk3 may localize to the nucleus to promote the transcription of various genes important for primary metabolism and cell cycle progression.</p>
      <p>Lithium is known to inhibit the activity of mammalian GSK3&#x3B2;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. PH-1 treated with 80&#x2005;mM lithium chloride had similar defects to the &#x394;<italic>fgk3</italic> mutant, except for conidiation. As a control, treatment with 80&#x2005;mM KCl had no obvious effect on hyphal growth and conidium morphology in the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Because lithium is not a specific inhibitor of GSK3 kinases, it also has other targets, including inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), phosphomonoesterase, and phosphoglucomutase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. The presence of LiCl may be inhibitory to these targets other than Fgk3, which may in turn reduce or eliminate the adverse effect of <italic>Fgk3</italic> inhibition on conidiation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, 50&#x2005;mM LiCl caused defects in budding, leading to a higher amount of unbudded cells than untreated yeast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Therefore, although lithium has a universal inhibitory effect on GSK3 kinases, its effects on growth and development may vary among different species.</p>
      <p>The expression of <italic>FGK3</italic> was increased in response to cold, oxidative, and SDS stresses. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>MCK1</italic> played an important role in cell wall integrity signaling. The <italic>mck1</italic> mutant had increased sensitivity to environmental stresses such as elevated temperatures and 0.01% SDS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. However, deletion of either <italic>MRK1</italic> or <italic>YGK3</italic> had only minor effects on resistance to SDS and heat shock. General stress responses in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> are regulated by the transcription factor <italic>MSN2</italic> and its paralog <italic>MSN4</italic>, both of which bind to the STRE element of stress-inducible genes for various stressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. We found that cold-induced up-regulation of <italic>FgMSN2</italic> is dependent on <italic>FGK3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>) in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In yeast two-hybrid assays, Fgk3 physically interacted with Msn2. Therefore, Fsk3 may regulate the expression of stress-response related genes, such as <italic>FgGRE2</italic>, <italic>FgGPD1</italic>, and <italic>FgCTT1</italic>, by directly interacting with FgMsn2 and/or affecting the expression level of FgMsn2.</p>
      <p>Because <italic>FGK3</italic> is essential for plant infection and DON production, it is suitable as a candidate gene to use the host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) approach for controlling wheat head blight. Recently, silencing the <italic>CYP51A/B/C</italic> genes by HIGS was shown to be effective for protection against <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that transgenic plants expressing the RNAi construct of <italic>FGK3</italic> will be resistant to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection or reduced in DON contamination. The Fgk3 kinase is known to interact with other protein kinases that are important for various developmental and infection processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Some of these genes functionally related to Fgk3 also can be explored as the targets for controlling Fusarium head blight.</p>

The inoculated wheat kernels with FHB disease symptoms were harvested and assayed for DON production as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Corn silk and corn stalk infection assays were conducted as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.</p>

        <title>Yeast two-hybrid assays</title>
        <p>Protein-protein interactions were assayed with the Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Whereas the <italic>FGK3</italic> ORF was amplified from first-strand cDNA of PH-1 and cloned into pGBK7 as the bait construct, the <italic>FgMSN2</italic> ORF was cloned into pGADT7 as the prey construct. The resulting bait and prey vectors were co-transformed into the yeast strain AH109. The Leu<sup>+</sup> and Trp<sup>+</sup> transformants were isolated and assayed for growth on SD-Trp-Leu-His medium and galactosidase activities in filter lift assays. The positive and negative controls were provided in the Matchmaker Library Construction &amp; Screening Kits (Clontech).</p>

RNA samples were then isolated from germlings harvested by filtration and used in qRT-PCR assays for the expression levels of (A) <italic>FgGPD1</italic>, (B) <italic>FgGRE2,</italic> (C) <italic>FgCTT1</italic>, and (D) <italic>FgMSN2</italic>. CT: control, untreated PH-1. Mean and standard deviations were calculated with results from three independent replicates.</p>
