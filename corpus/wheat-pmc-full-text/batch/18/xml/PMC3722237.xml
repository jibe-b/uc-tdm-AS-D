      <abstract>
        <p>Earlier we identified wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) chromosome 3A as a major determinant of grain yield and its component traits. In the present study, a high-density genetic linkage map of 81 chromosome 3A-specific markers was developed to increase the precision of previously identified yield component QTLs, and to map QTLs for biomass-related traits. Many of the previously identified QTLs for yield and its component traits were confirmed and were localized to narrower intervals. Four novel QTLs one each for shoot biomass (<italic>Xcfa2262-Xbcd366</italic>), total biomass (<italic>wPt2740-Xcfa2076</italic>), kernels/spike (KPS) (<italic>Xwmc664-Xbarc67</italic>), and <italic>Pseudocercosporella</italic> induced lodging (<italic>Ps</italic>IL) were also detected. The major QTLs identified for grain yield (GY), KPS, grain volume weight (GVWT) and spikes per square meter (SPSM) respectively explained 23.2%, 24.2%, 20.5% and 20.2% of the phenotypic variation. Comparison of the genetic map with the integrated physical map allowed estimation of recombination frequency in the regions of interest and suggested that QTLs for grain yield detected in the marker intervals <italic>Xcdo549-Xbarc310</italic> and <italic>Xpsp3047-Xbarc356</italic> reside in the high-recombination regions, thus should be amenable to map-based cloning. On the other hand, QTLs for KPS and SPSM flanked by markers <italic>Xwmc664</italic> and <italic>Xwmc489</italic> mapped in the low-recombination region thus are not suitable for map-based cloning. Comparisons with the rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) genomic DNA sequence identified 11 candidate genes (CGs) for yield and yield related QTLs of which chromosomal location of two (<italic>CKX2</italic> and <italic>GID2-like</italic>) was confirmed using wheat aneuploids. This study provides necessary information to perform high-resolution mapping for map-based cloning and for CG-based cloning of yield QTLs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Grain yield is one of the most important targets for agricultural research, as well as for sustaining human and livestock populations on this planet. In addition to securing global food resources, grain yield is also important for understanding history of crop domestication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Gegas1">[1]</xref>. Grain yield in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) can be largely partitioned into three major components: kernel number per spike, kernel weight, and spikes or reproductive tillers per unit area. These traits are affected by other traits including anthesis date, plant biomass, and plant height. Each yield component trait is controlled by multiple loci following complex genetic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Dhungana1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Xing1">[3]</xref>. Some of the component traits, such as grain weight and plant height, are more stably inherited compared to others including grain number and root/shoot biomass that are more variable in nature and show stronger genotype by environment interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Gupta1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>QTLs for yield or its component traits have been mapped on wheat homoeologous groups 2, 3, 5 and 7 chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Gupta1">[4]</xref> of which QTLs on chromosome 3A are by far the best characterized and are the most reproducibly detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Baenziger1">[5]</xref>. Initial identification of chromosome 3A as a major determinant of grain yield came from the studies conducted on a full set of chromosome substitution lines developed from two historically important hard red winter wheat cultivars, Wichita (WI) and Cheyenne (CNN). WI chromosomes 3A and 6A when substituted for the corresponding CNN chromosomes showed 19% and 14% yield advantage, respectively over CNN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Berke1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Berke2">[7]</xref>. The reciprocal substitution lines for these chromosomes respectively showed 17% and 23% reduction in grain yield in comparison with WI.</p>
      <p>Initial mapping of QTLs to sub-chromosomal region(s) on 3A was performed relative to 13 DNA markers using a set of 50 recombinant inbred chromosome lines (RICLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Shah1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Shah2">[9]</xref>. QTLs for various yield component traits including anthesis date, plant height, kernel number per spike, 1000-kernel weight and spike number per square meter were identified but not for the grain yield itself. The complex nature of the trait, smaller population size, low map resolution, and strong genotype by environment interaction probably prevented detection of QTL(s) for grain yield. This study was further refined by increasing the population size to 95 RICLs (including the original set of 50 RICLs) and the molecular marker number to 20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell1">[10]</xref>. Four major chromosomal regions harboring QTLs for grain yield and various component traits were identified. In a follow-up study, the number of 3A-specific markers was increased to 41 that further improved the precision of QTL analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Dilbirligi1">[11]</xref>. The population size was then increased to 223 RICLs by mapping 32 chromosome 3A-specific markers on 128 additional RICLs generated by doubled haploid (DH) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Ali1">[12]</xref>. The complete set of 223 RICLs was evaluated for yield and its component traits for six environment years from 2005 to 2007, and the data was used for QTL analysis. In addition to confirming many of the previously identified QTLs and improving resolution in a few cases, the study showed that the two RICL development methods have similar power of QTL detection, thus can be interchangeably used.</p>
      <p>Most of the QTLs detected on chromosome 3A mainly mapped to two regions, namely region 1 and region 2, respectively overlapping with the gene-rich regions 3S0.9 (46 Mb; 1.1 Mb/cM) demarcated by the deletion breakpoint of 3BS-3, and 3S0.8 (25 Mb; 0.58 Mb/cM) by 3BS-8 and 3AS-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell1">[10]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Erayman1">[13]</xref>. Localization of these QTLs was later reconfirmed by the use of a mirror population WI(CNN3A) of 90 RICLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Mengistu1">[14]</xref>. As in previous studies, QTLs for various yield components co-localized to the two chromosomal regions. To determine if the co-localization is a consequence of tight linkage or pleiotropy, it is important to increase marker density and map resolution.</p>
      <p>Objectives of the present study were to: i) increase the marker density of the 3A map to localize QTLs to narrower intervals; ii) identify QTLs for biomass related traits including root and shoot biomass in wheat, and iii) identify rice genomic regions corresponding with the QTL-containing regions of wheat to identify additional markers and genes putatively underlying the QTLs. Furthermore, we intended to compare number and quality of QTLs identified from greenhouse evaluation with that from multi-location field trials, and effect of increasing the marker number with plant number on the efficacy of QTL detection and resolution.</p>

        <p>Genetic analyses of agronomically important traits were performed using a set of 95 chromosome 3A specific recombinant inbred chromosome lines (3A-RICLs), derived from a cross between wheat cultivar Cheyenne (CNN) and its substitution lines CNN(WI3A), carrying chromosome 3A from wheat cultivar Wichita (WI). Procedure for the development of the RICL population was described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Shah1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Shah2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Yen1">[15]</xref>. An extended set of 223 RICLs including the above 95 RICLs was also used for genotyping and map construction. The objective of using the extended population was to study the effect of increasing population size on the map resolution. The procedure for the development of the 128 additional RICLs was described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Ali1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Phenotypic data on the 95 RICLs along with five check cultivars (Goodstreak, Pronghorn, Arapahoe, Jagger and WI) were gathered in two different ways: (i) in field, at three different locations (Lincoln, Mead and Sidney, NE) for seven years including 1999 to 2001 and 2005 to 2008, and (ii) in the greenhouse. In 1999, 2007 and 2008, the phenotypic data was collected respectively at Lincoln (NE), Mead (NE) and Pullman (WA), and in 2006 at Lincoln and Mead. In the field, phenotypic data were collected for grain yield (GY), spike/square meter (SPSM), kernels/spike (KPS), grain volume weight (GVWT), 1000-kernel weight (TKW), plant height (PH), and heading date (HD), as described by Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell1">[10]</xref>. The data on <italic>Pseudocercosporella</italic> induced lodging (<italic>Ps</italic>IL), also known as eyespot or strabreaker foot rot, was recorded on an arbitrary scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 represents &lt;10% lodging and 10 represents complete lodging) at Pullman in 2008. The disease is caused by <italic>P. herpotrichoides</italic> (Fron.) Deighton, which results in weakening of the stem base eventually leading to the lodging of the infested plants. Briefly, each entry was grown in a four-row plot of 2.4 m length and 30 cm row-spacing with four replications following a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in 1999, 2005&#x2013;2007, and 2008, and following incomplete block design (ICBD) in 2000 and 2001. In 2005 Lincoln trial, data were not recorded on GY, SPSM, KPS and TKW because the field was infested with the soil borne wheat mosaic virus. Similarly in 2008, data could only be recorded for plant height and <italic>Ps</italic>IL.</p>
        <p>For the greenhouse study, seeds of the 95 RICLs along with parents were planted in vermiculite medium and seedlings at the two-leaf stage were vernalized at 4&#xB0;C for eight weeks. Subsequently, these seedlings were transplanted in plastic pots each lined with polyethylene bags containing two-kg of acid-washed course sand. For drainage small holes were punched in the polyethylene bags. Each pot was supplied with 250 ml of Hoagland solution adjusted to pH 5.7 per day to meet the nutritional and water requirements of plants throughout the study. The plants in the greenhouse were grown at the day/night temperatures of 25/18&#xB0;C with 16 hrs of supplemental light. The study was conducted using a randomized complete block design with three replications of each entry. Data on various phenotypic traits were recorded at different developmental stages. Plant height (PH) was recorded in cm by measuring the tallest tiller from ground to the tip of the spike excluding awns, heading date (HD) was measured in number of days from sowing to emergence of at least three spikes from the leaves. The 1000-kernel weight (TKW) in grams (g) was computed from the weight of all kernels harvested per plant. Data on total number of kernels per plant, their weight, and total number of spikes per plant were used to calculate kernels per spike (KPS). Seed weight per spike (SWPS) was calculated by dividing total seed weight by total number of spikes.</p>
        <p>For biomass related traits, each plant was harvested at maturity and dissected into three parts: roots, spikes, and everything else. The plant material was dried at 50&#xB0;C for three days before recording weight. Shoot biomass (SB) included weight of all above ground plant parts excluding roots. For root biomass (RB), the below ground plant parts with sand were placed on a sieve of an appropriate mesh size that allowed collection of roots without sand particles. The total biomass was calculated from the sum of root and shoot biomass recorded for each plant. One-way analysis of variance was performed and the least significant difference (P&lt;0.05) was used to partition significant difference in means of various traits. All statistics were performed using SAS statistical software version 8.1 (SAS Institute, North Carolina).</p>

        <title>Greenhouse Evaluation of Traits</title>
        <p>In view of accessing reliability and the applied value of phenotypic measurements made on the complex traits under the controlled environment, and to evaluate 95 RICLs 3A-population for plant biomass-related traits, data were recorded on the following traits: RB, SB, TB, PH, HD, TKW, SWPS and KPS. The one-way ANOVA, trait correlations, and subsequently QTL analyses were then conducted.</p>
        <p>The results of one-way ANOVA suggested that RICLs were significantly different for all studied traits with a P value of &lt;0.001 to 0.05. The only exception in the greenhouse was TKW, which was not significantly different (P value&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.05). The coefficient of variation (CV), which was used to measure reliability index for various traits, ranged from 4.5 for HD to 29.3% for RB. The traits other than HD that had CV values less than 10% are PH and TKW. The CVs for the remaining traits were close to 15%. Our previous results showed that the traits with CV &lt;15% can be used reliably for genetic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell1">[10]</xref>. Most of the traits scored in this study had CV values &lt;15% with an exception of RB that had 29% CV. The high CV value for RB makes it difficult to characterize this trait, and can be attributed to the loss of root biomass due to microbial oxidation during the later stages of the experiment, although the extent of microbial activities are expected to be minimum under the sand culture. This suggests that the sand culture method is an efficient way of keeping the environmental variations to minimum for most of the studied traits (except for RB), thus can be used to record complex biological traits.</p>
        <p>When correlations were studied among traits, shoot biomass showed positive correlations with all traits except KPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s005">table S2</xref>). In comparison with CNN a reduction in root and shoot biomass of CNN(WI3A) was observed, although differences between WI and CNN were non-significant.

        <title>Integrated Genetic Linkage Map</title>

In the present study, we report development of two genetic linkage maps. The map using the same set of 95 RICLs has 81 molecular markers including 31 SSRs, 1 STM, 25 RFLPs and 24 DArT markers. Another map with 41 molecular markers, including 32 SSRs and 9 RFLPs, was developed using an extended set of 223 RICLs - consisting of 95 previously used and 128 newly developed lines (for details, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Ali1">[12]</xref>). The polymorphism survey of the two parents of the RICL-3A population with 90 chromosome 3A-specific SSRs identified 31 (34.4% polymorphism) polymorphic markers. Similar analysis of 20 STMs identified only one (5% polymorphism) polymorphic marker. Polymorphism analysis using wheat <italic>Pst</italic>I (<italic>Taq</italic>I) v2.6 discovery DArT array identified 56 (36.3%) of the 154 3A specific markers to be polymorphic between the two parents. These results showed that both DArT and SSR markers were equally efficient in detecting polymorphism in wheat whereas STMs were significantly less efficient. Testing of 142 RFLP markers for polymorphism identified 29 (20.42%) polymorphic markers with 11 restriction enzymes.</p>
        <p>The map with 81 markers was prepared by using the previously mapped 25 RFLPs (excluding <italic>Xfba347</italic>) and 14 SSRs (excluding <italic>Xwmc264</italic>) as anchors to assign newly identified 74 polymorphic markers.

        <p>Of the 81 markers, six (<italic>Xbarc310</italic>, <italic>Xbarc321</italic>, <italic>Xbarc57</italic>, <italic>Xbarc12</italic>, <italic>Xwmc11</italic>, and <italic>Xwmc532</italic>) showed distorted segregation, skewed in favor of the CNN(WI3A) parent. All of these markers are present at the tip of the short arm suggesting that the distal end of the short arm from WI transmits preferentially over that from CNN. Another explanation for this distorted segregation could be the presence of the earliness QTL in the region and unintentional selection of lines based on their maturity times during the RICL development process.</p>
        <p>Both the RFLP and SSR markers were uniformly distributed throughout the map, however, the DArT markers showed severe clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Marone1">[29]</xref>. The DArT markers formed three clusters on the 3A map with many of the markers showed perfect or tight linkage suggesting that either these markers represent the same locus or are very tightly linked. For all practical purposes, the mapped DArT markers in this study served as three unique loci. Clustering of the DArT markers with no interspersion with the other marker types suggested that these markers might actually be representing part of the genome different from that represented by RFLPs and SSRs. If not all, most of the RFLP markers represent the genic fraction of the wheat genome and the SSRs were interspersed with the RFLP markers. Furthermore, very few of the DArT markers showed associations with any of the QTLs identified in this or the previous studies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that although DArT markers showed high-level of polymorphism they generated redundant information and most likely represented repetitive fraction of the genome, thus are less applicable for gene mapping studies.</p>
        <p>In general, the order of the markers on the current map is in conformity with that on the maps developed by Somers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Somers1">[30]</xref> and Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Song1">[31]</xref>. Except for the DArT markers, distribution of other markers is uniform. There were five regions with genetic distance longer than 16 cM. These regions could either represent highly recombinogenic regions or regions with low polymorphism between the two parents. Although low levels of nucleotide diversity in the proximal regions of chromosome 3A has been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Akhunov1">[32]</xref>, it appears to be a less likely explanation because the five regions with more than 16 cM genetic distances were present in the distal halves of the chromosome. As the distal chromosomal regions have been shown to be highly recombinogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Erayman1">[13]</xref>, longer than 16 cM genetic distance in the five regions can thus be attributed to higher recombination rates.</p>

          <p>QTL analysis of the field data collected over 13 environments and of data pooled over environments for the years 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006, allowed identification of four QTLs for HD. Out of these four QTLs, two QTLs (<italic>wPt3041-wPt4868</italic> and <italic>Xbg27413-Xtam055</italic>) were consistently detected over two environments, whereas the remaining QTLs were detected in a single environment each. The LOD scores ranged from 2.4 to 3.2 and PVE ranged from 9.64% to 14.11%. The distribution of phenotypic data for HD was bimodal. In an earlier study, performed using the same mapping population, the phenotypic data recorded on HD was treated as a qualitative trait and assigned to chromosome arm 3AS as <italic>earliness per se</italic> (<italic>Eps</italic>) locus distal to a RFLP marker <italic>Xcdo549</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Shah2">[9]</xref>. Presence of an earliness locus on chromosome 3A was also reported in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Berke1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Hoogendoorn1">[34]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Miura1">[36]</xref>.

Although, <italic>Xcdo549</italic> and <italic>Xtam055</italic> (flanking two HD QTLs) are separated by a long genetic distance of 68.6 cM on the linkage map both markers were localized to the same deletion bin, 3AS-3 FL 0.71 (size 102.95 Mb) on the physical map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>). Another marker (<italic>Xbarc45</italic>), from the same deletion bin that contains QTLs for HD and the <italic>Eps</italic> locus, was recently shown to be associated with days to ear emergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Griffiths1">[37]</xref> and seems to correspond with the HD QTLs detected during the present study.

          <p>In case of PH, 17 QTLs were detected in 19 different environments (including pooled environments for the years 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006); the LOD scores ranged from 2.3 to 8.1 and PVE ranged from 7.64% to 24.43%.

          <title>(iii) Grain Yield (GY)</title>
          <p>Eleven QTLs were detected in 16 different environments including pooled data for the years 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006. The LOD scores of the QTLs ranged from 2.5 to 9.6 and PVE ranged from 9.36% to 33.98% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070526-t001">table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>). Five of these QTLs were consistently detected in two to six of the studied environments. All QTLs showed positive additive effects with WI alleles favoring higher grain yield. In earlier studies conducted using the same mapping population, QTLs for grain yield were localized to overlapping marker intervals (<italic>Xbarc86-Xwmc388.1</italic>, <italic>Xcdo638-Xbarc67</italic>, <italic>Xmc664-Xbarc67</italic> and <italic>Xstm6352-Xwmc428</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell1">[10]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Ali1">[12]</xref>. In the present study, the yield QTLs mapped to the same regions but to narrower marker intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s001">figure S1</xref>). These results clearly showed that major QTL for grain yield exist both in the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of 3AS. Compared to earlier studies using the same mapping population, we detected a higher number of grain yield QTLs. This result can be attributed to the increase in marker density in the present genetic map, which might have resulted in partitioning of the effect to the adjacent marker intervals leading to identification of many more QTLs in consecutive marker intervals with lower LOD scores and PVE values.</p>

          <title>(iv) Grain Volume Weight (GVWT)</title>
          <p>The grain volume weight or test weight is an important trait as it is associated with the flour yield during wheat milling. Across all environments, the substitution line CNN(WI3A) showed a higher GVWT compared to CNN, however the variation was statistically non-significant. Fifteen QTLs were detected for GVWT in 15 of the 17 environments (including pooled data for the years 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006). LOD scores for the QTLs ranged from 2.3 to 6.6 and PVE ranged from 7.05% to 28.53% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070526-t002">table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>). Out of the 15 QTLs, 11 were detected in two or more environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s007">table S4</xref>). Twelve of the 15 QTLs showed positive additive effects and the remaining showed negative additive effects suggesting that the two parents have complimentary genes/alleles for GVWT. All four major chromosomal regions associated with the GVWT using an extended set of 223 RICLs were also identified in the present study along with the detection of some additional QTLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Ali1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s001">figure S1</xref>). These results highlight the value of increasing marker density in QTL analysis. The previous study, although conducted on a larger population, had 32 markers compared to 81 in the present study. The GVWT QTL in marker interval <italic>Xbarc19</italic>-<italic>Xcfa2262</italic> coincided with the previously detected meta-QTLs one each for grain width and grain length/width localized to the marker interval <italic>Xcfa2262-Xbcd366</italic>

          <p>Altogether 11 QTLs were detected for TKW in 10 of the 16 environments (including pooled data for the years 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006) with the LOD scores ranging from 2.3 to 5.6 and PVE from 9.31% to 26.82%. Six of these QTLs were consistent over environments. Seven QTLs showed negative additive effects and four showed positive additive effects. A majority of the QTLs carried favorable alleles from CNN, whereas the favorable alleles for the remaining QTLs were contributed by WI.

        <title>Comparison of QTL Analyses Conducted on Field and Greenhouse Data</title>
        <p>An objective of this study was to compare quantitative trait data collected in the field with that collected in a greenhouse especially to reliably score traits with low heritability. Our results suggested that the greenhouse data showed less variability in comparison with the field data and also lead to the identification of significantly fewer QTLs in comparison with the field data. For instance, the QTL analysis for four common traits (HD, PH, KPS and TKW) using greenhouse data resulted in the identification of a total of five QTLs, one each for HD, KPS and TKW, and two QTLs for PH. Whereas 52 QTLs were detected using field data collected over multiple environment (including pooled environments). A major reason for identifying fewer QTLs in the greenhouse compared to the field data is due to minimization of genotype &#xD7; environment and QTL &#xD7; environment interactions, which have been earlier documented for chromosome 3A using the field data recorded on the same mapping population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Dhungana1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Campbell2">[45]</xref>. A less likely explanation for the large number of QTLs detected using the multi-environment field data is due to identification of false positives at &#x2264;5% error rate, which can be easily avoided by looking only at the consistent QTLs.</p>
        <p>For HD a unique negative effect QTL (<italic>wPt_2698-wPt_2740</italic>) with a LOD score of 3.2 and PVE of 18.36% was detected from the greenhouse data analysis. Similarly a unique QTL each for TKW and KPS respectively in the marker intervals <italic>Xgwm218-Xbf20313</italic> and <italic>Xwmc664-Xbarc67</italic> was detected from the greenhouse data analysis. Both of these QTLs have negative additive effects, and LOD scores and PVE values comparable to the QTLs detected from the field data analysis. These QTLs however were not detected in the field data analysis performed in the present study, but were consistently detected in the earlier studies performed on the same population or other populations (see above). These results could be explained by the fact that increase in marker density on the genetic linkage map may allow partitioning of the effect to the adjoining marker intervals often making it un-detectable under the defined parameters. In addition, the two QTLs detected for PH were both consistently detected in field as well as greenhouse data analyses. The PVE values and the LOD scores of the QTLs detected from the greenhouse data were comparable to the mean of LOD scores and PVE values for the similar QTLs identified from multi-environment field data analysis. Thus, it is apparent from the present analysis that the greenhouse data can complement the field data to study low heritability traits, and is a valuable resource to reliably dissect quantitative traits with limited investment of time and money.</p>

        <title>Comparative Mapping and Identification of Candidate Genes</title>
        <p>To demarcate rice genomic regions corresponding with the QTLs for GY and other agronomic traits present on wheat chromosome arm 3AS, DNA sequences of 36 (51.43%) of the 70 DNA markers were compared with the rice genomic DNA sequences using various &#x2018;BLAST&#x2019; functions. The remaining 34 DNA markers were not used for the analysis as their sequences were not publicly available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s004">table S1</xref>). Of the 36 sequences, 20 (55.56%) detected a high level of sequence homology (e-value &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;20</sup> to 0.0) with the rice genomic DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s004">table S1</xref>). The remaining 16 (44.44%) sequences, however, did not identify any ortholog in the rice genome. Sequences corresponding to 3 (15%) of the 20 sequences were present in more than one copy in the rice genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s004">table S1</xref>). The wheat chromosome arm 3AS showed maximum homology to rice chromosome 1, as 16 of the 20 (80%) sequences identified their orthologs on rice chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s004">table S1</xref>). Homologues for the remaining 4 of the 20 wheat sequences were present on 4 other rice chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s004">table S1</xref>). Distribution of the 16 wheat sequences on rice chromosome 1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>. The collinear region identified on the rice chromosome 1 spans all major QTLs for yield and other agronomic traits, identified on 3AS.</p>
        <p>It is generally difficult to align QTL harboring regions across genera, but due to relatively extensive genome conservation among cereals, it is possible to superimpose QTLs identified among genus. To achieve this objective, the rice genomic DNA sequence was used as surrogate where flanking markers of rice and wheat QTLs were placed to determine correspondence among QTLs for related traits. In some instances, due to lack of sequence information, other associated markers selected on the basis of present/previous mapping information and/or markers mapping to the same deletion bin were used for this purpose. For instance, markers associated with the two HD QTLs identified on 3AS in the present study showed correspondence with a region on rice chromosome 1 carrying a flowering time QTL, <italic>dth1.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s002">figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Thomson1">[46]</xref>. Similarly, the evolutionarily conserved regions influencing grain yield on short arm of rice chromosome 1 detected in a number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Xing1">[3]</xref> corresponded well with the wheat grain yield QTLs, giving new insight into the domestication history of the cereals. A chromosomal region flanked by <italic>Xhbg491</italic> and <italic>wPt-2698</italic>, harboring QTLs for TKW, GVWT and SPSM in the present study corresponded with the region harboring QTLs for grain weight, tiller number and grain yield in proximity of the Lax1 gene in rice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s002">figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Xing1">[3]</xref>. Similarly, QTLs for tillers per plant detected on both long and short arms of rice chromosome 1 corresponded with the QTLs for SPSM (in wheat spikes/m2 represents tillers/m2) in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Xing1">[3]</xref>. Co-localizing QTLs for primary, secondary branch number, and panicle weight in rice were reported in chromosome region, which corresponds with the region (<italic>wPt-3041-wPt-1464</italic>), where QTL for KPS was detected in the present study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Wang2">[47]</xref>. In general, our data suggested high correspondence in the QTL harboring regions in rice and wheat, which might be a consequence of selection for similar traits during the domestication process of different cereals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Gepts1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>With the objective to identify candidate genes (CGs) and to increase marker density in the regions underlying the QTLs of interest, we studied the gene-content of rice BAC/PAC clones spanning the regions underlying QTLs, annotated each gene and compared identified genes with the wheat ESTs. We also placed 94 yield-contributing genes so far cloned from cereals on the rice genomic DNA sequence (data shown for only rice chromosome 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s002">figure S2</xref>) and determined the location of those sequences that underlie yield QTLs on 3AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>). Genomic locations of two of these candidate genes (<italic>CKX2</italic> and <italic>GID2-like</italic>) were also confirmed by HRM melt curve analysis and PAGE using gene-specific STS (sequence tagged site) primers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Mameaux1">[49]</xref> on wheat aneuploid stocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>). To align the region harboring QTL(s) for grain yield with the BAC-contig of 3B and to increase the marker density in this region, the rice BAC/PAC sequences spanning this region were also compared against BAC end sequences derived from chromosome 3B and 3AS specific BAC libraries. The analysis allowed identification of BAC-end sequences that align with the corresponding region of BAC scaffold assembled for chromosome 3B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s003">figure S3</xref>). The identified BAC-end sequences were used for the development of STS or sequence tagged microsatellite site (STMS) markers that are currently being used for the development of high-resolution maps of the specific regions (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Deletion Based Physical Mapping</title>
        <p>Since recombination is highly uneven on wheat chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Erayman1">[13]</xref>, it is very important to know the physical location of genes/QTLs before any further characterization is done. Keeping this in mind, the physical location of QTLs was determined by comparing the deletion line-based physical map with the integrated genetic linkage map of chromosome 3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g002">figure 2</xref>). Comparison of genetic and physical maps has shown detailed distribution of recombination on wheat chromosomes and has shown hot and cold spots of recombination along the length of chromosome 3A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0070526-Erayman1">[13]</xref>. The QTLs for grain yield present in the marker intervals <italic>Xcdo549-Xbarc310</italic> and <italic>Xpsp3047-Xbarc356</italic> reside in the high-recombination regions. In comparison, the region containing QTLs for SWPS, KPS, <italic>Ps</italic>IL and SPSM, which are flanked by markers <italic>Xwmc664</italic> and <italic>Xwmc489,</italic> has a low level of recombination. This makes the <italic>Xwmc664</italic> and <italic>Xwmc489</italic> QTL interval less amenable to map-based cloning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070526-g001">figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To increase the utility of the current genetic linkage map, we aligned the current map with other available genetic maps of chromosome 3A, and assembled a composite genetic map using the CMap function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070526.s001">figure S1</xref>). This composite map when aligned with other genetic maps for chromosome 3A, allowed placement of QTLs for a variety of agronomic and quality traits mapped in other mapping populations, on our map. Specifically QTLs for dough score (Dsc), bread score (Bsc), dough strength (W), bread loaf volume (Bvol), grain protein content (GPC), <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight (FHB) resistance, grain color and preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance were placed. This analysis gave a broader view of genes mapping to chromosome 3A.</p>

        <title>Perspective</title>
        <p>The present study describes comprehensive genetic and physical maps of wheat chromosome 3A and their use in demarcating chromosomal regions harboring genes/QTLs influencing agronomically important traits. Comparison of a high-density genetic linkage map with the integrated physical map of chromosome 3A led to identification of chromosomal regions carrying cluster of coinciding QTLs for various agronomically important traits. Rice-wheat synteny allowed identification of candidate genes (CGs) underlying some of the QTL-clusters.
