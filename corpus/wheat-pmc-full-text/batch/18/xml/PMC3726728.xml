      <abstract>
        <p>Calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) have been found to be responsive to abiotic stress. However, their precise functions and the related molecular mechanisms in abiotic stress tolerance are not completely understood, especially in wheat. In the present study, <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> was identified as a new member of <italic>CIPK</italic> gene family in wheat. <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> transcript increased after NaCl, cold, methyl viologen (MV), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene treatments. Over-expression of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> in tobacco resulted in increased salt tolerance, which was demonstrated by higher germination rates, longer root lengths and better growth status of transgenic tobacco plants compared to controls when both were treated with salt stress. Physiological measurements indicated that transgenic tobacco seedlings retained high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratios and Ca<sup>2+</sup> content by up-regulating some transporter genes expression and also possessed lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and reduced membrane injury by increasing the expression and activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) under salt stress. Moreover, transgenic lines conferred tolerance to oxidative stress by increasing the activity and expression of CAT. Finally, TaCIPK29 was located throughout cells and it preferentially interacted with TaCBL2, TaCBL3, NtCBL2, NtCBL3 and NtCAT1. Taken together, our results showed that <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> functions as a positive factor under salt stress and is involved in regulating cations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Soil salinity, as a severe abiotic stress factor, limits the growth of most plant species and can cause significant losses in crop yield. Salt stress can affect photosynthesis, growth, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-RuizLozano1">[1]</xref>. However, plants develop a variety of sophisticated mechanisms to protect themselves from salt stress. The major factors of plant responses to salt stress include perception and transduction of stress signals.</p>
      <p>Calcium, as a second messenger, plays an important role in various signal transduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Asano1">[2]</xref>. Several classes of calcium-sensing proteins, including calmodulin (CaM), calmodulin-like (CML), calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), have been identified in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Franz1">[3]</xref>. Calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) belong to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated CBL-CIPK network in response to stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Xiang1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Zhao1">[7]</xref>. Genome-wide analysis has identified 26 <italic>CIPKs</italic> in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Kolukisaoglu1">[8]</xref>, 33 <italic>CIPKs</italic> in rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Piao1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Kolukisaoglu1">[8]</xref>, 27 <italic>CIPKs</italic> in poplar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Yu1">[9]</xref> and 43 <italic>CIPKs</italic> in maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Chen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In plants, several CIPKs have been reported to be involved in salt stress responses. Notably, the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways in salinity signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Qiu1">[11]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Tang1">[14]</xref>. AtCIPK24/AtSOS2 can interact with AtCBL4/AtSOS3 to function on the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, AtSOS1/AtNHX7, enhancing salt stress tolerance in roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Kudla1">[15]</xref>, whereas the AtCBL10-AtCIPK24 complex protects the shoot tissue from salt stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Quan1">[16]</xref>. AtCIPK24/AtSOS2 has also been found to interact with nucleoside triphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2) as well as AtCAT2/AtCAT3, which are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and scavenging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Verslues1">[17]</xref>. This evidence indicated that AtCIPK24/AtSOS2 is a crucial regulator in the salt stress signaling network, which can mediate both Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and the oxidative stress response. Most of the <italic>CIPK</italic> genes enhancing salt tolerance are similar to <italic>AtCIPK24/AtSOS2</italic> such as <italic>MdSOS2, MdCIPK6L</italic> and <italic>ZmCIPK16</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Zhao1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Hu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Wang1">[19]</xref>. Meanwhile, <italic>AtCIPK6</italic>, <italic>AtCIPK9</italic>, <italic>HbCIPK2</italic>, <italic>SlSOS2</italic> and <italic>AtCIPK23</italic> have been reported to be involved in K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, in which <italic>AtCIPK6</italic> and <italic>AtCIPK23</italic> can increase the activity of the plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> transporter such as AKT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Li1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Lee1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Lan1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Pandey1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Huertas1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to understand whether wheat CIPKs can regulate K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and ROS scavenging under salt stress. In addition, the interaction between CBLs and CIPKs in wheat is yet to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Internationally, wheat production is affected by many environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity and extreme temperatures. Genetic improvement of stress resistance in wheat is highly desired and understanding the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress responses is therefore necessary. <italic>CIPK</italic> genes play an important role in regulating abiotic stress tolerance in plants. In comparison to other species, however, little is known about <italic>CIPKs</italic> in wheat. Only one <italic>CIPK</italic> gene, <italic>WPK4,</italic> has been characterized in wheat, which is involved in light, nutrient deprivation and cytokinin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Sano1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Ikeda1">[25]</xref>. The main function of the CBL-CIPK network in response to abiotic stress has not been characterized in wheat. In this work, we reported a wheat <italic>CIPK</italic> gene <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> that conferred salt tolerance not only by improving the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratios and Ca<sup>2+</sup> content but also by decreasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and membrane damage.</p>

        <title>Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the Full-length <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> cDNA</title>
        <p>To obtain salt stress responsive <italic>CIPK</italic> genes in wheat, we referred to the highly similar orthologs in rice. Twelve rice <italic>CIPKs</italic> (<italic>OsCIPK7</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK8</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK9</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK10</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK11</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK15</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK16</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK17</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK21</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK22</italic>, <italic>OsCIPK29</italic> and <italic>OsCIPK30</italic>) were reported to be up-regulated by salt stress, whereas only <italic>OsCIPK15</italic> was further studied for salt tolerance in rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Zhu2">[26]</xref>. Then, we performed TBLASTN analysis in the DFCI database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/">http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/</ext-link>) using salt-induced rice CIPK protein sequences and found several wheat tentative consensuses (TCs) of these rice <italic>CIPK</italic> genes (data not shown). Among the wheat CIPK-like TCs, TC371359, which shared 86% similarity and 79% identity with OsCIPK29 in amino acids, encodes a peptide of 306 amino acids that lacked more than 100 amino acid residues in the N-terminal. Importantly, this TC371359 consisted of six expressed sequence tags (ESTs), in which BQ753202 was identified from a salt-stressed root cDNA library (TA065E1X) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Sorrells1">[27]</xref>. These data indicated that TC371359 might be a salt stress responsive <italic>CIPK</italic> gene in wheat.</p>
        <p>Employing the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, we successfully amplified the full-length cDNA designated as <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> (accession no. JX243013). The obtained cDNA of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> was 1862 bp with an ORF of 1311 bp. The TaCIPK29 protein consists of 436 amino acid residues with a predicted relative molecular mass of 47.4 kDa. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that the deduced TaCIPK29 protein contained an N-terminal highly conserved kinase domain, the FISL domain and the PPI domain located in the C-terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-SanchezBarrena1">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069881.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of TaCIPK29 with other CIPKs from Arabidopsis, tobacco, rice and barley indicated that TaCIPK29 was close to OsCIPK29, HvCIPK29, AtCIPK14 and NtCIPK14 in the intron-less subgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069881.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). To confirm whether <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> contained an intron in the wheat genome, we cloned <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> by using cDNA and the genomic DNA of wheat as template. The resulted sequences showed <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> harbored no intron (data not shown). These results indicated that <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> obtained in this study is a member of the <italic>CIPK</italic> family in wheat.</p>

        <p>To assess the expression of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> in various wheat tissues, mRNAs were isolated from different tissues of wheat including root, stem, leaf, stamen, pistil and lemma.

        <p>To determine the response of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> to abiotic stress, wheat leaves were sampled to determine <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> transcript levels after PEG6000, NaCl, low temperature and MV treatment. The results suggested that the transcript of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> was strongly up-regulated by low temperature and MV treatment, marginally induced by NaCl treatment and inhibited by PEG6000 treatment in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069881-g001">Figs. 1B, 1C, 1F and 1G</xref>). To further confirm the upregulation of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> under NaCl treatment, qRT-PCR was performed with wheat roots and stems as samples.

        <p>To further detect the function of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> in abiotic stress tolerance, transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> under the control of the <italic>Cauli&#xFB02;ower Mosaic Virus</italic> (CaMV) 35S promoter were generated. A total of 18 transgenic lines (T<sub>1</sub>) were identified by kanamycin-resistant and PCR analysis using primers specific to <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> and the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene (data not shown). Among the T<sub>1</sub> lines, three (OE-1, OE-3 and OE-4) exhibited a ratios of &#x223C;3&#x2236;1 segregation on the basis of kanamycin resistance. Moreover, seedlings from all three transgenic T<sub>2</sub> lines grew well on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 150 mg/L of kanamycin. In addition, tobacco plants transformed with empty vector alone were also subjected to similar analysis. Expression of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> was also determined by RT-PCR, which indicated that <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> mRNA was present in all three transgenic lines but not in the vector control (VC) lines and wild-type (WT).

        <p>Because Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> were involved in cell metabolism, enzyme activation and protein biosynthesis, activities of antioxidantive enzymes such as catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) and peroxidase (POD; EC 1.11.1.7) were detected under normal conditions and salt treatment.

        <p>To further understand the regulating mechanism of TaCIPK29, yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed. TaCIPK29 was fused to the activation domain vector (pGADT7) as prey, whereas the TaCBLs were fused to the binding domain vector (pGBKT7) as bait. The yeast cells co-transformed with the AD-TaCIPK29 and distinct BD vectors were spared in the selective medium TDO/X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069881-g010">Figs. 10A and 10B</xref>). The results showed that TaCIPK29 could interact with TaCBL1, TaCBL2, TaCBL3 and TaCBL4, but very weakly with TaCBL6 and TaCBL7. In addition, 3-ami-notriazole (3-AT), as an inhibitor of His synthetase, was often used to identify the strong interaction through inhibiting the weak interaction of the pray and the bait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069881-Hamada1">[33]</xref>. When we supplied the selective medium with 10 mM 3-AT and 20 &#xB5;M X-&#x3B1;-gal, we found that only the yeast cell with the AD-TaCIPK29 and BD-TaCBL2 or AD-TaCIPK29 and BD-TaCBL3 grew and exhibited blue color. The results suggested that TaCIPK29 had strong interactions with TaCBL2 and TaCBL3. Furthermore, NtCBL2 and NtCBL3 shared high similarity with TaCBL2 and TaCBL3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069881.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) were also cloned and introduced into the BD vector, and showed their capability to interact with TaCIPK29 in the yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069881-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Because the expression of <italic>NtPOX2</italic> and <italic>NtCAT1</italic> was higher in <italic>TaCIPK29</italic>-overexpressing tobacco plants than that in the controls (WT and VC) under salt stress, NtPOX2 and NtCAT1 were also introduced into BD vector to detect their interaction with TaCIPK29. The results indicated that there were no interactions between TaCIPK29 and NtPOX2, whereas TaCIPK29 could interact with NtCAT1 (sharing high similarity with AtCAT2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069881-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). The interactions between TaCIPK29 and NtSOS1/NtNHX2/NtNHX4/NtCAX3 were not conducted because of the lack of complete sequences for the four tobacco genes. These results suggested TaCIPK29 interacted with NtCAT1 and CBL2/CBL3 preferentially.</p>

The interactions between TaCIPK29 and TaCBLs/NtCBLs/NtCAT1/NtPOX2 were examined in the triple dropout medium containing 20 &#xB5;g/ml X-&#x3B1;-gal (SD/&#x2212;His/&#x2212;Leu/&#x2212;Trp plus X-&#x3B1;-gal, TDOX) or TDOX adding 10 mM 3-AT (A). The interaction between SV40 large T-antigen (AD-T) and murine p53 (BD-53) used as positive control and the interaction between SV40 large T-antigen and human lamin C (BD-Lam) used as negative control were tested on the same TDOX medium and TDOX medium containing 10 mM 3-AT (B). Two-week-old wheat and tobacco seedlings were treated with 200 mM NaCl to detect the expression of CBLs (C). Three different experiments were performed with similar results.</p>

The coding sequences of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> and different candidate genes were amplified by PCR with specific primers (P8, P16, P17, P19, P20, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069881.s006">Table S1</xref>) harboring restriction sites were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid pGADT7 vector (prey) and the pGBKT7 vector (bait), respectively. The yeast strain Y2HGold was co-transformed with pAD-TaCIPK29 and each pBD (TaCBL1, TaCBL2, TaCBL3, TaCBL4, TaCBL6, TaCBL7 and TaCBL9 as well as NtCBL2, NtCBL3, NtCAT1 and NtPOX2) with the lithium acetate method according to the protocol (Clontech). The co-transformants were screened on triple dropout medium (TDO/X medium, SD/&#x2212;His/&#x2212;Leu/&#x2212;Trp/X-&#x3B1;-gal) without 3-ami-notriazole (3-AT) and with 10 mM 3-AT, respectively. All the yeast two-hybrid studies were performed in triplicate.</p>

        <title>Subcellular Localization Assay</title>
        <p>The recombinant plasmid pBI121<italic>-TaCIPK29-GFP</italic> was constructed containing the coding sequence of <italic>TaCIPK29</italic> (P9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069881.s006">Table S1</xref>) with a <italic>Xba</italic>I/<italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction site and was used for a sublocalization assay. The pBI121<italic>-TaCIPK29-GFP</italic> and pBI121-<italic>GFP</italic> were transferred into onion epidermal cells by using gene gun bombardment (PDS-1000, BIO-RAD). Fluorescence was examined by a microscope (OLYMPUS IX71, Japan) after 24 h incubation. The fluorescence in onion epidermal cells after plasmolysis induced by 50% sucrose was also recorded. To confirm the localization of TaCIPK29 in the plasma membrane (PM), the PM marker (PM-RK) was applied.</p>

        <title>Stress Tolerance Analysis of the VC, WT and Transgenic Lines</title>
        <p>Tobacco seeds (about 200) were surface-sterilized and germinated on MS medium containing different concentrations of NaCl (0 mM, 150 mM or 200 mM) in the incubator (25<sup>o</sup>C) for 12 d and then the germination rate was assessed. For root length assessment, the two controls and transgenic lines grown on MS without NaCl for one week were transferred to MS or MS with 150 mM and 200 mM NaCl for one week in the vertical position. For phenotype assay under salt stress, the sterilized seeds were sown in MS medium and grown for one week and then transferred to the soil container for another three weeks of growth. Then, the four-week-old tobacco seedlings were exposed to 300 mM NaCl for 20 d and 25 d salt stress, and the plants were subsequently recovered for 5 d. For oxidative stress assay, the sterilized seeds germinated on MS medium with 10 &#xB5;M MV for two weeks. The sterilized seeds grew on MS medium for two weeks and then the seedlings were transferred to MS plates containing 30 &#xB5;M MV for one week. Five-week-old plants in soil were exposed to 30 &#xB5;M MV solution for 15 d and the phenotype was recorded.</p>
