      <abstract>
        <p>Stripe rust, caused by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), is one of the most serious diseases of wheat; therefore, exploring effective resistance-related genes is critical for breeding and studying resistance mechanisms. However, only a few stripe rust resistance genes and defence-related genes have been cloned. Moreover, transgenic wheat with enhanced stripe rust resistance has rarely been reported. Receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are known to be involved in defence and developmental pathways. In this research, a novel <italic>RLP</italic> gene <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was characterized as an important stripe rust defence gene. <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was screened by GeneChip and was found to be induced by <italic>Pst</italic> specifically in the resistant variety. Knock down of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> in the stripe rust-resistant plants resulted in increased susceptibility to <italic>Pst</italic>, and phenolic autofluorogen accumulation at the pathogen&#x2013;host interaction sites, usually correlated with the hypersensitive response, was decreased dramatically. However, when the <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> gene was transformed into the susceptible wheat variety Yangmai158, the transgenic plants showed highly increased resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>, and the hypersensitive response was enhanced at the infection sites. Meanwhile, the expression of pathogenesis-related genes decreased in the <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>-silenced plants and increased in the <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>-overexpressing plants. Thus, it was proposed that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> greatly contributed to the hypersensitive response during the pathogen&#x2013;host interaction. Along with the functional analysis, an evolutionary study of the <italic>TaRLP1</italic> family was performed. Characterization of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> may facilitate breeding for stripe rust resistance and better understanding of the evolution of the <italic>RLP</italic> genes in wheat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Stripe rust, caused by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the world, and China is the largest endemic area (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Utilization of disease-resistant varieties has proved to be the safest, most economical, and effective method to control stripe rust, and resistance gene cloning is vital for the development of resistant varieties. However, a big challenge for resistance breeding is that <italic>Pst</italic> isolates evolved very rapidly, leading to breakdown of widely used resistance genes&#x2014;especially in China where most new destructive epidemics of <italic>Pst</italic> have originated. <italic>Yr10</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Laroche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), <italic>Yr18</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Krattinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and <italic>Yr36</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) are the only stripe rust resistance genes cloned to date. Using the virus-inducing gene silencing (VIGS) approach, <italic>TaRLK-R1</italic>, <italic>-R2</italic>, and <italic>-R3</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), <italic>TaHsp90.2</italic> and <italic>TaHsp90.3</italic> (G.F. <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), <italic>TaDAD2</italic> (X.J. <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), <italic>TaMCA4</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and <italic>TaRab7</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) have been characterized as the genes required for stripe rust resistance. However, no stripe rust resistance-improved transgenic wheat has been developed by using these genes, so their effect in breeding remains unknown. The stripe rust resistance gene <italic>Yr26</italic> located on chromosome 1B was introduced from <italic>Triticum turgitum</italic> cv. &#x3B3;-80 (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and has been widely used as the main gene resource in China since 2003. <italic>Yr26</italic> is a broad-spectrum resistance gene, but, more importantly, <italic>Yr26</italic> shows potential durable resistance. Thus cloning the genes related to stripe rust resistance from <italic>Yr26</italic>-containing wheat should help in understanding the mechanism of its resistance and in developing varieties resistant to stripe rust.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are cell surface receptors which contain an extracellular lecine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic tail (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Kruijt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Several <italic>RLP</italic> genes are known to be involved in plant&#x2013;pathogen interactions. The first identified <italic>RLP</italic> gene was tomato <italic>Cf-9</italic> that mediated resistance against <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), and several other <italic>Cf</italic> resistance genes have also been characterized to be <italic>RLP</italic> genes (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996, 1998</xref>). In tomato, two <italic>Ve</italic> genes involved in plant resistance against vascular wilt and two <italic>LeEix</italic> genes encoding receptors for the fungal elicitor were also reported to encode RLPs (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kawchuk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Ron and Avni, 2004</xref>). In apple, <italic>HcrVf2</italic> conferred resistance to the scab fungus <italic>Venturia inaequalis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Belfanti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, three <italic>RLP</italic> genes were found to be involved in the resistance response, namely <italic>AtRLP52</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ramonell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), <italic>AtRLP30</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and <italic>snc2-1D</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Apart from defence against pathogens, <italic>RLP</italic> genes also play significant roles in plant development. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>TWO MANY MOUTHS</italic> (<italic>TMM</italic>) was shown to be involved in stomatal patterning (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</xref>), while <italic>CLAVATA2</italic> (<italic>CLV2</italic>) and its orthologue <italic>FASCINATED EAR2</italic> in maize were shown to be involved in meristem development (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Taguchi-Shiobara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Some research was also carried out to elucidate the mechanism of RLP-mediated resistance, such as the <italic>Cf</italic>-mediated hypersensitive response (HR) in tomato (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Stulemeijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and the <italic>Vel</italic>-mediated signals in tomato and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Fradin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Due to the availability of genome sequences, many <italic>RLP</italic> genes have been identified from model species: there are 57 predicted <italic>RLP</italic> genes distributed in 33 loci in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and 90 <italic>RLP</italic> genes distributed in 38 loci in rice (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, despite being an important food crop, there have been few investigations of <italic>RLP</italic> genes in wheat. Identification of <italic>RLP</italic> genes is necessary for extensive study and better understanding of their biological functions in wheat. In the present study, an <italic>RLP</italic> gene, <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>, was cloned and characterized as an important gene involved in stripe rust resistance. <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> has a huge potential role in future genetic engineering for development of varieties resistant to stripe rust. Along with <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>, a large <italic>TaRLP1</italic> family was identified, which may facilitate better understanding of the evolution of <italic>RLP</italic> genes in wheat.</p>

Leaves were harvested at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72h post-inoculation (hpi) for RNA isolation. For chemical treatments, 3-week-old seedlings of cv. 92R137 were sprayed with 5mM salicylic acid (SA), 100 &#x3BC;&#x39C; methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 200 &#x3BC;&#x39C; ethylene (ET), or 7mM hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in 0.05% Tween-20 solution, and with 0.05% Tween-20 used as control. Leaves were harvested at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hpi for RNA isolation. Three independent biological replications were performed.</p>

        <title>GeneChip microarray analysis</title>
        <p>The wheat GeneChip (part no. 900515, Affymetrix) was chosen to screen the <italic>Pst</italic> resistance-responsive genes in the <italic>Yr26</italic>-containing materials. Leaves of 2-week-old seedlings of resistant varieties 92R137 and R236 and susceptible Yangmai158 were collected at 0, 12, and 36 hpi with <italic>Pst</italic> CYR32, respectively. In this study, the microarray was used only to screen some genes for the downstream functional analysis, so the hybridization of each sample was not repeated. However, two resistant lines were used to increase the credibility of the screened positive genes, and the near-isogenic lines were used to reduce the interference of the genetic background. The transcript profile of each sample was obtained using genechip hybridization conducted in the National Engineering Center for Biochip in Shanghai, China, according to the Affymetrix technical manual. Six separate comparisons (categories) were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes between different samples, namely &#x2018;R236-12h versus R236-0h&#x2019;, &#x2018;R236-36h versus R236-0h&#x2019;, &#x2018;92R137-12h versus Yangmai158-12h&#x2019;, &#x2018;R236-12h versus Yangmai158-12h&#x2019;, &#x2018;92R137-36h versus Yangmai158-36h&#x2019;, and &#x2018;R236-36h versus Yangmai158-36h&#x2019;. For each category, probe sets were filtered for a fold change threshold of &gt;2.0 and a parametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction at 5% was applied to identify statistically significant differentially expressed probe sets. Only when the signal ratio value was &gt;2 was the corresponding probe regarded as up-regulated.</p>

It was found that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was significantly up-regulated in cv. 92R137 at 12 hpi with <italic>Pst</italic>, and reached a peak at 36 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In another two <italic>Yr26-</italic>containing cultivars, Neimai 9 and Yuanfeng175, <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was also induced by CYR32 and reached a peak at 72 and 36 hpi, respectively. However, no transcript was detected in susceptible Yangmai158. Therefore, <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> may play an important role in resistance to stripe rust fungus, and perhaps take part in the signal transduction mediated by <italic>Yr26</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Plants are exposed to diverse pathogen infection, and various responses are activated to deal with such attacks. Among the complex defence networks, the signal pathways mediated by <italic>RLP</italic> genes have recently been found to be required in the response to pathogen attacks in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato. However, no <italic>RLP</italic> genes have been studied in monocots. Wheat is one of the world&#x2019;s most important crops and is adversely affected by <italic>Pst</italic>. In this study, a <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> gene was isolated from a stripe rust-resistant variety. The putative protein structure of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> indicated that TaRLP1.1 was a typical RLP, and strong evidence suggested that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>, a member of the <italic>RLP</italic> gene family, was involved in the defence response to stripe rust.</p>

        <title>The role of TaRLP1.1 in stripe rust resistance of wheat</title>
        <p><italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was induced in all four tested and genetically diverse <italic>Yr26</italic>-containing resistant wheat varieties after <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation, but not in susceptible cv. Yangmai158. Furthermore, a gene silencing experiment indicated that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was required for the full resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>, while the complementary experiment showed that overexpression of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> could dramatically improve resistance. Histological analysis implied that it had important roles in HR regulation and activation of <italic>PR</italic> genes. The above results indicate that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was involved in the stripe rust resistance.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">SA, JA, and ET are signalling molecules to regulate complex defence responses by inducing PR genes, and the SA signal pathway is generally correlated with biotrophic pathogen defences and HR (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Spoel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In the present study, strong HR could be induced, and the <italic>PR</italic> genes (<italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>PR2</italic>, and <italic>PR5</italic>&#x2014;the marker genes of SA) were up-regulated in the <italic>Yr26</italic>-containing wheat after the biotrophic <italic>Pst</italic> infection; thus the SA pathway probably participated in defence. <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> expression was dominantly induced by exogenous SA; meanwhile, the extent of HR and the expression of <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>PR2</italic>, and <italic>PR5</italic> changed along with the expression abundance of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>. This suggests that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> participated in the SA-mediated signalling pathway in the wheat&#x2013;stripe rust interactions.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">The <italic>Cf</italic> type <italic>RLP</italic> genes were characterized as disease resistance genes (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In the present study, the silencing of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> resulted in decreased resistance of cv. 92R137; however, the level of susceptibility was not as serious as that of the susceptible cv. Yangmai158, Conversely, overexpression of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> increased the resistance of cv. Yangmai158, but not to a level as high as that of cv. 92R137. Thus, gene expression analysis and functional evaluation indicated that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> was a potential downstream factor involved in the <italic>Yr26</italic>-mediated signal pathway. In addition to the signal pathway containing <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic>, there are probably other branches of signal pathways contributing to full resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> mediated by <italic>Yr26</italic>.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">CYR32 is the most frequently identified isolate of <italic>Pst</italic>, accounting for a frequency of 29.6% throughout China. More importantly, with broad virulence and high fitness, CYR32 will probably cause widespread epidemics of stripe rust in the near future (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The identification of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> as a positive regulator of the HR and an enhancer of resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> CYR32 may provide molecular targets for the development of varieties resistant to stripe rust. The spectrum of resistance will be determined in the higher generations of <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> transgenic plants using more <italic>Pst</italic> isolates.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Protein&#x2013;protein interaction cascades are crucial for signalling pathways. Like other resistance proteins, the LRR domain of RLPs is widely involved in disease resistance by binding to pathogen elicitors or other proteins in the plants to activate downstream signals (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Kruijt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The &#x2018;GxxxG&#x2019; conserved motif in the transmembrane regions of <italic>RLP</italic> genes is likely to be involved in protein&#x2013;protein interactions, as found in the study of the <italic>Cf-RLP</italic> genes, and this protein interaction plays a critical role in <italic>RLP</italic> signal transduction from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic space (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Stulemeijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).The binding protein and the mechanism of the resistance mediated by <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> remain to be elucidated. Thus, transgenic plants of TaRLP1.1 fused with a Myc-tag in the C-terminus are being produced to facilitate the search for the interacting proteins of TaRLP1.1.</p>

For <italic>RLP</italic> resistance genes, a similar manner of gene organization was identified in several cases; for example, the <italic>Cf-2</italic> gene cluster in <italic>Lycopersicon</italic> (now <italic>Solanum</italic>) <italic>pimpinellifolium</italic> included three <italic>Hcr2</italic> genes (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), and the <italic>Cf-5</italic> gene cluster in <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> (now <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) var. <italic>cerasiforme</italic> included four members (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 57 <italic>RLP</italic> genes were distributed on 33 loci, and in rice 90 <italic>RLP</italic> genes were distributed on 38 loci (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In the present study, 10 members of <italic>TaRLP1</italic> in resistant cv. 92R137 and eight members in susceptible cv. Yangmai158 were identified, and it was proposed that the <italic>TaRLP1</italic> family clustered on the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">To adapt to the quick evolution of the pathogen, disease resistance genes often undergo dramatic evolution, such as duplication, deletion/insertion, and recombination, to produce new members to recognize the new pathogens. The gene structure and function analysis of <italic>Cf</italic> genes showed that gene duplication and recombination played an important role in the evolution of <italic>RLP</italic> genes. In some cases, the duplicated gene preserved the function of the original genes (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In <italic>L. pimpinellifolium</italic>, <italic>Hcr9</italic> is the product of recombination between <italic>Hcr9-9D</italic> and <italic>Cf-9</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Kruijt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In the <italic>TaRLP1</italic> family, there were identical members shared by the two materials; however, there were also some members specific to the individual materials. Gene duplication, deletion/insertion, and recombination were identified in the gene evolution of the <italic>TaRLP1</italic> family.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Gene clusters are considered to be the outcome of co-evolution of host and pathogen, and different members of a gene cluster may be aimed at different virulent races (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bhullar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In a gene cluster, some members confer resistance to available pathogen races, while others have no identified resistance function and represent a reservoir to deal with new emerging races or producing new genes (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Kruijt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). For example, among the four members in the <italic>Cf-5</italic> family of cherry tomato, <italic>Hcr2-5C</italic> is the only determinant of Avr5 recognition (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In this study, a number of <italic>TaRLP1</italic> members were identified in wheat, but only two and three were expressed in cv. Yangmai158 and 92R137 under the tested conditions, respectively. It will be interesting to study the expression pattern of the other <italic>TaRLP1</italic> genes, and their response to stimuli.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">In conclusion, strong evidence in the present study suggested that <italic>TaRLP1.1</italic> plays an important role in the stripe rust defence response in the monocot wheat. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the <italic>TaRLP1</italic> family was revealed. This work supplied a good gene resource for genetic engineering in wheat breeding.</p>
