      <abstract>
        <p>The phytase activity in food and feedstuffs is an important nutritional parameter. Members of the Triticeae tribe accumulate purple acid phosphatase phytases (PAPhy) during grain filling. This accumulation elevates mature grain phytase activities (MGPA) up to levels between ~650 FTU/kg for barley and 6000 FTU/kg for rye. This is notably more than other cereals. For instance, rice, maize, and oat have MGPAs below 100 FTU/kg. The cloning and characterization of the <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene complement from wheat, barley, rye, einkorn, and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> is reported here. The Triticeae <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes generally consist of a set of paralogues, <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic>, and have been mapped to Triticeae chromosomes 5 and 3, respectively. The promoters share a conserved core but the <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> promoter have acquired a novel <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory element for expression during grain filling while the <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> promoter has maintained the archaic function and drives expression during germination. <italic>Brachypodium</italic> is the only sequenced Poaceae sharing the <italic>PAPhy</italic> duplication. As for the Triticeae, the duplication is reflected in a high MGPA of ~4200 FTU/kg in <italic>Brachypodium</italic>. The sequence conservation of the paralogous loci on <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosomes 1 and 2 does not extend beyond the <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene. The results indicate that a single-gene segmental duplication may have enabled the evolution of high MGPA by creating functional redundancy of the parent <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene. This implies that similar MGPA levels may be out of reach in breeding programs for some Poaceae, e.g. maize and rice, whereas Triticeae breeders should focus on <italic>PAPhy_a</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phytases (<italic>myo</italic>-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolase; EC 3.1.3.8 and EC 3.1.3.26 are defined as phosphatases which can initiate the sequential hydrolysis of the major storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds, phytate (InsP<sub>6</sub>, <italic>myo</italic>-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate). This provides bio-available phosphate, inositol phosphates, and eventually inositol required for a range of cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Brinch-Pedersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Expression or activation of phytase and the concomitant hydrolysis of InsP<sub>6</sub> has been observed during germination in many plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Duff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). The digestive tracts of non-ruminants possess negligible phytase activity and the activity provided by food and feedstuffs is often insufficient for efficient hydrolysis of the InsP<sub>6</sub> content. Unable to be absorbed, InsP<sub>6</sub> is excreted along with chelated cations. InsP<sub>6</sub> is therefore considered the single, most important antinutritional compound for the bioavailability of a range of essential minerals including Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Brinch-Pedersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Endogenous plant phytases can only be beneficial to nutrition if they are present at the stage of consumption. This usually means in the mature seeds. Among cereals, the Triticeae tribe grains exhibits a remarkable high mature grain phytase activity (MGPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Eeckhout and De Paepe, 1994</xref>). Triticeae phytases are have been proven beneficial during bread making and in the digestive tract of pigs and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Pointillart <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Sandberg and Andersson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">T&#xFC;rk <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Indexing MGPA against wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivium</italic> L.; 100%) places barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) at 49%, rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.) at 430% and <italic>triticale</italic> (&#xD7; <italic>Triticosecale</italic>, Wittmack) at 141%. In comparison, the non-Triticeae cereals oat (<italic>Avena sativa</italic> L.), maize (<italic>Zea maize</italic> L.) and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) index at 3.5, 5.7, and 6.0%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Eeckhout and De Paepe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Lucca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Moreover, there is also variation within species, in wheat up to 2-fold differences between cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Ram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The cereal phytase complement has been found to consist of the multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (MINPP) phytases and the purple acid phosphatase phytases (PAPhy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">2011</xref>). For PAPhy, 12 wheat, barley, maize, and rice cDNAs expressed in the grain have been described. In a phylogenetic analysis including 42 plant purple acid phosphatases, the isolated <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes grouped in a single clade (PAP type 1). The wheat and barley PAPhy could further be grouped as PAPhy_a isoforms, predominantly expressed during grain filling and as PAPhy_b isoforms, predominantly expressed during germination. The isoforms can also be distinguished by the C terminal but are otherwise of very similar sequence. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant proteins demonstrated similar enzyme kinetic parameters except for a slightly higher pH optimum for the examined PAPhy_a and a different preference for metal cofactors. The PAPhy_a protein accumulates in the protein storage vacuoles of the aleurone cells in close proximity to the major InsP<sub>6</sub> deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The MINPPs are also present in different isoforms and they are also expressed both during grain development and germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, purification of phytases from wheat bran and dry and germinating barley grains, in hindsight and based on molecular mass and N-terminal amino acid sequence, revealed the PAPhy as the major contributor to the MGPA in wheat and barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Nakano <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Greiner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). This was further substantiated when it was shown that a transformation mediated duplication of the <italic>HvPAPhy_a</italic> gene in barley doubled the MGPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Holme <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The present study addresses the characterization of genes encoding the Triticeae PAPhy and uncovers their evolutionary history towards a high MGPA. Fifteen Triticeae <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes from the five species wheat, barley, rye, einkorn, and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> are cloned. It is demonstrated by chromosomal mapping in wheat and barley that the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes can be assigned to two paralogous loci encoding the PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b isoforms. In rye, the <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> locus has undergone an additional duplication. The promoters responsible for the differentiated expression of the two loci were examined and the evolutionary origin of the paralogues is discussed in the context of the sequenced grasses rice, maize, sorghum, and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> (<italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (L.) P. Beauv).</p>

        <title>Genomic library constructions, screening, and gene cloning</title>
        <p>Genomic libraries of wheat cultivar Skagen and rye cultivar Picasso were generated using the Lambda Fix II/<italic>Xho</italic>I Partial Fill-In Vector Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The initial libraries were estimated to have 2.8&#x2013;7.2 and 4.5&#x2013;11.5-times genome coverage, respectively. The libraries were amplified once on NZY agar at a density of 300 pfu cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Screening probes were labeled with 20 &#x3BC;Ci <sup>32</sup>P using PCR. Probe one was amplified using the forward primer 5&#x2B9;-CTTGAGCCTGG GACGAAGT-3&#x2B9; and the reverse primer 5&#x2B9;-GAGAAGGACCC GCTCTCC-3&#x2B9;. The primers amplified a 479-bp fragment of the <italic>TaPAPhy_b2</italic> cDNA. Probe two was amplified using the forward primer 5&#x2B9;-TGGACCTGCCGGACAC-3&#x2B9;-and the reverse primer 5&#x2B9;-CGAAGGAGCAGGAGTAGCAG-3&#x2B9;, amplifying a 770-bp fragment of the <italic>ScPAPhy_b1</italic> gene.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">For screening, the amplified libraries were plated out on 240&#xD7;240mm NZY agar at a density of 600 pfu cm<sup>&#x2013;2</sup>. Plaque lifts were preformed with Hybond N+ membranes (GE Healthcare) followed by alkaline denaturation and UV crosslinking. Prehybridization (2 hours) and hybridization (overnight) were performed in Church&#x2019;s buffer (0.25M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with 7% SDS and 0.17mg ml<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> salmon sperm DNA) at 65 &#xB0;C. The membranes were washed twice at 65 &#xB0;C and once at room temperature with SSPE buffer. X-ray films were exposed with the membranes at &#x2013;80 &#xB0;C for 2&#x2013;5 days and the film was subsequently developed and analysed. &#x3BB; preparations were performed with the Lambda midi kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Sequencing of the &#x3BB; clones facilitated the design of primers in conserved regions 3&#x2013;400bp upstream of the start codon and 50&#x2013;250bp downstream of the stop codon of the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). PCR was performed using the Herculase II polymerase in a reaction mixture with 6% DMSO (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Amplicons were cloned in the pCR 4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. At least two clones from independent PCR reactions were sequenced.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Inverted PCR was used to extend known sequences in the 5&#x2B9;-direction. The templates were prepared by digestion of cereal genomic DNA with restriction endonucleases, <italic>Bam</italic>HI, <italic>Xho</italic>I, or <italic>Sca</italic>I followed by inactivation of the enzyme and ligation with T4 DNA ligase in a final DNA concentration of 2ng &#x3BC;l<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>. Templates were generated from barley and einkorn genomic DNA. Inverted PCR consisted of a reaction with a primary primer set (5&#x2B9;-GAATTCCAGATGGGCGGC-3&#x2B9; and 5&#x2B9;-CTGCTCGGGAGCCCAG-3&#x2B9;) followed by a second nested PCR with a secondary primer set (5&#x2B9;-TACAGCCAGCTCTACCCCT-3&#x2B9; and 5&#x2B9;-ACCGCGTGGCCCCTGT-3&#x2B9;).

        <title>Cloning of the <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene complement of selected Triticeae</title>
        <p>Screening of two &#x3BB; phage libraries lead to the identification of four wheat and two rye unique <italic>PAPhy</italic> clones. The clones were partially sequenced in order to localize the coding sequence as well as the promoter, introns, and terminator sequences. Wheat <italic>TaPAPhy_a2</italic> and rye <italic>ScPAPhy_a1</italic> &#x3BB; clones contained only part of the coding sequences. In addition, a barley <italic>PAPhy</italic> &#x3BB; clone isolated previously was analysed in more detail in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Holme <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Introns and exons were annotated after alignment with the known cDNA clones and identification of the in-frame start and stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). One interruption of the coding sequence on the <italic>TaPAPhy_a2</italic> &#x3BB; clone was only 8bp and did not follow the GT&#x2013;AG rule for introns. PCR screening of nine wheat cultivars (including Chinese spring) showed that the 8-bp interruption was only present in the cultivars Skagen and Bob White (results not shown). Hence, this interruption was annotated as an insertion rather than an intron. All other interruptions of the coding sequences followed the GT&#x2013;AG rule as expected for typical introns.</p>

        <p content-type="indent">A PCR-based cloning strategy was designed as supplement to the library screenings. Sequence information from the &#x3BB; clones and known cDNA sequences was used to design primers in conserved regions 3&#x2013;400bp upstream of the start codon and 50&#x2013;250bp downstream of the stop codon. In wheat, all genes already known from the library screenings were isolated again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, two additional genes, termed <italic>TaPAPhy_b1</italic> and <italic>TaPAPhy_b2</italic>, were identified. In rye, the full coding sequence of <italic>ScPAPhy_a1</italic> was obtained and an additional gene, <italic>ScPAPhy_a2</italic>, was discovered. From barley, <italic>HvPAPhy_b1-2</italic> was identified. One <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> gene and one <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> gene were amplified from both einkorn and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>. The <italic>PAPhy</italic> 5&#x2B9;-flanking regions of the PCR clones were extended by inverted PCR and by consulting raw 454 reads of wheat available at CerealsDB. Using these techniques, the 5&#x2B9;-flanking regions were extended from 277bp in <italic>TaPAPhy_a2</italic> to a maximum of 713bp in <italic>HvPAPhy_b1-2</italic>. In summary, three <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and three <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes could be isolated from wheat. One <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and one <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> gene were cloned from each of barley, einkorn, and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>. In rye, two <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> genes and one <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes were isolated.

        <p>The cloned <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes contain either four or five introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Pairwise alignments of the genomic wheat and barley clones and the corresponding cDNA clones previously cloned and classified as <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> revealed that the <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> genes possessed four introns and the <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes possess five introns. The four introns of <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> were positioned as introns 1, 2, 4, and 5 of <italic>PAPhy_b</italic>. Barley is known to express one <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> transcript and two <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The known <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> transcript corresponds to the &#x3BB; clone of <italic>HvPAPhy_a1</italic>, but only one <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> gene was successfully cloned by PCR. However, this gene could account for both transcripts by differential splicing at the 3&#x2B9;-border of the third intron, where two alternative AG dinucleotides facilitate the inclusion or omission of a GAG codon. Because of the differential splicing of the barley <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> transcripts, this gene is referred to as <italic>HvPAPhy_b1-2</italic> and the two transcripts as <italic>HvPAPhy_b</italic>1 and <italic>HvPAPhy_b</italic>2. The three <italic>TaPAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>TaPAPhy_b</italic> genes isolated from Chinese Spring suggest that the two groups are a pair of paralogues with homoeologous loci on each of the three subgenomes A, B, and D. Moreover, only one <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> gene and one <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> gene could be isolated from the diploid carriers of the A and D genomes (einkorn and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>, respectively) and from barley (diploid).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">The wheat and barley <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes were chromosomally mapped to confirm or disprove the assumption of a single pair of paralogues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs.

The three <italic>TaPAPhy_a</italic> genes were mapped with one gene on each of the three subgenomes A, B, and D. The <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> genes were located on chromosome 5 in all wheat subgenomes and barley. The wheat <italic>TaPAPhy_b</italic> genes were distributed in a similar manner, with one locus on each of the three homoeologous subgenomes.

        <p>The <italic>TaPAPhy_a1</italic> coding sequence was blasted against the sequenced genomes of rice, maize, sorghum, and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> in the LATESTGP database (Gramene.org). The search sensitivity was set at &#x2018;near exact matches&#x2019;.

Contig views showing the <italic>TaPAPhy_a1</italic> coding sequence aligned to the chromosomes and predicted genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>. According to the Narcisse webtool, conserved synteny exists between <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 1, barley chromosome 5, maize chromosome 1, rice chromosome 3, and sorghum chromosome 2. This suggests that the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes on these chromosomes are orthologues. There was no conserved synteny between <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosomes 1 and 2.

        <p>The longest available sequences representing the individual Triticeae <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes were aligned and adjusted to include the beginning of the coding sequence and the 5&#x2B9;-flanking region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>). One in-frame ATG codon was conserved and aligned in the beginning of the predicted coding sequences of all 15 <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes. The four bases preceding the ATG agrees with the consensus start motif found for monocots G(A/C)(G/A)GC(A/C/G)(G/A)(C/A)(G/C<italic>)AUG</italic>GCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Nakagawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This codon was therefore assigned as the start codon.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">All 15 <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes were represented in the alignment up to position &#x2013;601bp (relative to the start codon). CAP-trapper-generated cDNA clones of <italic>TaPAPhy_a2</italic> and <italic>TaPAPhy_b2</italic> are available (Genbank AK331144.1 and AK331704.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Kawaura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The CAP trapper method ensures full transcript length clones (with an additional 5&#x2B9;-guanidine) so the clones facilitated the identification of conserved motives with positions and sequences corresponding to the TATA box and the near upstream element. Most genomic clones contained two adjacent TATA boxes and one contained two near upstream elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Transcription is expected to begin 25&#x2013;39bp downstream of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Joshi, 1987</xref>). Genomic vs. cDNA pairwise alignment demonstrated that the full transcript length <italic>TaPAPhy_a2</italic> cDNA clone starts 35bp downstream of the TATA box closest to the start codon (TATA box 1). The context of this site is conserved and it fits well with the &#x2018;cap signal&#x2019; (T/G)C(<italic>A/T</italic>)(G/T/C)(T/C/A)(C/T)(T/C/G)(T/C) reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Bucher, 1990</xref>). The adjacent alignment position is a better match to the cap signal for the <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes. The two positions were assigned as the transcriptional start sites when TATA box 1 is used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">The <italic>TaPAPhy_b2</italic> clone on the other hand have been transcribed via the second TATA box (TATA box 2) since it begins 38bp downstream at alignment position &#x2013;206. This position is only covered by the <italic>Triticum</italic> and <italic>Aegilops PAPhy_b</italic> genes, which appear to have an insertion here when they are compared to the <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> genes and to the barley and rye <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> sequences. The transcriptional start site of genes without the insertion is expected to be closer to the start codon because of the strict positional constraints of the TATA box and the transcriptional start site. A good candidate is alignment position &#x2013;186. This residue is conserved in all <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes and its consensus context CC<italic>A</italic>GACGA (position &#x2013;186 underlined) fits well with the cap signal.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">TATA box 1 aligns across all <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes at positions &#x2013;115 to &#x2013;121bp and it is surrounded by a 121-bp block of high conservation, even between <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>). The position of TATA box 2 was also conserved, although it is missing from <italic>TaPAPhy_b1</italic> and <italic>AePAPhy_b1</italic>. Moreover, as seen for TATA box 1, box 2 is surrounded by a segment of significant conservation across all <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes. However, for TATA box 2, the conserved region is much shorter (58bp) and less conserved (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ert116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>). The distance between the TATA boxes is 90 +/&#x2013; 28bp in all promoters except <italic>ScPAPhy_a2</italic>.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">In conclusion, the Triticeae <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes have a conserved core promoter usually consisting of two TATA boxes approximately 90bp apart and adjacent transcriptional start sites. The <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> 5&#x2B9;-UTR is 60&#x2013;70bp longer than the <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> 5&#x2B9;-UTR when transcripts are derived from the same TATA box. Pairwise alignment of the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> promoters (1000bp 5&#x2B9;-flanking regions) showed that they do not possess a conserved core promoter (results not shown).</p>

        <title>The <italic>PAPhy</italic>_ a and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> paralogues</title>
        <p>Chromosome mapping demonstrated that the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes of wheat and barley consists of a set of paralogous genes located on chromosomes 3 and 5 in each of the homoeologous genomes. This is in good agreement with a previous division of <italic>PAPhy</italic> proteins and transcripts into two isoforms, <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The gene on chromosome 5 generates the transcripts termed <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and the gene on chromosome 3 generates the <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> transcripts. It is reasonable to assume a similar chromosomal localization in the diploid carriers of the A and D genomes, i.e. einkorn and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>, respectively.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Rye possesses as the only investigated member of the Triticeae a duplicated <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> gene. The exact nature of this duplication remains to be investigated but the phylogenetic trees indicate that the two <italic>ScPAPhy_a</italic> genes are as divergent as the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes of wheat subgenome A and those of einkorn. This is notably more divergent than the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes of wheat subgenome D and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>. The wheat A subgenome and einkorn diverged between 0.5 and 1 million years ago whereas the hexaploidization which separated the wheat D subgenome from <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> occurred only 8000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Divergence of the <italic>Secale</italic> and <italic>Triticum</italic> genera occurred around 7 million years ago and rye was domesticated 10,000&#x2013;12,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Salamini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This suggests that the rye <italic>ScPAPhy_a</italic> duplication occurred long after speciation but prior to domestication. It is also possible that two different wild <italic>Secale</italic> species each have contributed a locus to domesticated rye.</p>
        <p content-type="indent"><italic>Brachypodium</italic> is the closest relative of the Triticeae which has been fully sequenced and assembled. The <italic>Brachypodium</italic> set of <italic>PAPhy</italic> paralogues is located on chromosomes 1 and 2. These chromosomes share orthologous linkage blocks with the Triticeae chromosomes 5 and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">International <italic>Brachypodium</italic> Initiative, 2010</xref>). The presence of orthologous linkage blocks on chromosomes carrying the paralogous <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes in <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and in Triticeae suggests that they originate from the same gene duplication event. This is supported by the high degree of shared intron/exon structure and the close phylogenetic relationship between the <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes and the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 2 gene. On the other hand, the gene on <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 1 is the most distant member of the clade. However, accelerated divergence can be caused by the functional redundancy introduced by the gene duplication itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Zhang, 2003</xref>). This is supported by the dotblot analysis which show that the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 1 <italic>PAPhy</italic> is the orthologue of the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes in rice, maize, and sorghum. The dotblot and alignment generated from the two <italic>Brachypodium</italic> sequences demonstrated that the duplication is of the same approximate size as the gene itself. Small duplications may result from retroposition but this would usually result in the loss of introns and certainly the loss of the core promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Zhang, 2003</xref>). The core promoter is preserved in the Triticeae and introns are preserved in both <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and Triticeae. The duplication must therefore be of the segmental type.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Other sequenced grasses (rice, maize, and sorghum) contain only one <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene. This raises the question of gene duplication vs. gene loss. All the Triticeae <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes and the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 2 gene were phylogenetically closer to each other than to the <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes of maize, rice, and sorghum. The duplication is therefore younger that the divergence of the species. Further, it is older than the divergence of <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and the Triticeae since they share it. This indicates duplication between 54 and 32 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">International <italic>Brachypodium</italic> Initiative, 2010</xref>). The most ancient gene must be that, which is shared with all the examined grasses, i.e. the <italic>PAPhy_a</italic>/<italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 1 gene.</p>

        <title>The divergent promoters of <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic>
</title>
        <p>Analysis of the 5&#x2B9;-flanking region of eight Triticeae <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and seven Triticeae <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> genes revealed a conserved core promoter with two TATA boxes. The two full-length transcripts demonstrate that both TATA boxes are active albeit in different genes. The high conservation of both TATA boxes and their associated transcriptional start sites suggest that both TATA boxes are generally active.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">There was no significant conservation between <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> upstream of the core promoter, but orthologues showed conservation for an additional 150&#x2013;200bp. The upstream sequences of the paralogous promoters of <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> and <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> contained <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements consistent with the differentiated expression reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Dionisio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Thus, <italic>PAPhy_b</italic> contained the giberellic acid response element typical for hydrolases expressed during germination in response to gibberellic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Ritchie and Gilroy, 1998</xref>). For <italic>PAPhy_a</italic>, the promoters contain the overlapping motifs of the odd base C box and the RY-element. The same motif can also be described as a triad consisting of the GCN4 motif, the skn1 motif, and the RY-element. These motives have been described in promoters driving expression of storage protein genes during seed formation and grain filling. For instance, the RY element has been found and proven functional in promoters of dicot storage proteins such as legumins or conglycinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">B&#xE4;umlein <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Fujiwara and Beachy, 1994</xref>). Similarly the odd base C box has been found in lectin promoters, hordeins and rice glutelins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">M&#xFC;ller and Knudsen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">De Pater <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Takaiwa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). This study&#x2019;s reporter gene experiment shows that this double motif or triad is critical for the expression of <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> during grain filling in barley.</p>

        <title>Phytase activity in the wider Triticeae tribe and <italic>Brachypodium</italic>
</title>
        <p>The present data agrees with previously reported values for wheat, barley, and rye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Eeckhout and De Paepe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Viveros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Steiner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A collection encompassing einkorn, <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> accessions was also assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). As far as is known, these are the first published MGPA values for the three species. The MGPA measurements of einkorn and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> provide further evidence of the association of high MGPA with the Triticeae tribe but the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> data demonstrate that the trait is not restricted to the Triticeae. Rather, it is associated with the duplication of the <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene which is shared by <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and the Triticeae. However, it is not a simple matter of gene dosage, since the trait is conferred by a specialized locus in the Triticeae (<italic>PAPhy_a</italic>). The <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> locus is the parent locus so the changed expression pattern cannot result from the duplication as such, for instance because of a new chromosomal context of the gene. The expression pattern of the <italic>Brachypodium PAPhy</italic> genes remain to be investigated but it is clear that phytase is expressed during grain filling even though neither gene share the features of the Triticeae <italic>PAPhy_a</italic> promoter. This is not unexpected, since numerous promoters can provide expression during grain filling. The observation suggests that evolution of high MGPA has happened independently in <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and the Triticeae after the gene duplication. The neofunctionalization of the gene is best explained by positive selection in light of the observations above. Neofunctionalization appears to have been countered by stronger purifying selection in grasses with a single <italic>PAPhy</italic> gene, presumably because phytase activity during germination is important for the successful lifecycle of the plant. Relaxation of the purifying selection by the gene duplication was therefore critical for the evolution of high MGPA in the Triticeae and <italic>Brachypodium</italic>. This indicates that the room for improvement of the MGPA by breeding is much more restricted in cereals with a single <italic>PAPhy</italic> than in cereals with two or more <italic>PAPhy</italic> genes.</p>
