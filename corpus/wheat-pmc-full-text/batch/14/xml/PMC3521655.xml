      <abstract>
        <p>Most of the natural variation in wheat vernalization response is determined by allelic differences in the MADS-box transcription factor <italic>VERNALIZATION1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic>). Extended exposures to low temperatures during the winter (vernalization) induce <italic>VRN1</italic> expression and promote the transition of the apical meristem to the reproductive phase. In contrast to its Arabidopsis homolog (<italic>APETALA1</italic>), which is mainly expressed in the apical meristem, <italic>VRN1</italic> is also expressed at high levels in the leaves, but its function in this tissue is not well understood. Using tetraploid wheat lines with truncation mutations in the two homoeologous copies of <italic>VRN1</italic> (henceforth <italic>vrn1</italic>-null mutants), we demonstrate that a central role of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves is to maintain low transcript levels of the <italic>VRN2</italic> flowering repressor after vernalization. Transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> were gradually down-regulated during vernalization in both mutant and wild-type genotypes, but were up-regulated after vernalization only in the <italic>vrn1</italic>-null mutants. The up-regulation of <italic>VRN2</italic> delayed flowering by repressing the transcription of <italic>FT</italic>, a flowering-integrator gene that encodes a mobile protein that is transported from the leaves to the apical meristem to induce flowering. The role of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the delayed flowering of the <italic>vrn1</italic>-null mutant was confirmed using double <italic>vrn1-vrn2-</italic>null mutants, which flowered two months earlier than the <italic>vrn1</italic>-null mutants. Both mutants produced normal flowers and seeds demonstrating that <italic>VRN1</italic> is not essential for wheat flowering, which contradicts current flowering models. This result does not diminish the importance of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the seasonal regulation of wheat flowering. The up-regulation of <italic>VRN1</italic> during winter is required to maintain low transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic>, accelerate the induction of <italic>FT</italic> in the leaves, and regulate a timely flowering in the spring. Our results also demonstrate the existence of redundant wheat flowering genes that may provide new targets for engineering wheat varieties better adapted to changing environments.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Crop yields are strongly associated with flowering time, therefore a precise understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of flowering is required to engineer varieties adapted to new or changing environments. In wheat, most of the natural variation in flowering time is determined by <italic>VERNALIZATION1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic>), a gene responsible for the transition of the apical meristem from the vegetative to the reproductive phase. Extended exposures to low temperatures during winter (vernalization) induce <italic>VRN1</italic> expression, which promotes flowering in the spring. <italic>VRN1</italic> is expressed in the apices and in the leaves, but its role in the leaves is not well understood. Using two sets of <italic>VRN1</italic> knock-out mutants, we demonstrate that a central role of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves is to maintain low transcript levels of the <italic>VRN2</italic> flowering repressor, which allows the production of the mobile FT protein (florigen) required to initiate flowering. Both sets of <italic>VRN1</italic> knock-out mutants flowered very late but, eventually, produced normal flowers and seeds, which demonstrates that <italic>VRN1</italic> is not essential for wheat flowering. This last result also demonstrates the existence of redundant flowering genes that could provide new targets for engineering flowering time in wheat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The temperate grasses, which include economically important species such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats, are well-adapted to cold winters. Most of these species require a prolonged period of cold treatment for timely flowering, a process referred to as vernalization. This requirement delays the initiation of the reproductive phase and protects the sensitive floral meristems from frost damage during the winter. It also contributes to the precise adjustment of flowering time to seasonal changes, which is important to maximize seed production. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of wheat flowering can contribute to the engineering of high yielding varieties adapted to changing environments.</p>

However, the mechanisms involved in the interactions among these genes are still controversial <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To facilitate the discussion of these complex interactions, the information available for these three regulatory genes is presented first.</p>
      <p>The <italic>VRN3</italic> gene is the main integrator of the vernalization and photoperiod signals in the temperate grasses <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This gene encodes a RAF kinase inhibitor&#x2013;like protein with high similarity to Arabidopsis protein FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and will therefore, be designated as FT hereafter. In Arabidopsis, <italic>FT</italic> transcription is induced by long days in the leaves and the encoded protein travels through the phloem to the stem apical meristem <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Corbesier1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. There, FT interacts with the bZIP transcription factor FD and up-regulates the expression of the meristem identity gene <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>), which leads to the transition of the stem apical meristem from the vegetative to the reproductive phase <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Wigge1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A similar interaction has been observed in wheat, where the homologous FT protein interacts with an FD-like protein (FDL2) that has the ability to bind <italic>in vitro</italic> the promoter of <italic>VRN1,</italic> the wheat homolog of <italic>AP1</italic>

          <title>Effect of photoperiod and vernalization on wheat flowering time.</title>
          <p>During the fall, VRN2 competes successfully with CO (photoperiod pathway, <italic>FT</italic> promoter) for interactions with the NF-Y transcription factors, resulting in the down-regulation of <italic>FT</italic> transcription in the leaves <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This precludes flowering in the fall. Vernalization induces <italic>VRN1</italic> and down-regulates <italic>VRN2</italic> transcription in the leaves. The presence of VRN1 after the winter is important to maintain the down-regulation of <italic>VRN2</italic> during the spring. In the absence of <italic>VRN2, FT</italic> transcription is up-regulated and the encoded FT protein is transported through the phloem to the stem apical meristem. FT then interacts with FDL2 <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> to up-regulate <italic>VRN1</italic> transcripts to the levels required for the transition to the reproductive phase. Dashed red lines indicate interactions demonstrated in this study.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The insertion of a repetitive element in the <italic>FT</italic> promoter in the wheat variety Hope results in the overexpression of <italic>FT</italic> and early flowering. Transformation of a winter wheat with this <italic>FT</italic> allele results in accelerated flowering even in the absence of vernalization, which suggests that high <italic>FT</italic> transcript levels are sufficient to overcome the vernalization requirement <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, transcript levels of different wheat and barley <italic>FT</italic> alleles correlate well with flowering time, which suggests that the amount of <italic>FT</italic> transcript in the leaves is critical for the regulation of flowering time in the temperate cereals <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>FT</italic> and upstream genes of the photoperiod pathway are well conserved between Arabidopsis and the temperate cereals, but the vernalization genes in these species are very different. The main Arabidopsis vernalization genes <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) and <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>) have not been detected in the temperate cereals, and similarly, the central flowering repressor <italic>VRN2</italic> has not been detected in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite the fact that they belong to different classes of proteins, VRN2 and FLC both repress <italic>FT</italic> and prevent flowering until the plants are vernalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Hemming2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Recent studies suggest that the negative regulation of <italic>FT</italic> transcription by <italic>VRN2</italic> in the temperate cereals is mediated by the competition between VRN2 and the photoperiod protein CONSTANS (CO, a promoter of <italic>FT</italic> expression) for binding with a common set of NF-Y transcription factors <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g001">Figure 1</xref>). NF-Y transcription factors have been shown to be involved in <italic>FT</italic> activation in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kumimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kumimoto2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>VRN2</italic> locus includes two tandemly duplicated CCT domain (<italic><underline>C</underline>ONSTANS, <underline>C</underline>O-like</italic>, and <italic><underline>T</underline>OC1</italic>) genes, <italic>ZCCT1</italic> and <italic>ZCCT2</italic>, which function as long day flowering repressors <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Simultaneous deletions or non-functional mutations in all <italic>ZCCT</italic> genes result in a spring growth habit in both barley and wheat <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the commercial tetraploid wheat varieties studied thus far (including the variety &#x2018;Kronos&#x2019; used in this study), <italic>ZCCT-A1</italic>, <italic>ZCCT-A2</italic>, and <italic>ZCCT-B1</italic> all have natural deleterious mutations in the CCT domain and the only functional copies are the two similar <italic>ZCCT-B2</italic> genes present in the <italic>VRN-B2</italic> locus <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, a natural deletion including both <italic>ZCCT-B2</italic> genes was sufficient to generate a tetraploid wheat with spring growth habit <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Indirect evidence suggests that <italic>VRN2</italic> transcription is repressed in the spring by the up-regulation of VRN1, closing a positive feedback regulatory loop that is central for the precise regulation of flowering time in the temperate cereals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Loukoianov1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The wheat <italic>VRN1</italic> gene encodes a MADS-box transcription factor closely related to the three paralogous Arabidopsis meristem identity genes <italic>AP1, CAULIFLOWER</italic> (<italic>CAL</italic>) and <italic>FRUITFULL</italic> (<italic>FUL</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Trevaskis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>VRN1</italic> transcripts are significantly up-regulated during vernalization, both under long and short days. Since <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic> transcript levels are undetectable under short days <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Dubcovsky2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Trevaskis2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it was concluded that <italic>VRN1</italic> is a direct target of vernalization. This conclusion agrees with the observation that vernalization promotes an active chromatin state by increasing levels of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and decreasing H3K27me3 in <italic>VRN1</italic> regulatory regions but not in those of <italic>VRN2</italic> or <italic>FT</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the temperate cereals there are two additional MADs-box genes similar to <italic>VRN1</italic> designated as <italic>FUL2</italic> (&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>HvMADS8&#x200A;=&#x200A;OsMADS15</italic>) and <italic>FUL3</italic> (&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>HvMADS3&#x200A;=&#x200A;OsMADS18</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Preston1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The duplications that gave rise to these three paralogous genes in wheat are independent from the duplications in Arabidopsis since they occurred after the monocot-dicot divergence <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Therefore, the sub-functionalization of the duplicated meristem identity genes was also independent in these two lineages. In Arabidopsis, <italic>AP1</italic> and <italic>CAL</italic> transcripts are mostly confined to the developing flowers <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> whereas <italic>FUL</italic> transcripts are detected both in apices and leaves but at low levels <xref rid="pgen.1003134-TeperBamnolker1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In contrast, high levels of <italic>VRN1</italic> have been observed in the leaves of the temperate grasses before the emergence of spikelet primordia, which suggests that <italic>VRN1</italic> is part of an early signal involved in the transition from the vegetative to reproductive stages <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kinjo1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In Arabidopsis, all three paralogs have retained meristem identity functions, and only the triple <italic>ap1-cal-ful</italic> mutant is unable to form flowers <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Ferrndiz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In rice, in addition to the <italic>AP1/FUL2/FUL3</italic> homologs a fourth MADS-box gene (<italic>OsMADS34</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>PAP2</italic>) needs to be deleted to abolish the transition of the shoot apical meristem to the reproductive stage <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In contrast, diploid wheat radiation mutants lacking the <italic>VRN1</italic> gene are unable to flower, which suggests that <italic>VRN1</italic> is essential for wheat flowering <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Shitsukawa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. These mutants, designated <italic><underline>m</underline>aintained <underline>v</underline>egetative <underline>p</underline>hase</italic> (<italic>mvp</italic>) showed an unexpected down-regulation of <italic>FT</italic> transcript levels <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, that was not predicted by current flowering models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, a more recent study showed that the radiation deletions that eliminated <italic>VRN1</italic> were much larger than originally described and included the wheat ortholog of <italic>PAP2</italic> (<italic>AGLG1</italic>), the <italic>PHYTOCHROME C</italic> (<italic>PHYC</italic>) and several other linked genes. Therefore, the <italic>mvp</italic> mutant results are open to alternative interpretations that are at the center of conflicting flowering models in the temperate grasses <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To determine the specific role of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the induction of flowering and in the regulation of down-stream flowering genes we developed truncation mutants for the A and B genome copies of <italic>VRN1</italic> in tetraploid wheat (henceforth, &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1</italic>) and combined them to generate two sets of mutants with no functional copies of <italic>VRN1</italic> (henceforth, &#x394;<italic>vrn1</italic>-null). Using these mutants we demonstrate that functional VRN1 proteins are not essential for wheat flowering or for the up-regulation of <italic>FT</italic>. We also show that <italic>VRN1</italic> expression in the leaves is important for maintaining low transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the leaves after vernalization, which is critical for a timely flowering in the spring.</p>

          <p>The Kronos tetraploid cultivar used to develop the TILLING population carries a functional <italic>VRN-A1</italic> allele, which is defined by a large deletion in intron one associated with spring growth habit. Kronos <italic>VRN-B1</italic> allele has no intron one deletion and is responsive to vernalization <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. As described in the introduction, the two closely related <italic>ZCCT-B2</italic> genes (<italic>VRN-B2</italic> locus) are the only functional <italic>ZCCT</italic> copies in Kronos <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> allele for spring growth habit is dominant and epistatic to <italic>VRN2</italic>, Kronos has a spring growth habit. This genotype will be referred to as &#x201C;wild type&#x201D; in this study.</p>
          <p>The screening of the tetraploid Kronos TILLING population <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Uauy1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> with primers described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s007">Table S1</xref> yielded 33 mutations for the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> gene (&#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic>) and 44 mutations for the <italic>VRN-B1</italic> gene (&#x394;<italic>vrn-B1</italic>). Mutations resulting in truncations or amino acid changes are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s008">Table S2</xref>. Two mutations resulting in either a premature stop codon or the removal of a splice site were selected for each <italic>VRN1</italic> homeolog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). For each of these mutations we recovered homozygous lines, which all show a single chromatogram peak at the mutant site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This result demonstrates that Kronos has a single copy of each of the <italic>VRN1</italic> homoeologs.</p>

          <p>Mutants &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1<sub>2235</sub></italic> and &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1<sub>1254</sub></italic> have premature stop codons in exons three and four. These mutant alleles encode VRN1 proteins that lack approximately half of the conserved K-box (45% to 66%, respectively) and the complete activation domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Sequencing of the &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic>
<sub>2268</sub> transcripts revealed that the mutation at the acceptor splice site of intron two (AG to AA) resulted in the utilization of the mutated base and the adjacent G in exon three as a new acceptor splice site. This 1-bp frame shift mutation resulted in an altered protein sequence with a premature stop after the first nine amino acids. The mutations at the donor splice site of intron one (GT to AT) in &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1</italic>
<sub>2619</sub> resulted in an immediate stop codon. Transcripts from this <italic>VRN-B1</italic> allele were not detected in the expression experiments (PCR primers in exon junction 5&#x2013;6 and exon 8 <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>), likely due to the long (&#x223C;10 kb) un-spliced intron one. Proteins encoded by the two splice site mutants are predicted to have truncations including 84% and 100% of the conserved K-box and the complete activation domain. In summary, the large truncations predicted in the four VRN1 mutant proteins are almost certain to knock-out its normal function.</p>

          <p>The individual mutants were backcrossed once to the non-mutagenized Kronos to reduce background mutations and were then inter-crossed to produce two independent mutants with no functional copies of <italic>VRN1</italic> (&#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null).

          <p>The <italic>VRN1</italic> mutations from the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null set 2 were also combined with mutations in the <italic>VRN2</italic> genes from a &#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null tetraploid mutant identified in a previous study <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

The &#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null mutant was backcrossed twice to Kronos and then inter-crossed with the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null to generate a line lacking functional copies of both <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic> genes, which is designated hereafter as &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null.

          <p>In the absence of vernalization, the two sets of &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants headed 11&#x2013;15 days later than the &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> single mutants but the differences were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). However, when these plants were vernalized, the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants flowered 62 and 113 days later than the corresponding &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), which indicates that the lack of functional VRN1 proteins in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants greatly reduced their ability to respond to vernalization. This response, however, was not completely eliminated, since vernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants still flowered 37 days (<italic>P</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.005, set 1) and 31 days (<italic>P</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.035, set 2) earlier than the unvernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This result was further confirmed in an independent experiment, in which the vernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants flowered 27 days earlier than the unvernalized ones (set 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

          <p>To determine if the extended delay in flowering of the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants was mediated by the flowering repressor <italic>VRN2</italic>, we compared heading times of the unvernalized sib lines &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null (set 2) and &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null. These two lines carry the same <italic>VRN1</italic> splice site mutations but differ in the presence or absence of functional <italic>VRN2</italic> genes. On average, the unvernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null plants headed 63 days earlier than the unvernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null sib lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), which indicates that the <italic>VRN2</italic> gene has a large effect on the late flowering phenotype of the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants.</p>
          <p>Even though the unvernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null flowered 2 months earlier than the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants, they still flowered 37 days later than the unvernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null control that carries a functional vernalization-insensitive <italic>VRN-A1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003134-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since these two mutants differ only in the presence or absence of the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> allele, it can be concluded that this allele has the ability to accelerate flowering even in the absence of <italic>VRN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
          <p>A comparison between the un-vernalized and vernalized &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null plants showed that the vernalized plants flowered on average 23 days earlier than the unvernalized ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). This result indicates that the redundant genes responsible for flowering in the absence of functional VRN1 proteins are able to respond to vernalization even in the absence of VRN2.</p>

          <p>In the unvernalized plants, an inverse correlation was observed between the transcript levels of <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic>, similar to the one described in previous studies <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Loukoianov1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1</italic> spring mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, blue solid lines) showed the highest transcript levels of <italic>VRN1</italic> and the lowest transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> and the opposite was observed in the &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null winter mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, red and green solid lines).</p>
          <p>The comparison of the <italic>VRN2</italic> transcript profiles among the different genotypes revealed two important results. First, the <italic>VRN2</italic> genes were down-regulated during vernalization in both the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null and &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.002, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2F</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.0009). This result shows for the first time that <italic>VRN1</italic> is not essential for the down-regulation of <italic>VRN2</italic> by vernalization. Second, a rapid increase in the transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> to pre-vernalization levels was observed two weeks after the vernalized plants were returned to room temperature in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants but not in the other genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, RT). At the same time point, the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants showed lower transcript levels of <italic>FT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, RT) and <italic>VRN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, RT) than the &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> mutants. Similar results were confirmed in the second set of &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2F</xref>).</p>
          <p>We conclude from these results that an important role of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves is to maintain the repression of the <italic>VRN2</italic> genes after vernalization. The inability of the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants to maintain low levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> expression after vernalization correlates well with the reduced vernalization response of the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants relative to the &#x394;<italic>vrn-A1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
          <p>Even though the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants showed a large delay in flowering time they eventually flowered. At heading time the transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the flag leaves were almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3E&#x2013;3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2E</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">S2F</xref>) and the transcript levels of <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> were relatively high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3A&#x2013;3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">S2D</xref> dotted lines), both in the vernalized and unvernalized plants.

          <p>The &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants (functional <italic>VRN2</italic>) showed undetectable levels of FT both in the vernalized and the un-vernalized plants during this experiment. In contrast, the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null mutants (non-functional <italic>VRN2</italic>) showed very high transcript levels of <italic>FT</italic> by the end of the experiment, both in the vernalized and unvernalized plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g004">Figure 4C&#x2013;4D</xref>). The significantly higher levels of <italic>FT</italic> observed in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null than in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants correlate well with the two-month flowering difference observed between these two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results also demonstrate that the ability of <italic>VRN2</italic> to repress <italic>FT</italic> transcription is not dependent on <italic>VRN1</italic>.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, <italic>FT</italic> transcript levels in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null mutants jumped from undetectable levels to 18-fold <italic>ACTIN</italic> two weeks after the plants were removed from vernalization. In the unvernalized plants, <italic>FT</italic> increased only from 0.1 to 1.8-fold <italic>ACTIN</italic> during the last two weeks of the experiment. This result is consistent with the significant acceleration in flowering time observed in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null mutants (23 days) after eight weeks of vernalization.</p>

To test this hypothesis, we analysed the transcript levels of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> in two pairs of isogenic lines differing in <italic>FT</italic> transcript levels and heading time <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).</p>
          <p>The first pair of isogenic lines included the late-spring variety Chinese Spring (CS) and a substitution line of chromosome 7B from the variety Hope in CS (henceforth, CS-H7B).

However, a later study showed that the deletions in the <italic>mvp</italic> mutants including <italic>VRN1</italic> were larger than initially proposed, and encompassed several genes including <italic>PHYC</italic>, an important light receptor and <italic>AGLG1,</italic> the wheat ortholog of rice <italic>PAP2</italic>

        <p>The &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants developed in this study allowed us to separate the effect of <italic>VRN1</italic> from the effect of the other genes included in the <italic>mvp</italic> deletions. The production of normal flowers and seeds in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null and &#x394;<italic>vrn1-vrn2-</italic>null mutants demonstrates that <italic>VRN1</italic> is not essential for wheat flowering, and that the non-flowering phenotype of the <italic>mvp</italic> mutants is not solely determined by the deletion of <italic>VRN1.</italic> In addition, the early flowering time of the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-vrn2-</italic>null mutant indicates the existence of redundant flowering genes that are capable of rapidly inducing flowering in wheat in the absence of functional VRN1 and VRN2 proteins.</p>

This three- to four- fold reduction in the acceleration of flowering by vernalization in the mutants with truncated copies of <italic>VRN1</italic> confirms the important role this gene plays in the vernalization response in wheat. However, the fact that a significant acceleration of flowering by vernalization was still detected in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants indicates the existence of unidentified genes with the ability to respond to vernalization.

        <title>VRN1 plays a central role in the repression of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the leaves after winter</title>
        <p>Loukoianov and collaborators <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Loukoianov1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> observed a negative correlation between the transcript levels of <italic>VRN1</italic> and the transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the leaves of isogenic hexaploid wheat lines carrying different <italic>VRN1</italic> spring alleles, and hypothesized that <italic>VRN1</italic> functions as a negative transcriptional regulator of <italic>VRN2</italic>. This negative interaction became an integral part of a feedback regulatory loop placed at the center of current flowering models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g001">Figure 1</xref>), but has never been conclusively demonstrated before this study.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> from the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants confirmed the validity of the previous hypothesis. Only the mutant lines with no functional copies of <italic>VRN1</italic> showed an up-regulation of <italic>VRN2</italic> transcript to pre-vernalization levels when the plants were removed from the vernalization treatment and were transferred back to room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2F</xref>). This result, observed in the two independent sets of &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants, confirmed that one specific role of <italic>VRN1</italic> is to maintain low transcript levels of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the leaves following winter, when the longer day length and warmer weather conditions favour the induction of <italic>VRN2</italic> transcription. The transcriptional activation of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves during vernalization provides an important regulatory signal that controls the transition from vegetative growth in the fall to reproductive development in the spring. In the fall, low <italic>VRN1</italic> transcript levels result in high <italic>VRN2</italic> expression, the repression of <italic>FT,</italic> and the maintenance of vegetative growth. During the winter <italic>VRN1</italic> is up-regulated and <italic>VRN2</italic> is down-regulated. The presence of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves prevents <italic>VRN2</italic> from being up-regulated during the longer and warmer days of spring, which facilitates the transcriptional activation of <italic>FT</italic> and the induction of flowering. In summary, the negative regulation of <italic>VRN2</italic> by <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves is a key regulatory step in the seasonal responses of winter wheat. It remains to be determined whether the VRN1 protein interacts directly with the <italic>VRN2</italic> gene or whether other genes mediate this regulatory interaction.</p>

<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Distelfeld2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Trevaskis3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>However, in this study we observed down-regulation of <italic>VRN2</italic> during vernalization in both sets of &#x394;<italic>vrn1</italic>-null mutants, which encode for truncated VRN1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2F</xref>).

However, our results indicate that <italic>FT</italic> can reach very high transcript levels in the absence of functional VRN1 proteins both in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null and &#x394;<italic>vrn1-vrn2-</italic>null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g003">Figure 3C&#x2013;3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">Figure S2C</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s002">S2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Although, we cannot completely rule out the very unlikely possibility that the truncated VRN1 proteins in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants are able to up-regulate <italic>FT</italic>, we favor the hypothesis that the permanent down-regulation of <italic>FT</italic> in the <italic>mvp</italic> mutants is caused by the deletion of additional genes closely linked to <italic>VRN1</italic> and included in the same deletion. The <italic>PHYC</italic> is a potential candidate to explain these differences since mutations in the <italic>PHYC</italic> gene are known to affect flowering time in both rice <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Takano1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Monte1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, the effects described in these model species are not as large as those observed in the <italic>mvp</italic> mutants, suggesting the possibility that the non-flowering phenotype of the <italic>mvp</italic> mutants is caused by other genes in the deletion or by the combination of deletions of more than one gene. We are currently developing a wheat <italic>phyC-</italic>null mutant to test the contribution of this gene to the regulation of flowering time in wheat. Another potential candidate among the genes deleted in the <italic>mvp</italic> mutants is the MADS-box gene <italic>AGLG1.</italic> The rice homolog of <italic>AGLG1</italic> (<italic>PAP2</italic>) is expressed in the shoot apical meristem during the initiation of the reproductive stage at the same time as the meristem identity genes (<italic>OsMADS14</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>VRN1</italic>, <italic>OsMADS15</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>OsMADS18</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>FUL3</italic>). A null allele of the <italic>PAP2</italic> locus combined with reduced expression of the three meristem identity genes by RNA interference down-regulates <italic>FT</italic> expression in the leaves and inhibits the transition of the apical meristem from the vegetative to reproductive phase <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In wheat, <italic>AGLG1</italic> transcripts are detected in the developing spike later than <italic>VRN1</italic> and are not detected in the leaves <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These results suggest that these homologous genes play different roles in the regulation of flowering initiation in rice and wheat.</p>
        <p>The transcription profiles of <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic> in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null and &#x394;<italic>vrn1-vrn2-</italic>null mutants provide additional evidence that contradicts the predictions of the &#x2018;reverse&#x2019; flowering model. This comparison shows that even in the absence of functional copies of <italic>VRN1</italic>, the deletion of <italic>VRN2</italic> results in the up-regulation of <italic>FT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g004">Figure 4C&#x2013;4D</xref>). This result is difficult to explain by the reverse model, which proposes that the negative regulation of <italic>FT</italic> by VRN2 requires the presence of functional VRN1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to the genetic evidence discussed above, biochemical interactions described in previous studies support the interactions proposed in the &#x2018;original&#x2019; model. The proposed regulation of <italic>VRN1</italic> by FT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) in wheat is consistent with the known interactions between FT and <italic>AP1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic> homolog) in Arabidopsis. In this species, the FT protein is synthesized in the leaves and is transported through the phloem to the stem apical meristem where it forms a complex with the bZIP transcription factor FD and binds to the promoter of <italic>AP1</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Wigge1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Similarly, the wheat FT protein interacts with the bZIP transcription factor FDL2 which interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> with the <italic>VRN1</italic> promoter <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In rice, the FT homolog (Hd3a) interacts with OsFD1 and a 14-3-3 protein to form a complex that binds the promoter of the rice homolog of <italic>FUL2</italic> (<italic>OsMADS15</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Taoka1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A biochemical mechanism has been proposed also for the repression of <italic>FT</italic> by VRN2 <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Using a yeast-three-hybrid system Li et al. (2011) showed that VRN2 and CONSTANS proteins compete for binding with a common set of NF-Y transcription factors, which have been shown to be involved in the regulation of <italic>FT</italic> in Arabidopsis <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kumimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kumimoto2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

        <title>Future directions</title>
        <p>The fact that both sets of &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null null mutants were able to flower and set normal seeds, demonstrated the existence of redundant flowering genes with meristem identity functions overlapping those of <italic>VRN1</italic>. The MADS-box genes <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> are the closest paralogs of <italic>VRN1</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Preston1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and therefore, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that their encoded proteins have retained meristem identity functions that can compensate for the lack of a functional VRN1 protein. A similar redundant system exists in Arabidopsis, in which only simultaneous mutations in the three duplicated meristem identity genes <italic>AP1-CAL&#x2013;FUL</italic> results in mutants that are unable to form flowers under all tested environmental conditions <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Ferrndiz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The existence of functional redundancy in the meristem identity genes is also evident in rice, where the down-regulation of individual meristem identity genes <italic>OsMADS14</italic> (&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>VRN1</italic>), <italic>OsMADS15</italic> (&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>FUL2</italic>) or <italic>OsMADS18</italic> (<italic>FUL3</italic>) has limited effect on flowering time <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Fornara1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Only the simultaneous downregulation of the three rice meristem identity genes in combination with <italic>pap2</italic> mutants resulted in extensive delays in stem elongation and severely perturbed inflorescence development <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In wheat and barley, previous studies have provided some indirect evidence that support the hypothesis that FUL2 and FUL3 have retained overlapping functions with VRN1. First, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies have shown similar spatial and temporal transcription profiles of these three genes during the initial stages of spike development <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kinjo1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Preston2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Adam1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, wheat <italic>FUL2</italic> and rice <italic>FUL3</italic> genes were shown to induce flowering when over expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice plants <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Kinjo1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003134-Fornara1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The experiments described in this study showed additional similarities between <italic>FUL2, FUL3</italic> and <italic>VRN1</italic> genes. First, the transcript levels of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> were significantly up-regulated during vernalization independently of <italic>VRN1</italic> and this up-regulation was proportional to the duration of the cold treatment, as described before for <italic>VRN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s004">Figure S4A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s004">S4B</xref>). Second, the transcript levels of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> were negatively regulated by <italic>VRN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g005">Figure 5</xref>

<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s005">Figure S5A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s005">S5B</xref>) and positively regulated by <italic>FT</italic> in transgenic wheat plants overexpressing <italic>FT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s006">Figure S6B</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003134.s006">S6D</xref>). Finally, when &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutant plants were moved from the cold to room temperature, <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> transcripts returned to pre-vernalization levels in the mature leaves but not in the actively dividing apices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Since cell division is required to establish epigenetic changes, the different transcriptional profiles in these two tissues may reflect the epigenetic regulation of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> by vernalization, as shown before for <italic>VRN1</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003134-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Studies of the chromatin changes in the regulatory regions of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> will be required to rule out alternative explanations. In summary, the similar patterns of transcriptional regulation, together with the similar <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization profiles in early spike development and the early flowering of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> transgenic plants, support the existence of some overlapping functions between <italic>FUL2</italic>, <italic>FUL3</italic> and <italic>VRN1</italic>. We have initiated the development of a triple <italic>vrn1-ful2-ful3</italic> mutant in tetraploid wheat to test the roles of <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> in flowering initiation in wheat.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above similarities, a critical difference was observed in the ability of these three meristem identity genes to regulate <italic>VRN2</italic> expression in the leaves. In the absence of functional <italic>VRN1</italic> genes, <italic>VRN2</italic> was up-regulated after vernalization in the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>null mutants, in spite of the presence of functional <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> genes. This result suggests that <italic>FUL2</italic> and <italic>FUL3</italic> are unable to maintain the repression of <italic>VRN2</italic> after vernalization.</p>
        <p>In summary, this study demonstrates that a central role of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves is to maintain the repression of <italic>VRN2</italic> after the winter to promote timely flowering in the spring. In spite of its important role in the seasonal regulation of flowering, our results demonstrate that <italic>VRN1</italic> is not essential for flowering and raise new questions regarding the roles of <italic>FUL2, FUL3, AGLG1</italic> and <italic>PHYC</italic> in the regulation of flowering initiation in wheat. Flowering time is a key component of wheat adaptation and productivity and therefore, a precise understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the initiation of flowering will be beneficial to engineer wheat cultivars better adapted to a changing environment.</p>

        <p>RNA samples were extracted from leaves using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Purified RNA samples were checked for RNA integrity by running 0.5 &#xB5;g RNA on a 1% agarose gel. All samples showed clear 18S and 25S ribosomal RNA bands indicating lack of RNA degradation. Melting curves showed a single peak, which confirmed amplification of a single product.

        <title>Experimental conditions for the different experiments</title>
        <p>The flowering experiments for the <italic>VRN1</italic> mutants were performed in CONVIRON growth chambers. Long day photoperiod experiments were performed with 16 h of light (6 am to 10 pm, including 1 hour ramp at the beginning and end of the cycle) and 8 h of dark. Intensity of the sodium halide lights measured at plant head height was 260 &#xB5;M s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. For the unvernalized plants day temperatures were set at 22&#xB0;C and night temperatures at 17&#xB0;C respectively. Relative humidity in the chambers was maintained at 60% throughout the entire experiment.</p>
        <p>All the vernalization experiments in this study were performed under long days to separate the effect of low temperature from the overlapping effects of short days. Day and night temperatures were 4&#xB0;C whereas light intensity and relative humidity were identical to the unvernalized experiments. Unvernalized control plants were planted 5 weeks after the sowing of the vernalized plants to allow both groups of plants to reach a similar number of leaves by the end of the vernalization treatment. Even though the developmental stages of the two groups were coordinated, the vernalization treatment can still affect the subsequent growth rates after vernalization. To eliminate this potential difference, spring lines with no vernalization requirement were included as controls in both vernalized and unvernalized treatments. The differences in heading time between the vernalized and unvernalized vernalization-insensitive spring lines were used to adjust the heading times of the other vernalized plants. The &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1</italic> mutants were used as controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and the &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null mutant was used as a control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. Both control lines carry the functional vernalization-insensitive <italic>VRN-A1</italic> allele. The &#x394;<italic>vrn-B1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null mutant has the additional deletion of all functional copies of <italic>VRN2</italic> and differs from the &#x394;<italic>vrn1-</italic>&#x394;<italic>vrn2-</italic>null lines in the presence of the functional <italic>VRN-A1</italic> allele.</p>

Day length was extended to 16 h with high pressure sodium lights. Tissues for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were collected at the same time (10:30 am) in all experiments to avoid potential confounding effects of circadian rhythms. Vernalization in this experiment was performed as described above.</p>
        <p>To study gene expression in the apices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003134-g005">Figure 5B and 5D</xref>), we collected apices from <italic>&#x394;vrn1-</italic>null mutants set 1 grown under long days in the greenhouse. Samples were collected before vernalization, six weeks after vernalization (4&#xB0;C) and two weeks after the plants were moved from the cold to room temperature. At each sampling point, 90 apices were harvested and pooled into three replicates including 30 apices per replicate.</p>
