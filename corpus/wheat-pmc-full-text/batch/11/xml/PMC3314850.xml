      <abstract>
        <p>Lower respiratory symptoms in bakery workers may be induced by wheat flour and endotoxins. We hypothesized that endotoxins from wheat flour may stimulate innate immunity and that interleukin-18 (<italic>IL</italic>-18) gene polymorphisms may affect their regulatory role in innate immune responses to endotoxins. To investigate the genetic contribution of <italic>IL</italic>-18 to sensitization to wheat flour, we performed a genetic association study of <italic>IL</italic>-18 in Korean bakery workers. A total of 373 bakery workers undertook a questionnaire regarding work-related symptoms. Skin prick tests with common and occupational allergens were performed and specific antibodies to wheat flour were measured by ELISA. Three polymorphisms of the <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene (-607A/C, -137G/C, 8674C/G) were genotyped, and the functional effects of the polymorphisms were analyzed using the luciferase reporter assay. Genotypes of -137G/C (GC or CC) and haplotype <italic>ht3</italic> [ACC] showed a significant association with the rate of sensitization to wheat flour. Luciferase activity assay indicated <italic>ht3</italic> [AC] as a low transcript haplotype. In conclusion, the regulatory role of <italic>IL</italic>-18 in lipopolysaccharide-induced responses in bakery workers may be affected by this polymorphism, thus contributing to the development of sensitization to wheat flour and work-related respiratory symptoms.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Baker's asthma is a common occupational respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). According to an epidemiological study on baker's asthma in a Korean population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), the prevalence of work-related upper and lower respiratory symptoms is 17.1%. Wheat flour is thought to be a major allergen that induces IgE sensitization and leads to the development of respiratory symptoms and asthma in bakery workers. A fair amount of bacterial endotoxins or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are found in wheat flour, may also provoke airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>IL-18 is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes Th1 or Th2 immune responses depending on the surrounding cytokine micromilieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Functional dysregulation of IL-18 production may contribute to the development of bronchial asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Moreover, IL-18 plays an important role in the beneficial and lethal LPS responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A recent study also demonstrated the role of IL-18 in homeostatic control of innate immune responses to the lethal inflammation of endotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because the regulatory role of IL-18 in innate immunity is provoked by endotoxins of wheat flour in the bakery workplace, we investigated the association between <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene polymorphisms and work-related lower respiratory symptoms and sensitization to flour allergens in bakery workers. To clarify the role of IL-18 in the development of baker's asthma, we examined functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-607A/C, -137G/C, 8674C/G) involved in the transcriptional regulation of IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Study subjects</title>
        <p>In total, 373 bakery workers who participated in a questionnaire survey regarding work-related respiratory symptoms were enrolled from a single industrial site. The questions regarding respiratory symptoms included whether subjects had experienced upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal itching, runny nose, sneezing, or congestion, as well as lower respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum, shortness of breath or wheezing. The subjects who indicated that their symptoms were aggravated during the work, but improved after the work or during holidays were defined as having work-related respiratory symptoms. All bakery workers were given a skin prick test (SPT) that included common inhalant allergens (Bencard, Bretford, UK) and wheat flour allergen extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Atopy was defined for subjects with more than one positive response to common inhalant allergens on the SPT. The total IgE concentration was measured using a UniCAP system (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of a specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies to wheat flour was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Clinical demographies of all study subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. All subjects were classified according to their dust exposure density as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and characterized by prevalence of sensitization rate to wheat flour and inflammatory cytokines in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>IL-18 SNP genotyping</title>
        <p>Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood samples of all participants using a Puregene DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genotyping of -607A/C (rs1946518) and -137G/C (rs187238) was performed using the SNaPshot assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (ABI PRISM SNaPshot Multiplex Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Genotyping of 8674C/G (rs5744247) was screened using the TaqMan fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay (Applied Biosystems). Nucelotide sequence information on primers used for SNP genotyping are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. Linkage disequilibrium between all pairs of biallelic loci was measured using Lewontin's D'(|D'|) and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p>

        <p>The 752-bp fragment of the promoter of the human <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene, including -607A/C and -137G/C, was prepared by PCR amplification using each haplotype (<italic>ht1</italic> [CG], <italic>ht2</italic> [AG], and <italic>ht3</italic> [AC]) human genomic DNA as templates using a pair of primers (forward primer, 5'-CTGAATTTTGGTATCCCTCTCCC-3'; reverse primer, 5'-GGAGACAATTCCTTGCTGACTG-3'). Each of the PCR products was gel purified using an agarose-gel purification kit (iNtRON, Daejeon, Korea) and ligated into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). These DNA plasmids were then cut with <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction enzymes (Takara, Shuzo, Japan) and ligated into the <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Xho</italic>I site of the pGL3-Basic Luciferase Reporter Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using T4 DNA ligase (Elpis Biotech, Daejeon, Korea). All constructs were verified by direct sequencing. DNA plasmids were prepared from these constructs using the Endo Free Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and then analyzed for quantity and integrity using UV spectrometry and agarosegel electrophoresis.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the clinical demographics of study subjects. The mean age of the 373 workers was 35 &#xB1; 7.7 yr, and the mean working period in the bakery was 4 &#xB1; 3.5 yr. Atopy was detected in 34.6% of the subjects. Of the 373 workers, 51 (13.7%) complained of work-related lower respiratory symptoms, including cough, sputum, shortness of breath, or wheezing. The prevalence of wheat flour sensitization was 6.3% using the SPT and 6.4% by the presence of IgE specific to wheat flour. When the workers were categorized into three groups based on the extent of exposure to flour dust (low: 0.01 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, intermediate: 1.16 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, high: 3.04 mg/m<sup>3</sup>), in accordance with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), serum IL-18 levels showed a significant rise with increased intensity of exposure to wheat flour (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, data not shown).</p>

The prevalence of IgG specific to wheat flour increased with increasing intensity of exposure to wheat flour dust.

        <title>Genotype and haplotype frequencies of IL-18 polymorphisms in bakery workers</title>
        <p>Three functional SNPs (-607A/C; rs1946518, -137G/C; rs187238, 8674C/G; rs5744247) were targeted in this study. The magnitude of LD between <italic>IL</italic>-18 SNPs, -137G/C and 8674C/G, showed a high value, with a pairwise LD value of D' = 1 and r<sup>2</sup> = 0.569. Among three SNPs of the <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene, the promoter polymorphisms at -137G/C showed a significant association with the rate of sensitization to wheat flour by the SPT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). The variant genotype (GC or CC) frequency of the -137G/C polymorphism was significantly higher in the positive SPT to wheat flour compared to that of the wild-type genotype (GG) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Among the three haplotypes, haplotype 3, <italic>ht3</italic> [ACC], showed a higher positive SPT to wheat flour (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005). The significance remained after multiple corrections. When we compared serum IL-18 levels according to <italic>IL</italic>-18 polymorphisms in bakery workers, -607C/A and haplotype 1, <italic>ht1</italic> [CGC], showed an association with increased serum IL-18 levels.</p>

        <title>Functional effects of IL-18 polymorphisms on transcriptional activity</title>
        <p>For analysis of the functional variability of the two promoter SNPs (-607A/C and -137G/C), three plasmid constructs of the <italic>IL</italic>-18 promoter containing two SNPs, <italic>ht1</italic> [CG], <italic>ht2</italic> [AG], and <italic>ht3</italic> [AC] were cloned into pGL3-Basic with a firefly luciferase gene reporter. The luciferase activities of <italic>ht1</italic> [CG], which contains the -607 C allele, were significantly elevated compared to those of <italic>ht2</italic> [AG] and <italic>ht3</italic> [AC], which exhibit the -607A allele in two different airway epithelial cell lines (A549 and BEAS2B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The variant genotype (AC or CC) of -607A/C also showed a significant association with serum IL-18 level; however, other SNPs (-137G/C; 8674C/G) were not associated (data not shown). These findings indicate that the -607 C allele may be important in transcriptional regulation of the <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Bakery workers exposed to endotoxins of wheat flour, including contaminated LPS, can initiate innate immunity. We hypothesized that IL-18 may affect the innate immunity provoked by endotoxins of wheat flour in the bakery workplace and that polymorphisms in the <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene may interfere with the regulatory role of IL-18.</p>
      <p>Innate immunity initiated by LPS can progress under controlled regulation, which appears to be dependent on the exposure dose of LPS in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). LPS can provoke a controlled antibacterial host defense program in a low dose, whereas it can induce lethal inflammatory reactions in a high dose when IL-18 may play a regulatory role in innate immunity. At lower doses of LPS, stimulation of reversible IL-18 expression enhanced antibacterial host defenses, while at higher doses of LPS, stimulation of a progressive, irreversible increase in IL-18 levels induced lethal inflammation. These findings indicate that the interactive network between LPS and IL-18 may affect innate immunity.</p>
      <p>There has been a report showing increased level of IL-18 in nasal lavage fluid after the inhalation challenge test with flour allergen in bakers with flour-induced occupational airway allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This finding suggests an active involvement of IL-18 in persistent allergic inflammation found in baker's asthma.</p>
      <p>When we checked serum IL-18 levels in bakery workers, increased serum IL-18 levels were found in accordance with increased intensities of exposure to wheat flour. This indicates that serum IL-18 levels may be affected by wheat flour dust in which LPS may be involved. Genetic association studies performed as part of this study demonstrated a significant association between the genotype of -137G/C (GC or CC) and haplotype <italic>ht3</italic> [ACC] with the rate of sensitization to wheat flour. Bakery workers carrying the -137GC or CC genotype had a tendency for higher serum-specific IgE antibodies to wheat flour, although the significance was not statistically meaningful. This finding indicates that genotyping of the <italic>IL</italic>-18 gene polymorphism and SPT to wheat flour may be applied to predict work-related respiratory symptoms in bakery workers.</p>
      <p>Functional dysregulation of IL-18 related to polymorphisms has been addressed in bronchial asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Examination of IL-18 production according to two promoter polymorphisms, -607C/A and -137G/C, demonstrated that alleles -607C and -137G are associated with an increase of IL-18 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). A cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element protein (CREB) at the -607 position and a histone 4 transcription factor-1 (H4TF-1) nuclear factor at the -137 position were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation of IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This finding was replicated in this study when we compared serum IL-18 level according to IL-18 polymorphisms in bakery workers. As Harada et al. reported that 8674C/G (rs5744247) showed higher transcriptional activity and was significantly correlated with serum IL-18 levels in Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), another functional SNP located in intron 1 was also investigated in this study. A comparison of serum IL-18 levels according to IL-18 polymorphisms in bakery workers demonstrated that -607C/A polymorphisms and the haplotype 1 <italic>ht1</italic> [CGC] affect serum IL-18 levels, which is in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>These findings suggest that alterations of IL-18 caused by genetic variants may affect the regulatory role of IL-18 in innate immunity initiated by endotoxins from wheat flour dust, finally leading to increased sensitization to wheat flour.</p>
