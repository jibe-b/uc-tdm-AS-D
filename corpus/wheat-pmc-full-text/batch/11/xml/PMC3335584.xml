        <p>Fusarium Ear Blight is a destructive fungal disease of cereals including wheat and can contaminate the crop with various trichothecene mycotoxins. This investigation has produced a new <italic><italic>&#x3B2;</italic></italic>-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter strain that facilitates the quick and easy assessment of plant infection. The constitutively expressed <italic>gpdA:GUS</italic> strain of <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> was used to quantify the overall colonisation pattern. Histochemical and biochemical approaches confirmed, in susceptible wheat ear infections, the presence of a substantial phase of symptomless fungal growth. Separate analyses demonstrated that there was a reduction in the quantity of physiologically active hyphae as the wheat ear infection proceeded. A simplified linear system of rachis infection was then utilised to evaluate the expression of several <italic>TRI</italic> genes by RT-qPCR. Fungal gene expression at the advancing front of symptomless infection was compared with the origin of infection in the rachis. This revealed that <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression was maximal at the advancing front and supports the hypothesis that the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol plays a role in inhibiting plant defences in advance of the invading intercellular hyphae. This study has also demonstrated that there are transcriptional differences between the various phases of fungal infection and that these differences are maintained as the infection proceeds. </p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Fusarium Ear Blight (FEB) disease also referred to as Fusarium head scab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scabusa.org">http://www.scabusa.org</ext-link>) is a destructive fungal disease that has the potential to devastate wheat, barley, rye, oat, or maize crops just weeks before harvest. All of the major wheat producing countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org">http://faostat.fao.org</ext-link>) have reported serious and repeated FEB outbreaks in the past decade, making the impact of <italic>Fusarium </italic>infections a global issue. This worldwide re-emergence is believed to be driven by changes in climate and agronomic practices. CIMMYT describes FEB as a major limiting factor to wheat production across the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Over the last 10 years, the average FEB incidence in UK wheat fields was 39% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cropmonitor.co.uk">http://www.cropmonitor.co.uk</ext-link>). <italic>Fusarium graminearum </italic>(teleomorph <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic>) is a filamentous ascomycete and one of the main causal agents of FEB throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Besides dramatically reducing yield, grain quality is affected through the selective loss of albumin and gluten proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The grains harvested from an infected crop are also contaminated with various fungal mycotoxins often making them unsuitable and/or unsafe for human consumption, animal feed, or malting purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Farmers in the UK pay the mill, where their grain is processed, to test for the presence of the type B trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and determine that the levels are below the EU safety guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgca.com">http://www.hgca.com</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Approximately one infected ear per square metre of the crop would be sufficient for grain found to contain DON to be rejected.</p>
      <p>During anthesis, the anthers naturally split to release pollen, which provides an opening for the pathogen to enter the wheat plant. Anther extrusion also exposes the poorly defended inner surface of the floral brackets, which can be penetrated directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To initiate the disease cycle, ascospores and asexual conidia are either rain splashed or wind dispersed, onto the floral tissues of the wheat crop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, epidemics on wheat occur when warm and moist weather conditions coincide with flowering. Infection of the individual florets within each spikelet then occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Once within the spikelet's rachilla, fungal hyphae advance in the intercellular spaces between live wheat cells. Macroscopically, the wheat ear tissue colonised appears symptomless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the early stages of infection, this symptomless growth represents the majority of the colonised tissue. Plant cells then die prior to, or at the same time as, the onset of intracellular colonisation by the pathogen, and this plant cell death coincides with the onset of externally visible disease symptoms on the wheat ears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At the later phases of infection, ascogenous hyphae form just below the wheat cell surface layers in preparation for later perithecial formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>F. graminearum </italic>produces a range of sesquiterpenoid mycotoxins including several type B trichothecenes, such as DON and its acetylated derivatives 15A-DON and 3A-DON, which are required for full virulence on wheat ears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. DON inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotes and prevents polypeptide chain initiation or elongation by binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The first committed step in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes is the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichodiene, which is catalysed by the trichodiene synthase enzyme coded for by the <italic>TRI5 </italic>gene. The role of DON in pathogenicity has been examined via the construction and use of non-DON producing <italic>tri5</italic> gene deficient mutants. The absence of mycotoxin production during wheat ear infection results in an enhanced plant defence response in the form of plant cell wall thickening which impedes rachis colonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, DON has also been implicated in the activation of several wheat defence responses including hydrogen peroxide production and programmed cell death which may aid colonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>The identification and evaluation of symptomless infection in wheat ears via light and electron microscopy is time consuming and costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this study, we created a transgenic <italic>F. graminearum</italic> reporter strain, that expresses the <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-glucuronidase enzyme (GUS) driven by the constitutive glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from <italic>Aspergillus nidulans </italic>(<italic>gpdA</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This reporter strain enabled the rapid evaluation of symptomless infection throughout the fungal colony in the ear. We then explored the expression of various <italic>Fusarium TRI </italic>genes during the early symptomless and symptomatic phases of wild-type infection by reverse transcriptase&#x2014;quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. This investigation of the infection of a susceptible wheat genotype by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> has (1) correlated the presence of fungal RNA with observed fungal colonisation at the cellular level; (2) compared fungal gene expression at the advancing front of symptomless infection with the origin of infection in the rachis; (3) revealed that the expression of several <italic>TRI</italic> genes is maximal at the advancing front; (4) shown that the centre of the <italic>Fusarium </italic>colony within the wheat ear has only minimal physiologically active hyphae. Overall, this study has shown that there are distinct phases to the <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection within the developing wheat ears and that these phases are maintained as infection proceeds.</p>

        <title>2.1. The Transformed Constitutive GUS Expressing Strain Exhibits a Wild-Type Phenotype</title>
        <p>Post co-transformation the <italic>in vitro</italic> colorimetric GUS assay confirmed that 38% of the selected hygromycin resistant transformants also contained the <italic>gpdA</italic>:<italic>GUS </italic>reporter construct (data not shown). A transformant which demonstrated a stable high level of GUS activity when grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) broth was identified by using the quantitative 4-methylumbelliferyl-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-D-glucuronide (MUG) assay. Transformant G3 produced 1153&#x2009;nmol&#x2009;MU&#x2009;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2009;mg protein<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> StD &#xB1; 165&#x2009;nmol&#x2009;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> using standard assay conditions. This transformant showed wild-type growth rates on a minimal (SNA) and rich (PDB) media and wild-type asexual and sexual sporulation after growth under near UV/white light on either SNA or carrot agar. Measurement of mean DON concentration by ELISA after growth on DON inducing corn meal agar showed DON production was unaltered (PH-1 (1.6&#x2009;ppm), G3 (1.5&#x2009;ppm), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Fisher <italic>F</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05)).</p>

        <title>2.2. The Constitutive GUS Strain Shows Wild-Type Pathogenicity</title>
        <p>The high levels of GUS produced by the G3 strain allowed the infection process to be followed by dissection and histochemical staining at 8 and 12 days post inoculation (dpi). The specificity of macroscopic GUS staining was confirmed to localise to the fungal hyphae (see Supplementary Figure 1 in Supplementary Material available online at doi: 10.4061/2011/626345). Staining at 8&#x2009;dpi revealed hyphae had colonised beyond the visible disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By 12&#x2009;dpi, hyphae had grown throughout the entire rachis below the inoculated spikelet and down into the peduncle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The fluorescent MUG assay is a more sensitive method to quantify fungal infection. The extent of infection varied significantly between individual wheat ears, typically by 2 spikelets by day 8 and 4 spikelets by day 16. Subsequently, representative ears were evaluated separately, and these results are presented. All spikelets on wheat ears were individually assessed at 8 and 16&#x2009;dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Combined with the histochemical staining, substantial symptomless colonisation continually advanced the infection throughout the wheat ear, relative to the progression of visible disease in that ear. The MUG assay also confirmed that some of the severely bleached spikelets towards the tip of the ear late in infection commonly lacked GUS activity and therefore remained noninfected. Interestingly, on occasions individual spikelets on fully disease ears appeared healthy. For example, at 16&#x2009;dpi, one spikelet (no. 12) in an otherwise heavily diseased ear had developed no macroscopic disease symptoms. The MUG assay confirmed spikelet 12 to be free of fungal infection and demonstrated the reliability of the system to monitor accurately the progression of infection. Disease-free spikelets were identified on several of the inoculated ears and could be located at any position in the ear. It was also noted that overall there was a 15-fold reduction in total GUS activity between 8 and 16&#x2009;dpi throughout the spikelets of the ear (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). To determine if this was caused by a reduction in active fungal biomass and a redistribution of resources to the actively growing region of the colony as infection progresses, a detailed microscopic analysis of infected ears was carried out. This revealed that hyphae had indeed lost their cell content at the late time point, 12&#x2009;dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which would account for this reduction in GUS activity.</p>

        <title>2.3. The Identification of Fungal Hyphae at the Cellular Level Correlates with the Detection of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> RNA</title>
        <p>Colonisation of the rachis represented a simplified linear system for monitoring and quantifying the development of infection which leads to sequential spikelets becoming colonised. Within the rachis internodes, hyphae predominantly grow in one direction, enabling the accurate isolation of the advancing front of infection. The four rachis internodes below the inoculated spikelet were excised at 5&#x2009;dpi to determine the extent of the macroscopically visible symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The appearance of disease symptoms, in the excised rachis internodes (RI), was also evaluated at the cellular level (Supplementary Figure 2). No hyphae were detected in RI-4, the internode the furthest from the point of inoculation. The active front of infection was identified in RI-3 and consisted of a low number of intercellular hyphae in association with live cortical cells. RI-2 possessed a higher number of intercellular hyphae than RI-3, surrounding live plant cells. The internode closest to the point of inoculation, RI-1, where the rachis infection had begun, contained both inter- and intracellular hyphae. Plant cortical cells and vascular elements in the centre of this rachis internode were intracellularly colonised and dead. However, the infected cell types were surrounded by live sclerenchyma and epidermal cells, accounting for the slight appearance of macroscopically visible disease symptoms in this internode at 5&#x2009;dpi. </p>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from 15 pooled rachis internodes (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4), and post DNAase treatment a PCR analysis was done using intergenic primers designed to amplify only genomic DNA (gDNA). These checks confirmed the absence of DNA contamination (Supplementary Figure 4). In the first three rachis internodes below the point of inoculation, fungal RNA was identified via reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) using primers to the housekeeping genes <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>-actin and <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-tubulin (see below). This result correlated well with the observation of hyphal infection at the cellular level.</p>

        <title>2.4. <italic>TRI</italic> Gene Expression is Upregulated at the Active Hyphal Front of Symptomless Infection</title>
        <p>Five <italic>Fusarium </italic>genes from the <italic>TRI </italic>cluster, namely, <italic>TRI4</italic>,<italic> TRI5</italic>,<italic> TRI6</italic>,<italic> TRI9</italic>, and <italic>TRI14</italic>, along with two housekeeping genes, <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>-actin and <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-tubulin, were selected for analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Each <italic>TRI </italic>gene was screened by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for changes in transcript abundance and normalised for fungal biomass within the three colonised rachis internodes at 5&#x2009;dpi. These <italic>TRI </italic>genes were chosen due to their known involvement in pathogenesis, and mycotoxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For the 7&#x2009;dpi, six colonised rachis internodes were sampled from each wheat ear, while the analysis focussed only on the expression of <italic>Tri4</italic>, <italic>Tri5 </italic>and the two housekeeping genes. </p>
        <p>The initial analysis of 15 pooled ears revealed that, at 5&#x2009;dpi, the transcripts of all five <italic>TRI </italic>genes were detected at their highest level at the active hyphal front of infection and decreased as the distance from the advancing front of infection increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). All the <italic>TRI </italic>genes showed a greater than twofold change in abundance in RI-3 (symptomless infection front) compared to RI-1 (the onset of disease symptoms, origin of rachis infection). <italic>TRI5 </italic>expression was very low in RI-1 and exhibited a dramatic 11.90-fold increase in abundance between the RI-1 and the advancing hyphal front in the RI-3 tissue, reaching a modest expression level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). <italic>TRI4</italic>,<italic> TRI9</italic>, and <italic>TRI14 </italic>expression was substantially higher than <italic>TRI5</italic> in RI-1, whilst their increase in expression level was more modest in RI-3. Interestingly, the relative level of expression of <italic>TRI6</italic> was considerably lower than the four other <italic>TRI </italic>genes, namely, <italic>TRI4</italic>, <italic>TRI5</italic>, <italic>TRI9</italic>, and <italic>TRI14</italic>, throughout all rachis internodes.</p>
        <p>The later 7 dpi time point was studied in more detail and included 45 ears (3 pools of 15 ears). This time point was chosen to determine whether elevated <italic>TRI </italic>gene expression at the advancing front of infection was retained throughout the progression of infection. At 7&#x2009;dpi, the first two rachis internodes (RI-1 and RI-2) represented fully symptomatic infection, the following two (RI-3 and RI-4) harbour the onset of disease symptoms, while the final two colonised internodes (RI-5 and RI-6) represented symptomless infection. The <italic>TRI </italic>genes that had shown the highest level and the greatest change in expression, at 5&#x2009;dpi, were chosen for further analysis. The expression of <italic>TRI4 </italic>and <italic>TRI5</italic>, relative to fungal biomass, again was higher during symptomless infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). Within the fully symptomatic plant tissue, <italic>TRI </italic>gene expression was very low. The amount of fungal biomass demonstrated an inverse relationship to <italic>TRI </italic>gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>; Supplementary Figure 5).</p>

        <title>3.1. The Effectiveness of the Reporter Strain to Track <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> Infection</title>
        <p>Our objective was to create a <italic>F. graminearum</italic> reporter strain that would simplify the quantification of the progression of infection throughout the ear. The GUS reporter strain had wild-type growth rates, pathogenicity, and mycotoxin production. <italic>In planta </italic>experiments confirmed that the constitutive GUS expressing strain can be used to quantify fungal biomass within both the symptomatic- and symptomless-infected wheat tissue. Histochemical and biochemical analyses verified the presence of a substantial phase of symptomless growth ahead of disease symptoms, as previously noted by Brown et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, in this interaction, there is a considerable latent period between the tissue becoming infected and the development of macroscopically visible symptoms. These studies also showed that a spikelet(s) at the tip of the ear and in other locations can fail to become infected even though the ear is otherwise heavily diseased. The histochemical and microscopy analyses of sectioned tissues confirmed that GUS activity was detected within the <italic>Fusarium</italic> hyphae. Analysis of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection process using the constitutive GUS expressing strain revealed a considerable reduction in GUS activity at late time points in infection, which is believed to be caused, in part, by the reduction in physiologically active hyphae. It is currently unknown what triggers the increase in abundance of &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; hyphae in the later stages of infection of a susceptible wheat genotype. In various other host-pathogen interactions, when compatible interactions have been quantitatively analysed using fungal transformants that contained the <italic>gpdA</italic>:<italic>GUS </italic>reporter construct, a steady increase in the levels of detectable MUG activity over the time-course has usually been reported. For example, in the interaction between tomato leaves and the intercellularly growing biotroph <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> (recently renamed <italic>Passalora fulva</italic>), a 100-fold increase in detectable MUG activity was observed over the 12-day time course prior to the onset of sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The final developmental stage in the <italic>Fusarium</italic>-wheat ear infection process is sporulation and the redistribution of resources to areas of sporulation may concentrate activity to these regions of the colony. </p>
        <p>In the <italic>Fusarium-</italic>wheat floral interaction, several major quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Using this new <italic>F. graminearum</italic> GUS reporter strain and the now available near-isogenic germplasm, it should be possible to evaluate, quantitatively, the kinetics of biomass accumulation associated with the presence/absence of each QTL in different wheat backgrounds. This should reveal whether the various genetic sources of either type 1 or type 2 resistance differentially influence the rate of loss of viable <italic>Fusarium </italic>hyphae. The constitutive GUS expressing transformant could be particularly informative in this regard because its use should simplify the identification of the onset of the formation of &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; hyphae and/or reductions in fungal biomass conferred by the different QTLs when present in various wheat backgrounds. Also, the ability to stain entire wheat ears and then to slice vertically to visualise the entire internal infection process using light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) will greatly assist the evaluation of wheat germplasm for the extent of symptomless infection compared to the macroscopically visible disease symptoms present. This relatively rapid procedure could be used to eliminate lines which supported predominantly symptomless infections. Overall, the GUS reporter strain provides a higher throughput system to accurately quantify physiologically active infection by easy histochemical and biochemical means, compared to the alternative fluorescent reporter proteins which require the use of confocal microscopy and a higher level of training.</p>

        <title>3.2. Mycotoxin Production during the Early Phases of Infection</title>
        <p>The early infection process was explored further using the simplified linear rachis internode system and RT-qPCR to determine the expression of various <italic>Fusarium </italic>genes required for mycotoxin production. <italic>TRI </italic>gene expression was found to be maximal at the hyphal front at both 5 and 7 days post spikelet inoculation. This indicates that the mycotoxin induction pattern is maintained as the hyphal advance symptomlessly through newly colonised wheat tissue. In addition to the upregulation of trichothecene biosynthetic genes (<italic>TRI4</italic>,<italic> TRI5</italic>, and <italic>TRI9</italic>), these quantitative analyses also revealed the elevated transcription of <italic>TRI</italic> gene regulators <italic>TRI6 </italic>and <italic>TRI14</italic>, at the advancing front of infection. Deletion of the <italic>TRI6 </italic>gene, which codes for a transcription factor, downregulates more than 200 genes, including most <italic>TRI </italic>genes and many genes from the preceding isoprenoid pathway, resulting in a reduction in DON production and pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, a <italic>F. graminearum TRI14 </italic>deletion strain demonstrated wild-type DON production <italic>in vitro</italic> while losing the ability to produce DON <italic>in planta</italic> resulting in a reduction in pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The combination of these results implies that <italic>TRI6 </italic>and <italic>TRI14</italic> regulation of the <italic>TRI </italic>genes is essential for DON production and pathogenesis during establishment of symptomless wheat ear infections. Expression of all of the <italic>TRI </italic>genes was minimal in the symptomatic wheat tissue within which an abundance of <italic>Fusarium </italic>hyphae are associated with dead plant cells. This suggests that, for this phase of the infection process, DON production is either not required or the tissue already contains considerable DON because of the earlier colonisation. </p>
        <p>The mycotoxin, DON, and its acetylated derivatives, produced by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> during infection of susceptible wheat, have been demonstrated to be essential for the spread of infection beyond the inoculated spikelet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For wheat cultivar Bobwhite and the sequenced <italic>F. graminearum </italic>strain PH-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], this result has been verified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the absence of DON production, symptomless infection is lost and the wheat plant is able to lay down a defensive barrier which appears as a brown ring around the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The production of DON may therefore inhibit the defensive response of plant cells in the vicinity of invading hyphae, minimising the onset of various cell wall reinforcement processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] by preventing protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This strategy would assist <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection. Indeed, previous detailed microscopic analyses revealed minimal changes to the appearance of wheat cortical cells surrounding the advancing DON-producing <italic>Fusarium</italic> hyphae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For DON production to be relatively uniform throughout the plant tissue at an early stage in the infection, the limited number of intercellular hyphae at the actively advancing front of symptomless infection would need to produce a higher amount of DON per fungal cell compared to fungal cells further into the colony where the ratio of fungal cells to live plant cells is consistently higher. Accordingly, once the plant cells have died, DON production would no longer be required.</p>
