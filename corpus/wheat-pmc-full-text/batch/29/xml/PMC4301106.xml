        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin with a high propensity for recurrence and metastasis. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes the majority of MCC cases due to the expression of the MCPyV small and large tumor antigens (ST and LT, respectively). Although a number of molecular mechanisms have been attributed to MCPyV tumor antigen-mediated cellular transformation or replication, to date, no studies have investigated any potential link between MCPyV T antigen expression and the highly metastatic nature of MCC. Here we use a quantitative proteomic approach to show that MCPyV ST promotes differential expression of cellular proteins implicated in microtubule-associated cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that MCPyV ST expression promotes microtubule destabilization, leading to a motile and migratory phenotype. We further highlight the essential role of the microtubule-associated protein stathmin in MCPyV ST-mediated microtubule destabilization and cell motility and implicate the cellular phosphatase catalytic subunit protein phosphatase 4C (PP4C) in the regulation of this process. These findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism for the highly metastatic phenotype associated with MCC.</p>
        <p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes the majority of cases of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive skin cancer with a high metastatic potential. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to virally induced cancer development have yet to be fully elucidated. In particular, no studies have investigated any potential link between the virus and the highly metastatic nature of MCC. We demonstrate that the MCPyV small tumor antigen (ST) promotes the destabilization of the host cell microtubule network, which leads to a more motile and migratory cell phenotype. We further show that MCPyV ST induces this process by regulating the phosphorylation status of the cellular microtubule-associated protein stathmin by its known association with the cellular phosphatase catalytic subunit PP4C. These findings highlight stathmin as a possible biomarker of MCC and as a target for novel antitumoral therapies.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin tumor (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The reported cases of MCC have tripled in the past 20 years in both Europe and the United States (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), due to an increase in known risk factors&#x2014;UV exposure, immune suppression, and increased age (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The cancer is characterized by significant incidence of local recurrence, early involvement of local lymph nodes, and distant metastasis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As such, MCC has a poor 5-year survival rate, due to its high propensity to metastasize (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is clonally integrated in &#x223C;80% of MCC tumors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). MCPyV encodes both large and small T antigens (LT and ST, respectively), which are regulatory proteins required for viral replication and tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). MCPyV infection and integration occur prior to expansion and metastasis of the tumor (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and truncation mutations of the LT gene are observed in the integrated genome rendering the virus replication defective (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). LT and ST are required for MCC cell survival and proliferation, as depletion of these T antigens leads to cell arrest and death of MCPyV-positive MCC cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In contrast to simian virus 40 (SV40), MCPyV ST is sufficient to transform rodent cells to anchorage- and contact-independent growth and also induces serum-free proliferation of human cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the exact contribution of ST to MCC cell growth is under debate as several ST depletion studies have shown differential dependence for MCC proliferation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Recent analyses suggest that MCPyV ST is multifunctional in nature (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). MCPyV ST leads to the hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1, resulting in the deregulation of cap-dependent translation, (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), it targets the cellular ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Fwb7</sup>, stabilizing MCPyV LT and several cellular oncoproteins (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and also functions as an inhibitor of NF-&#x3BA;B-mediated transcription (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although these interactions are attributed to either MCPyV ST-mediated cellular transformation or MCPyV replication processes, to date, no studies have investigated any potential link between MCPyV T antigen expression and the highly metastatic nature of MCC. This is of significant importance as dissemination and metastasis correlate with poor MCC survival rates (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite the clinical importance, the molecular basis by which cancer cells acquire the capability to migrate from the primary tumor remains to be fully elucidated (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). What is clear is that cell motility, migration, and invasion are critical factors regulating dissemination (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The importance of the actin cytoskeletal network in cell motility and migration has since been established (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and in recent years, it has become evident that the microtubule network also has an important role in facilitating cell motility and migration (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
      <p>Microtubules are essential components of the cytoskeleton and play a crucial role in a variety of cellular functions from the positioning of organelles, providing tracts for long distance transport, to ensuring the correct and timely segregation of chromosomes during mitosis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x2013;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, the microtubule network is central in controlling cell shape and polarized cell motility (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Microtubules are composed of &#x3B1;&#x3B2;-tubulin heterodimers, which self-assemble and disassemble, allowing transitions between microtubule growth and microtubule shrinkage or catastrophe (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This dynamic process is regulated by microtubule-stabilizing and -destabilizing proteins (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). One such microtubule-associated protein (MAP) is stathmin, also known as oncoprotein-18 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">&#x2013;</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In its unphosphorylated form, stathmin binds and sequesters tubulin dimers, forming a T<sub>2</sub>S complex and thereby reducing the substrate for growing microtubule polymers, thus indirectly leading to microtubule destabilization. In contrast, phosphorylation of stathmin at one or more serine residues weakens the tubulin-binding ability of stathmin and increases free tubulin concentrations for microtubule assembly (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>
      <p>Stathmin overexpression is a feature of multiple cancer types and correlates with poor prognosis and high metastatic potential (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). As such, alterations in the microtubule network by stathmin deregulation play a crucial role in cell motility, migration, and invasion. This is supported by RNA interference (RNAi) studies showing that a reduction in stathmin correlates with reduced cell migration in various cancers (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">&#x2013;</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Moreover, regulation of the phosphorylation status of stathmin can affect its microtubule-destabilizing activity and transforming potential (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Together these observations highlight an important link between stathmin, microtubule dynamics, and cell motility in cancer.</p>
      <p>Herein we utilized quantitative proteomics to examine the effect of MCPyV ST on the host cell proteome. Intriguingly MCPyV ST promotes differential expression of cellular proteins implicated in microtubule-associated cytoskeletal organization and dynamics, leading to a motile and migratory phenotype. Specifically, we demonstrate that stathmin is required for MCPyV ST-mediated microtubule destabilization and cell motility. Moreover, regulation of this process involves the cellular phosphatase catalytic subunit protein phosphatase 4C (PP4C).</p>

        <title>MCPyV ST affects microtubule network regulatory proteins.</title>
        <p>To analyze the effect of MCPyV ST expression on the cellular proteome, SILAC-based quantitative proteomics was performed utilizing a 293 Flp-In cell line capable of inducible MCPyV ST expression, termed i293-ST (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The i293-ST line is a robust model for this analysis, as inducible levels of MCPyV ST are representative of ST expression in an MCPyV-positive MCC cell line, MKL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) highlighted that a significant proportion of the highly differentially expressed proteins were implicated in gene ontology groupings involving microtubule-associated cytoskeletal organization and dynamics (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), which is the focus of this study. Figure S2 in the supplemental material summarizes the differential expression of proteins associated with other gene ontology groupings.</p>

        <p>Of particular interest was the dramatic upregulation (8.33-fold) of the microtubule-associated protein stathmin, a critical factor for microtubule dynamics (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Stathmin is overexpressed in many human cancers and is implicated in clinical characteristics such as tumor grade, size, and prognosis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). To confirm that stathmin and a selection of other proteins associated with microtubule dynamics were altered upon MCPyV ST expression, immunoblotting was performed comparing uninduced and induced i293-ST cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The results show an increase in the levels of expression of the microtubule-associated proteins upon MCPyV ST expression and support the quantitative proteomic analysis.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the differential expression of stathmin with regard to MCC, multicolor immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of primary MCC tumors. Sections were incubated with cytokeratin 20 (CK20) (a marker widely used to distinguish MCC) and stathmin-specific antibodies. An isotype-matched control was also used as a negative control. The results show demonstrably higher levels of stathmin expression coincident with CK20 staining in regions of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These data suggest that MCC tumor cells express increased levels of stathmin. In addition, multicolor immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on FFPE sections of two further MCC tumors to determine the potential correlation between stathmin expression levels and MCPyV positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Sections were stained as described above but were also incubated with an MCPyV LT-specific antibody. The results again show abundant levels of stathmin expression coincident with CK20 staining in both MCC tumors; however, interestingly, LT expression was much weaker in one of the tumors, suggesting that other mechanisms of stathmin upregulation may occur in MCC, including possible virus-independent mechanisms.</p>

        <title>MCPyV ST promotes cell motility, migration, and invasion.</title>
        <p>To assess whether MCPyV ST promotes a more motile and migratory cell phenotype due to the differential expression of microtubule-associated proteins, live cell imaging was performed using an Incucyte kinetic live cell imaging system comparing EGFP- with EGFP-ST-expressing 293 cells. We have previously shown that the EGFP fusion does not affect ST functioning (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Cells were imaged every 30 min over a 24-h period, and cell motility was tracked using Image J software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; see Movies S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). The results show line traces following the cell motility of 3 distinct cells, demonstrating that MCPyV ST leads to a statistically significant increase in cell motility. Moreover, imaging demonstrates that in contrast to EGFP-expressing cells, where cells grow in a colony, MCPyV ST-expressing cells rapidly dissociate from the colonies (as highlighted in the top right section of the movies in the supplemental material), suggesting a more motile and migratory phenotype. To confirm this observation, a scratch assay was performed comparing uninduced versus induced i293-ST cells. Cellular growth back was recorded every 24 h for a period of 3 days, and the results indicate that, in contrast to uninduced cells, MCPyV ST enhanced the motility and migration of cells, fully closing the wound at 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). To verify this enhanced motile and migratory phenotype, Matrigel and fibronectin-based Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed. HT1080 cells, an invasive human fibrosarcoma cell line, were used as a positive control. The results demonstrate that both induced i293-ST and EGFP-ST-expressing cells showed a significant increase in migration and invasive properties compared to uninduced or EGFP-expressing cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>MCPyV ST promotes microtubule destabilization.</title>
        <p>To investigate what effect MCPyV ST expression had upon stathmin subcellular localization, immunofluorescence studies were performed in MCC13 cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-ST, using a stathmin-specific antibody. The results show that endogenous stathmin has a diffuse cytoplasmic staining in EGFP-expressing cells. In contrast, upon MCPyV ST expression, stathmin is redistributed to a halo-like pattern around the nucleus, which colocalizes with a portion of MCPyV ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This cytoplasmic halo-like staining is indicative of a destabilized microtubule network (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). To determine if the stability of the microtubule network is altered upon MCPyV ST expression, immunofluorescence studies were repeated using a &#x3B2;-tubulin-specific antibody. In EGFP-transfected cells, &#x3B2;-tubulin highlighted the presence of a stable microtubule network, whereas in MCPyV ST-expressing cells, &#x3B2;-tubulin relocalized to a halo-like distribution, consistent with that of stathmin, indicating microtubule network destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

Although no overall change in microtubule levels was observed, as indicated by &#x3B2;-tubulin levels, a marked decrease in acetylated tubulin levels was observed upon MCPyV ST expression, indicating a decrease in stabilized microtubules. Moreover, we also assessed whether MCPyV ST affects the phosphorylation status of stathmin, using phospho-stathmin (Ser16) and stathmin-specific antibodies. The results showed increased stathmin expression, as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). However, importantly, the levels of phosphorylated stathmin decreased upon MCPyV ST expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>), suggesting that MCPyV ST leads to an increase in the pool of unphosphorylated stathmin, which in turn promotes microtubule destabilization.</p>

        <title>Microtubule destabilization is required for MCPyV ST-mediated cell motility.</title>
        <p>We next assessed if microtubule destabilization is essential for MCPyV ST-induced cell motility. The taxane-based drug paclitaxel binds microtubules, promoting polymerization and stability (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Therefore, immunofluorescence studies were conducted to determine whether paclitaxel inhibited MCPyV ST-induced microtubule destabilization. Paclitaxel treatment had no effect on the stable microtubule network in EGFP-expressing MCC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), resembling EGFP-expressing cells alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, paclitaxel inhibited EGFP-ST-mediated microtubule destabilization previously observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, since in the presence of the drug, distinctive bundles of microtubules were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). To determine if prevention of MCPyV ST-induced microtubule destabilization affects cell motility and migration, scratch assays were performed comparing MCC13 cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) in the absence and presence of paclitaxel. The results observed in the absence of paclitaxel were similar to those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, demonstrating that MCPyV ST enhances cell motility and migration. In contrast, in the presence of paclitaxel, EGFP-ST-transfected MCC13 cells migrate at the same speed as EGFP-expressing MCC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

        <title>Cellular phosphatases are required for MCPyV ST-mediated microtubule destabilization and cell motility.</title>
        <p>The results suggest that MCPyV ST increases the pool of unphosphorylated stathmin levels. As MCPyV ST interacts with multiple cellular phosphatase subunits, including PP2A A&#x3B1;, PP2A A&#x3B2;, and PP4C (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we assessed whether cellular phosphatases are required for microtubule destabilization and cell motility using two previously generated MCPyV ST mutants that fail to interact with PP2A A&#x3B1; (the R7A mutant) or PP4C and PP2A A&#x3B2; (the &#x394;95-111 mutant) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Importantly, these mutants still retain other MCPyV ST functions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). MCC13 cells expressing EGFP, EGFP-ST, EGFP-R7A, or EGFP&#x394;95-111 were stained with a &#x3B2;-tubulin-specific antibody to determine the presence of a stable microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). R7A (&#x394;PP2A A&#x3B1;) retained the ability to destabilize microtubules. Conversely, a stable microtubule network was evident in EGFP&#x394;95-111-expressing cells (&#x394;PP4C/PP2A A&#x3B2;). To confirm these observations, immunoblotting was performed with stathmin-, phosphorylated stathmin-, and acetylated tubulin-specific antibodies on MCC13 transfected cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Increased levels of phosphorylated stathmin and acetylated tubulin were observed in EGFP&#x394;95-111-expressing cells, compared to EGFP-ST- and EGFP-R7A-expressing cells, indicating increased microtubule stabilization. To test the requirement for cellular phosphatases in MCPyV ST-induced cell motility, scratch assays were performed with MCC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>) expressing EGFP, EGFP-ST, EGFP-R7A, or EGFP&#x394;95-111. The results demonstrate that cellular growth back was reduced in the EGFP&#x394;95-111-expressing compared to the EGFP-R7A- and MCPyV EGFP-ST-expressing cells. Together, the results suggest that PP4C and/or PP2A A&#x3B2; is required for MCPyV ST-induced cell motility and migration.</p>

        <p>Similar assays were also performed using wild-type or transdominant mutants of PP2A and PP4. PP2AcH118N, is a catalytically inactive transdominant mutant of the PP2A catalytic subunit (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), and PP4-RL is a phosphatase-dead mutant of PP4 (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The presence of a stable microtubule network was analyzed using a &#x3B2;-tubulin-specific antibody in MCC13 cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-ST in the presence of either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms of PP2A or PP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). The results show that expression of both wild-type cellular phosphatases had little effect on the ability of MCPyV ST to destabilize microtubules. However, upon expression of PP2AcH118N, destabilization of the microtubule network was evident in both control and MCPyV ST-expressing cells, suggesting that inhibition of PP2A activity induces microtubule destabilization (data not shown). This result has been previously observed (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and therefore no further conclusions on MCPyV ST function could be drawn using this mutant. In contrast, expression of PP4-RL had little effect on the microtubule network in control cells. Notably, however, a stable microtubule network was evident in MCPyV ST-expressing cells, suggesting that the PP4C transdominant mutant inhibited MCPyV ST-induced microtubule destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). To confirm these observations, immunoblotting was performed with stathmin-, phosphorylated stathmin-, and acetylated tubulin-specific antibodies on MCC13 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Similar to EGFP&#x394;95-111-expressing cells, increased levels of phosphorylated stathmin and acetylated tubulin were observed in the presence of the PP4C transdominant mutant compared to the wild-type construct in MCPyV ST-expressing cells. We next assessed the effect of PP4-RL expression on MCPyV ST-induced cell motility using scratch assays, comparing MCC13 cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-ST in the presence of wild-type or the catalytically inactive PP4C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>). The results demonstrate that cellular growth back was inhibited in MCPyV ST-expressing cells transfected with the catalytically inactive PP4C, in contrast to wild-type PP4C. Together the results implicate PP4C in MCPyV ST-induced microtubule destabilization and cell motility.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>MCPyV ST is an oncogenic protein (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Herein, we show that MCPyV ST leads to changes in cellular protein levels that regulate cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. Considering the highly metastatic nature of MCC, this suggests a possible link between MCPyV ST and cell motility and migration, essential factors for tumor cell dissemination. Indeed metastasis to distant sites correlates with poor MCC survival rates (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). MCC is effectively an accidental endpoint for MCPyV infection, due to the clonally integrated genome being unable to replicate. However, the promotion of metastasis by virus oncoproteins is not without precedent: a number of DNA viruses have been shown to induce metastasis by deregulating the normal processes of cellular adhesion and motility (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">&#x2013;</xref><xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p>
      <p>Stathmin is overexpressed in many cancer types (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), but its contribution to tumor development is still poorly understood. The link between stathmin, microtubule destabilization, and cell motility is supported by the use of two stathmin mutants that separate its tubulin-sequestering activity, which destabilizes microtubules, from its catastrophe-promoting ability (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). 3D Transwell migration and invasion assays overexpressing the wild type or the mutant containing the tubulin-sequestering activity dramatically decreased the amount of stable acetylated microtubules enhancing cell migration, in contrast to the catastrophe-promoting mutant (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to 3D matrices or <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, reports have suggested that in certain cell types, increased stathmin expression is insufficient to enhance cell motility in 2D time-lapse wound closure assays (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). This observation has yet to be fully elucidated but may be linked to distinct molecular mechanisms regulating cell morphology (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Expression of a less phosphorylated stathmin mutant can induce a rounded cell shape coupled with amoeboid-like protrusions, allowing enhanced movement using bleb-like propulsion mechanisms (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It may be the case that stathmin overexpression leads to a more flexible and dynamic microtubule network, inducing a switch in mechanisms that further regulate additional cell morphology changes. Notably, bioinformatic analysis identified gene ontology headers that included general cytoskeletal changes within the MCPyV ST proteomic data, and work is ongoing to determine whether additional changes to the host cell actin cytoskeleton are induced upon MCPyV ST expression.</p>
      <p>The results also suggest that the pool of unphosphorylated stathmin is increased upon MCPyV ST expression. To date, few cellular phosphatases have been implicated in the regulation of stathmin. Okadaic acid-mediated inhibition results in a major increase in the level of phosphorylation of stathmin (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), suggesting a possible role of protein phosphatases of types 1, 2A, and 2B. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> dephosphorylation assays showed differential patterns of site-specific dephosphorylation, suggesting stathmin phosphorylation is modulated by the sequential activity of multiple cellular phosphatases (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). MCPyV ST interacts with various cellular phosphatase subunits, and we highlight a likely role of PP4C in MCPyV ST-induced microtubule destabilization and cell motility. Interestingly, PP4C has been implicated in microtubule dynamics and is required for proper microtubule organization at the centrosome through regulation of NDEL1 and recruitment of katanin p60 (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).</p>
      <p>MCC is treated by surgical excision and radiotherapy, which can achieve loco-regional control, but a paucity of trials means no defined chemotherapy regime has proven effective for the metastatic disease. MCPyV may identify potential novel virus-targeted therapeutic regimens. For example, YM155, a small-molecule inhibitor of the survivin promoter, initiates cell death in virus-positive MCC cells and significantly delays MCC xenografts (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). MCPyV ST-induced microtubule destabilization may also be an avenue for further investigation. Taxanes are widely used in combination with other anticancer drugs to treat many different types of cancer and may be of therapeutic benefit for MCC, although the clinical utility of these microtubule inhibitors is often constrained by primary or acquired resistance. New microtubule-targeting agents that overcome taxane resistance provide additional options for treatment. The epothilones have activity against taxane-resistant cell lines and tumor xenografts (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Therefore, it would be interesting to determine if epothilones also have inhibitory effects on MCPyV ST-induced cell migration. Moreover, the upregulation of stathmin by MCPyV ST may also be a novel therapeutic target. Gene profiling of melanoma cells has identified stathmin as a potential target of miR-193b, and ectopic expression of miR-193b results in a decrease in stathmin and reduced migration of multiple melanoma cell lines (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). As such, RNAi-based therapies delivering miR-193 mimics or stathmin-specific siRNAs may prove powerful tools to inhibit metastatic MCC.</p>
      <p>In summary, we provide evidence that MCPyV ST promotes differential expression of cellular proteins implicated in cytoskeletal organization and dynamics leading to a motile and migratory phenotype. We demonstrate the essential role of stathmin in MCPyV ST-mediated microtubule destabilization and cell motility and implicate the cellular phosphatase catalytic subunit PP4C in the regulation of this process. These findings suggest a possible molecular explanation for the highly metastatic phenotype associated with MCCs and highlight stathmin as a possible biomarker of MCC prognosis and as a target for novel antitumoral therapies.</p>
