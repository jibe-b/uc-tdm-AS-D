      <abstract>
        <p>Many plants exhibit antioxidant properties which may be useful in the prevention of oxidative stress reactions, such as those mediated by the formation of free radical species in different pathological situations. In recent years a number of studies have shown that whole grain products in particular have strong antioxidant activity. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were used to investigate whether and how a fermented powder of wheat (Lisosan G) is able to modulate antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, and whether or not it can activate Nrf2 transcription factor or inhibit NF-kB activation. All of the antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes studied were significantly up-regulated by 0.7 mg/ml Lisosan G treatment. In particular, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and heme oxygenase-1 were induced, although to different degrees, at the transcriptional, protein and/or activity levels by the treatment. As for the Nrf2 transcription factor, a partial translocation of its protein from the cytosol to the nucleus after 1 h of Lisosan G treatment was revealed by immunoblotting. Lisosan G was also observed to decrease H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced toxicity</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results show that this powder of wheat is an effective inducer of ARE/Nrf2-regulated antioxidant and detoxifying genes and has the potential to inhibit the translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Humans are constantly exposed to factors causing oxidative stress including pollutants, radiation and oxidized food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Halliwell1">[1]</xref>. Oxidative stress, defined as a loss of balance between the cellular concentration of reactive oxygen species and the cell's antioxidant capacity, is implicated in the onset of various diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Valko1">[2]</xref>. The human body has several endogenous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Baublis1">[3]</xref> with which it can protect itself against oxidative stress, but antioxidant factors acquired from food also play a key role. Indeed, certain micronutrients obtained from food have potent antioxidant properties and may play an important role in maintaining the oxidative/antioxidative balance, especially if the diet is rich in these constituents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Weisburger1">[4]</xref>. In recent years, a variety of vegetables that contain antioxidants potentially capable of preventing oxidative stress reactions, such as those mediated by the formation of free radical species have been studied. Tomatoes, spinach, green peppers and cabbage are important sources of vitamin C. <italic>In vivo</italic>, this vitamin acts as scavenger of oxygen radicals and also as competitive inhibitor of nitrosamine synthesis from nitrite and amines <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Oliveira1">[5]</xref>. Isothiocyanates are a family of molecules which are abundant in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, watercress and cauliflower. Sulforaphane, the best known isothiocyanate, induces drug metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase A1/2 isoforms and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) in primary hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Payen1">[6]</xref>. Whole grains are good source of B group vitamins, vitamin E, some minerals (zinc, magnesium and phosphorous), and they contain a variety of phytochemicals such as phytoestrogens, phytate, proteins, polysaccharides, phenols and lignans that are able to minimize oxydive damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Venn1">[7]</xref>. All these components may act synergically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Slavin1">[8]</xref>. By contrast, refined grains have a reduced nutrient content as the milling process results in the loss of dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals, lignans, phytoestrogens, phenolic compounds and phytic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Slavin2">[9]</xref>. Many wheat proteins contain reduced sulfhydryl groups, which can have some free radical scavenging activity. Phytic acid can protect tissues against oxidative reactions by sequestering and inactivating pro-oxidative transition metals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Baublis1">[3]</xref>. In epidemiological studies, whole grain consumption is associated with improvements in body mass index (BMI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Gaesser1">[10]</xref> and insulin sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Steffen1">[11]</xref> as well as with lower incidences of type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-McKeown1">[12]</xref>, cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Flight1">[13]</xref>, and colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Randi1">[14]</xref>. Little is known about how cereals effect cells and to our knowledge, no research has yet been done on the antioxidant properties of whole grain products in primary hepatocytes.</p>
      <p>Several studies have shown that some phytochemicals can modulate antioxidant and phase II enzymes through the activation of nuclear factor E2-related protein (Nrf2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Xiang1">[15]</xref>. Nrf2 is a basic-leucine zipper transcription factor that under basal conditions, is present in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to the Kelch-like ECH- associated protein 1 (Keap1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Itoh1">[16]</xref>. Various agents including Antioxidant Response Element (ROS) and weak electrophiles (e.g. isothiocyanates) can alter the Keap1-Nrf2 protein complex and free Nrf2 through phosphorilation or alkylation of one or more of the 27 cysteine residues in Keap1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Alam1">[17]</xref>. When this occurs, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus. Upon activation, Nrf2 dimerizes with a small Maf protein then binds to antioxidant responsive element (ARE) sites in the promoter regions of antioxidant and phase II genes, thereby inducing their transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Buckley1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In recent years, many authors have suggested the existence of cross-talk between Nrf2/ARE and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathways in response to inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Lee1">[19]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Saw1">[21]</xref>. The Nrf2 and NF-kB signaling pathways interface at several points to control the transcription or function of downstream target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Wakabayashi1">[22]</xref>. In addition, ROS now appear to act as second messengers in numerous signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Curtin1">[23]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Storz1">[24]</xref>. One signaling pathway that engages in cross-talk with ROS involves NF-kB family transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Sakon1">[25]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Karin1">[27]</xref>. It had already been shown twenty years ago by Schreck and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Schreck1">[28]</xref> that oxidative stresses, such as addition of extracellular hydrogen peroxide, can induced NF-kB nuclear translocation in several cell lines. The NF-kB family is made up of NF-kB1 (p50), NFkB2 (p52), RelA (p65), c-Rel and RelB. In the absence of stimuli, NF-kB, is associated with the inhibitor protein, IkB&#x3B1;, and sequestered in the cytosol. Upon stimulation with a NF-kB inducers, IkB&#x3B1; is rapidly phosphorylated on two serine residues (S32 and S36), which targets the inhibitor for ubiquitination and degradation by proteosome.</p>
      <p>Lisosan G is a powder obtained from <italic>Triticum Sativum</italic> (wheat) and it is registered with the Italian Ministry of Health as a nutritional supplement. In the production process, the wholegrain is first ground to a rough powder. From this intermediary product, the bran and germ are separated and collected for further treatment which consists in the following: water is added to moisten the mix, then selected microbic starting cultures are inoculated to initiate fermentation. The starting cultures typically consist of a mix of lacto-bacillus and natural yeast strains. Once the product is sufficiently fermented, it is dried. The resulting dry powder is now Lisosan G, which is widely used in food production thanks to its rich nutritional content.</p>
      <p>It contains vitamins, minerals and polyunsatured fatty acids as well as having significant antioxidant activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Longo1">[29]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, Lisosan G protects against cisplatin induced toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Longo2">[30]</xref>, and a recent paper showed that Lisosan G helps prevent microcirculatory dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Lubrano1">[31]</xref>. The authors of these works suggested that the protective effect of Lisosan G could be associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress and the preservation of antioxidant enzymes. To date, no studies have attempted to identify the molecular mechanism that determines antioxidant properties of Lisosan G. For this reason, in the present study, we investigated the effects of Lisosan G on the antioxidant and drug-metabolising enzymes at transcriptional, catalytic and protein levels using cultures of primary rat hepatocytes.</p>

        <title>2.2 Primary rat hepatocytes isolation, culture and treatments</title>
        <p>Hepatocytes were isolated from 200&#x2013;300 g Wistar male rats with free access to drinking water and food and on a 12 h light/dark cycle. The research with the use of animals was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health in compliance with European Community law n. 116/92. The approved protocol number is 10/09. The animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneally injection of Zoletil &#xAE; (40 mg/kg) and then subjected to midline laparotomy in order to exteriorize the liver and isolate the portal vein. A needle was inserted into the portal vein and then the liver was perfused as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-DeSmet1">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>After filtration and centrifugation, the cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were dispersed in Williams E medium containing 39 ng/ml dexamethasone, 0.5 U/ml insulin, 0.007 &#xB5;g/ml glucagon, 5 &#xB5;g/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 5 &#xB5;g/ml ampicillin and kanamycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were plated at a density of 4.5&#xD7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/8 ml on 100 mm cell culture dish pre-coated with 3 ml of collagen (type I) solution (1 mg/ml). The cultures were maintained at 37&#xB0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidifier incubator. After 5 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free Williams E medium supplemented with 2% BSA, 7.5 &#xB5;g/ml hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate sodium salt and EGF 20 ng/ml. Cultures were maintained in this medium at 37&#xB0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 h. After this period, the medium was removed and a second layer of type I collagen was added to create a collagen-gel sandwich culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Beken1">[33]</xref> and after 45 minutes serum-free Williams E medium was added again. The cells were maintained for additional 24 h before treatments. Cells treatments were divided in four different groups: in the first group (control), the cells were treated with medium only; in the second one with Lisosan G 0.7 mg/ml (Lis); in the third group with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 200 &#xB5;M and in the last group, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 200 &#xB5;M was added after 1 h pre-treatment with Lisosan G 0.7 mg/ml (Lis+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). We have used different concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10&#x2013;500 &#xB5;M) and we chose 200 &#xB5;M (good toxicity); we also used for Lisosan G different concentrations from 0.1 to 2.8 mg/ml and 0.7 mg/ml was the best concentration in terms of maximum protective effect and without toxicity. The cytotoxic effects compared with the vehicle-only controls, was also measured by lactate dehydrogenase assay (data not shown). We have also performed experiments in function of time of treatments of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Lisosan G and we chose the time of treatment on the basis of the best results.</p>

        <p>In the next set of experiments, the effect of Lisosan G on antioxidant and phase II enzyme activity was evaluated in microsomes and the cytosol of control hepatocytes and hepatocytes treated for 24 h. The enzymes chosen were NQO1, HO-1, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment reduced NQO1 activity, but NQO1 activity remained high when a 1 hour pre-treatment with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083538-g003">fig. 3A</xref>) Lisosan G preceeded the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. It is interesting to note that Lisosan G alone caused an increase in NQO1 activity (about 1.5 fold of control value). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also caused a decrease in HO-1 activity compared to control cells, but pretreatment with Lisosan G before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment elevated the activity above the level of CTR. HO-1 activity was significantly induced by Lisosan G treatment (about 2.2 fold of control value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083538-g003">fig. 3B</xref>). As for GST, its activity decreased after the 24 h treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but pretreatment with Lisosan G restored it nearly to control values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083538-g003">fig. 3C</xref>). This phase II activity was induced to about 1.2 times the control value by the Lisosan G treatment.

        <p>As cross talk between Nrf2 and NF-kB is an area of intense interest, we investigated whether Lisosan G treatment would prevent the NF-kB translocation to the nucleus, caused by hydrogen peroxide. We analyzed the nuclear fraction by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083538-g007">fig. 7</xref>). NF-kB was distinctly induced in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated hepatocytes. The signal in control cells was similar to that of cells treated with Lisosan G, both very weak. The signal from nuclear extracts of hepatocytes treated with Lisosan G+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is fainter than that obtained in hydrogen peroxide treated cells. The results have been normalized to &#x3B2;-actin levels.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we investigated whether a fermentated wheat powder, Lisosan G, was able to protect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced oxidative stress and whether it was able to modulate phase 2 enzymes by activating the Nrf2 protein and causing its translocation into the nucleus. We also analyzed its ability to prevent NF-kB nuclear translocation. We used sandwich cultures of primary rat hepatocytes, a unique <italic>in vitro</italic> system that preserves hepatic cytomorphology, as well as its drug metabolism, deposition and toxicity, to allow close resemblance with <italic>in vivo</italic> parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Swift1">[47]</xref>. When cultured between two layers of gelled collagen, hepatocytes also retain their ability to form intact canalicular networks and they retain their polarized excretory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Dunn1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Lisosan G defended cells against damage induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> and increased NQO1, HO-1, GST and catalase activity, suggesting that Lisosan G has antioxidant properties and confirming earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> studies which had demonstrated the ability of Lisosan G to elevate GST, NQO1, catalase and GSH peroxidase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Longo1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Longo2">[30]</xref>. The induction of HO-1 represents an important event in adaptive cellular response to different oxidative stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Prawan1">[20]</xref>. Indeed, we detected an increase in HO-1 at the catalytic, transcriptional and protein level, both in response to Lisosan G treatment alone and to Lisosan G pretreatment followed by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced oxidative stress. Several classes of phytochemicals such as phenols, flavonoids, isothiocyanates, organosulfurs, and indoles can induce detoxifying enzymes such as NQO1 and HO-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Chen1">[49]</xref>. Curcumin, for example, was observed to exert hepatoprotective properties against ethanol-induced oxidative stress, via dose- and time-dependent induction of HO-1, in primary rat hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Bao1">[50]</xref>. We noticed that Lisosan G increased GSH levels both when used on its own and as pre-treatment before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. GSH is a multifunctional intracellular non-enzymatic antioxidant and it is considered to be the major thiol-disulphide redox buffer of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Masella1">[51]</xref>. The protective role of GSH against oxidative stress depends on the equilibrium between thiol reduced (GSH) and disulfide-oxidized forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Pastore1">[52]</xref>. Cellular GSH depletion has been found to be associated with decreased cell proliferation in vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Valko2">[53]</xref>. Since the level of GSH is an important factor in the protection of cells, we believe that Lisosan G has excellent cytoprotective ability.</p>
      <p>NQO1, HO-1 and GST gene expression is regulated by several key transcriptional factors located in the upstream region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Prawan1">[20]</xref>. We found that in rat hepatocytes the induction of these enzymes occurred through the activation of the Nrf2 protein and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. This mechanism has also been observed in hepatic cell lines in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Jeong1">[54]</xref>. In this paper, we have shown by immunoblotting that this fermented wheat powder was able to activate Nrf2 after just 1 h of treatment.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that the Nrf2 and NF-kB signaling pathways interface at several points to control the transcription or function of downstream target proteins. We therefore tried to understand if Lisosan G was able to regulate NF-kB. It is known that released NF-kB translocates into the nucleus where it regulates the transcription of genes for chemokines, cytokines, immunoreceptors, cell-adhesion molecules, growth factors, tumor necrosis factor &#x3B1; (TNF&#x3B1;), inducible NOS (iNOS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Gilmore1">[55]</xref>. Some phytochemicals can prevent the activation of NF-kB. Sulforaphane, for exemple, reduces the DNA binding of NF-kB in Raw 264.7 macrophages without affecting IkB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Heiss1">[56]</xref>. Several chemopreventive agents trigger Nrf2 signaling with a concomitant repression of NF-kB and its target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Wakabayashi1">[22]</xref>. Chalcone (a flavonoid) has been shown to induce Nrf2 while inhibiting the activation of NF-kB in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Liu1">[57]</xref>. 3H-1,2-Dithiole-3-thione reduces the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kB, and also induces changes in phosphorilation of IkB in rat hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Karuri1">[58]</xref>. Our results show that the hydrogen peroxide treatment increases the amount of NF-kB protein in nucleus and the pretreatment with Lisosan G decreased it.</p>
      <p>The ability of Lisosan G to induce phase II enzymes via Nrf2 and inhibit NF-kB activation, may be linked to its composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Longo1">[29]</xref>. Lisosan G contains has linoleic (20: 4n-6) and linolenic (18: 3n-3) acids, which are defined &#x201C;essential&#x201D; fatty acids since they are not synthesized in the human body and are mostly obtained from diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Russo1">[59]</xref>. They appear to play an important role in the prevention and treatment of a number of diseases (coronary disease, arthritis, inflammatory disorders) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Kuhnt1">[60]</xref>. Pal and Ghosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Pal1">[61]</xref> have shown that activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase in liver and kidney decrease significantly in response to oxidative stress generated by methylmercury (MeHg); but histopathology of liver and kidney cells showed that administration of &#x3B1;-linolenic acid restored, in rat, all the altered parameters and also reduced lipid peroxidation. A recent paper showed a consistently presence of flavonoids and phenolic components in Lisosan G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Packer1">[62]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Lisosan G also contains minerals such as iron, zinc, copper and it is rich in vitamins (B1, B2, B6 and E). Vitamin E is an important natural antioxidant, and its most common and biologically active form is &#x3B1;-tocopherol. Unpublished results have shown that &#x3B1;-lipoic acid (ALA) is among the various components in Lisosan G, and that it is present in a concentration of 66 mg/kg.</p>
      <p>ALA is a thiol antioxidant found in vegetables, including broccoli, spinach and tomatoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Laus1">[63]</xref>. In human leukemia HL-60 cells and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, ALA upregulates NQO1 gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Jia1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Elangovan1">[65]</xref>. In addition, ALA, as sulforaphane, increases phase II protein levels in Clone 9 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Lii1">[66]</xref>. Ogborne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Ogborne1">[67]</xref>, have shown that in human monocytic cells, ALA induces HO-1 expression via Nrf2. It is interesting to note that ALA is an inhibitor of NF-kB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Laus1">[63]</xref> and it inhibits the NF-kB-dependent expression of metalloproteinase-9 <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0083538-Kim1">[68]</xref>. We can suppose that components of Lisosan G, such as linoleic and linolenic acids, &#x3B1;-lipoic acid, flavonoids and phenols, which are known to cross the membrane, could be responsible of activation of NRF2 and of the inhibition of NF-KB in the primary hepatocyte cells.</p>
      <p>This study has established for the first time in primary rat hepatocytes that Lisosan G can modulate phase 2 enzymes through the activation of Nrf2 pathway. We have demonstrated the Lisosan G decreases the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. It seems likely that the beneficial effects of Lisosan G derive from its high phytochemical and vitamin content.</p>
