      <abstract>
        <p>Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a proposed regulator of plant defense signaling in basal resistance and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The <italic>GLY1</italic>-encoded glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and <italic>GLI1</italic>-encoded glycerol kinase (GK) are two key enzymes involved in the G3P biosynthesis in plants. However, their physiological importance in wheat defense against pathogens remains unclear. In this study, quantification analysis revealed that G3P levels were significantly induced in wheat leaves challenged by the avirulent <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>) race CYR23. The transcriptional levels of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> were likewise significantly induced by avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Furthermore, knocking down <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> individually or simultaneously with barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) inhibited G3P accumulation and compromised the resistance in the wheat cultivar Suwon 11, whereas the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and the expression of the SA-induced marker gene <italic>TaPR1</italic> in plant leaves were altered significantly after gene silencing. These results suggested that G3P contributes to wheat systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against stripe rust, and provided evidence that the G3P function as a signaling molecule is conserved in dicots and monocots. Meanwhile, the simultaneous co-silencing of multiple genes by the VIGS system proved to be a powerful tool for multi-gene functional analysis in plants.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plants are continuously exposed to a vast number of potential pathogenic microbes. However, most plants are immune against a mass of microbial invaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Plants rely on the innate immunity of each cell and the signaling pathways activated at infection sites, which both constitute the plant immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There are two strategies that plants utilize to detect pathogenic microbes. On the cell surface of the host plants, conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as fungal chitin or bacterial flagellin. Stimulation of PRRs leads to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Plants have evolved various nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, which are the most common disease resistance (<italic>R</italic>) proteins in response to pathogen effectors by intracellular receptors. NB-LRR proteins recognize effectors and initiate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>The function of both PTI and ETI in plant resistance against pathogens requires intricate signaling networks, which involve various phytohormones that regulate signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Previous evidence suggests that the components of primary metabolism, fatty acids, and their derivatives are important signaling molecules in plant defense; these compound interact with endogenous phytohormones, including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For instance, the proper localization of NPR1, a key component of the SA signaling pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, is dependent on the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The reduction of oleic acid (18:1) can induce expression of the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) resistance gene <italic>HRT</italic>, which responds to SA and confers resistance to TCV in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is an obligatory component and precursor of all plant glycerolipid biosynthesis; it also participates in fatty acid biosynthesis. Previous studies reported that G3P is essential for basal resistance and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Plant G3P is derived via the glycerol kinase (GK)-mediated phosphorylation of glycerol or the NAD-dependent G3P dehydrogenase (G3Pdh)-mediated reduction of dihydroxy-acetone phosphate (DHAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>GLY1</italic>/<italic>SFD1</italic> (encodes G3Pdh) and <italic>GLI1</italic>/<italic>NHO1</italic> (encodes GK) genes contribute to resistance against hemibiotrophic fungi (<italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic>) and bacteria (<italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> DC 3000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>GLI1</italic> is nonspecifically required for nonhost resistance (NHR) to bacterial and fungal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although <italic>GLY1</italic> and <italic>GLI1</italic> are required for resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, their roles in monocots have not been demonstrated. In this study, we isolated and characterized a set of G3Pdh homologous genes and a GK homologous gene from wheat plants challenged with <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> Westend f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> Erikss. (<italic>Pst</italic>). <italic>Pst</italic> is an obligate biotrophic basidiomycete that is one of the top ten plant-pathogenic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Quantification analysis revealed that G3P levels, as well as the expression of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic>, could be induced in wheat leaves challenged by the avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> race CYR23. Furthermore, the barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) system was selected to evaluate the functions of G3P in <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> resistance.</p>

        <title>G3P levels changed are associated with wheat against Pst</title>
        <p>To determine whether G3P is involved in the SAR of wheat against <italic>Pst</italic>, we inoculated the primary leaves with the <italic>Pst</italic> race CYR23 (incompatible interaction) and the distal leaves with CYR31 (compatible interaction) after 48 h. Subsequently, the G3P content in the primary and distal leaves of the wheat cultivar Suwon 11 (Su11) seedlings were compared. The G3P content was strongly increased in both local and distal leaves after 12 hours post-inoculation (hpi), as compared with the water inoculated control. Two respective peaks (more than sixfold) at 48 hpi were observed for the primary and distal leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). After 15 days post-inoculation (dpi) of CYR31, reduced rust sporulation was observed in distal leaves, as compared with the controls that were inoculated on primary leaves with water and then the distal leaves with CYR31 48 h later. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The results indicated that G3P is a potential signaling molecule involved in the SAR of wheat against <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

        <title>Response to Pst infection after knocking down TaGLY1 and TaGLI1 in wheat</title>
        <p>Based on the changes in <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> expression during <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation, the BSMV-VIGS system was employed to knock down the transcription of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and to further investigate their functions in response to <italic>Pst</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The feasibility and silencing efficiency of the BSMV-VIGS system in Su11 was tested using the wheat phytoene desaturase (TaPDS) as a positive control. At 12 dpi with BSMV:TaPDS, photo-bleaching symptoms were observed on wheat seedlings when <italic>TaPDS</italic> was silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the BSMV-VIGS system could be used for assessing the potential roles of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> in wheat resistance against <italic>Pst</italic> infection. Under the same conditions, at 12 dpi with the BSMV:TaGLY1 and BSMV:TaGLI1 recombinant vectors, the mild mosaic and chlorotic phenotypes were apparent in fourth and fifth leaves of Su11 seedlings. Similar results were observed with the control seedlings inoculated with BSMV:&#x3B3;. To study the relationship between <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> in <italic>Pst</italic> resistance, two recombinant vectors were mixed together and rub-inoculated onto Su11 seedlings.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g005">Figure 5</xref>, a conspicuous hypersensitive response (HR) was elicited by <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation in control leaves and leaves with gene silencing. Various numbers of <italic>Pst</italic> uredia were produced around the necrotic spots on the fourth and fifth leaves infected with BSMV:TaGLY1 and BSMV:TaGLI1, as compared with the control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Quantification of the percentages of leaf segment areas covered with <italic>Pst</italic> uredia gave similar results, wherein the uredia covered 6.65%, 4.50% and 12.60% of the surface area in leaves with knocked-down segments of <italic>TaGLY1</italic>-, <italic>TaGLI1</italic>- and <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081756-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081756.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These observations suggested that <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> may have synergistic effects on their respective functions. By contrast, no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) were observed in the percentages of the fifth leaf segment areas covered with <italic>Pst</italic> uredia between the leaves with knocked-down <italic>TaGLY1</italic>-, <italic>TaGLI1</italic>- and <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081756-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081756.s004">Figure S4</xref>), Therefore, the knockdown of <italic>TaGLY1</italic>, <italic>TaGLI1</italic> or <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic> significantly weakened wheat SAR against <italic>Pst</italic> infection.</p>

        <title>Compromised resistance to Pst is associated with SA defection</title>
        <p>Given that <italic>GLY1</italic> and <italic>GLI1</italic> mediated G3P synthesis is essential in SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the involvement of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> in <italic>Pst</italic> resistance was speculated to be associated with the SA signaling pathway. To determine if knocking-down <italic>TaGLY1</italic>, <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic> can affect SA balance in wheat, thereby leading to enhanced resistance to the stripe rust fungus, we further compared the SA accumulation in <italic>Pst</italic> inoculated tissues of VIGS plants to the controls. The SA level was slightly increased at 12 hpi and peaked with a twofold increase at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). However, in leaves with knocked-down <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic>, SA was obviously decreased at 12 hpi, which further declined to its lowest level at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. After 72 hpi, the SA content returned to normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). In BSMV:TaGLY1/TaGLI1 plants, SA accumulation showed similar tendencies with the single-silencing plants and displayed a superposition effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). In addition, the SA-induced marker gene <italic>TaPR1</italic> (GenBank accession No. AAK60565) was selected for real-time PCR analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081756-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, the transcriptional accumulation of <italic>TaPR1</italic> was significantly reduced within 48 and 120 hpi in leaves with knocked-down <italic>TaGLY1</italic>, <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic>, as compared with the BSMV:&#x3B3; controls. These results further indicated that <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> were involved in the SA pathway in response to the avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> race, with an apparent synergistic effect.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>G3P has been reported to confer basal resistance to <italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and SAR by facilitating the systemic translocation of DIR1 in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this study, we measured the G3P accumulation in wheat infected by <italic>Pst</italic>. Quantification assays revealed that G3P levels were significantly increased in both avirulent pathogen inoculated leaves and distal leaves. Meanwhile, the increased G3P accumulation was accompanied by induced SAR, thereby indicating that G3P-mediated SAR was present in gramineous plants.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the cloned <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> exhibited positive transcriptional responses in the incompatible interaction, thereby providing reliable evidence that these genes participated in G3P synthesis and the defense response during wheat&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> interaction. Although the cloned <italic>TaGPDH1-3</italic> encodes a G3P dehydrogenase, only <italic>TaGPDH2</italic> and <italic>TaGPDH3</italic> had less upregulation of the incompatible interaction than that of <italic>TaGLY1</italic>. Therefore, <italic>TaGPDH1</italic> is only involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. These results were consistent with the report of Chanda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which revealed that two <italic>G3Pdh</italic> isoforms contributed to SAR in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In addition, <italic>GLI1</italic> is required for NHR; higher levels of its transcripts were induced from 12 hpi to 24 hpi by non-host pathogen challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Their studies suggested that the functional roles of <italic>GLY1</italic> and <italic>GLI1</italic> in SAR were due to their combined ability to reduce the G3P level. Although we identified four <italic>TaG3Pdhs</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic>, wheat is a hexaploid plant that may possess more isoform genes.</p>
      <p><italic>GLY1</italic> and <italic>GLI1</italic> engage in two parallel pathways for G3P metabolism. Thus, the VIGS system was employed to individually or simultaneously analyze the role of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> in G3P synthesis. In the current study, the necrotic areas triggered by infection of the avirulent pathogen were significantly different at 48 hpi in plants with knocked-down <italic>TaGLY1</italic>, <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic>, as compared with the control plants. According to previous microscopy studies on the incompatible interaction between Su11 wheat and <italic>Pst</italic>, HR is induced by the invasion of the avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> at 24 hpi, which becomes instantly extensive in the late stages of <italic>Pst</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These observations led us to propose that <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> are partly or indirectly associated with cell death. Furthermore, the areas of infection sites in leaves with gene silencing were significantly extended in the late stages of <italic>Pst</italic> invasion. Consistently, few <italic>Pst</italic> uredia were observed on wheat leaves infected with CYR23 at 14 dpi when <italic>TaGLY1</italic>, <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and <italic>TaGLY1</italic>/<italic>TaGLI1</italic> expression were knocked-down, thereby suggesting that the suppression of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> transcripts could promote infection during hyphal growth and sporulation in plants. In addition, <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> were speculated to contribute to the inhibition of hyphal expansion and regulation of cell death by controlling the host G3P metabolism. As the substrate for GLI1, glycerol can be converted to DHAP for GLY1 catalyzed reaction <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present study, the results of histological observations and <italic>Pst</italic> uredia/leaf areas ratios also demonstrated that more obvious susceptible response in plants with knocked-down <italic>TaGLY1</italic> was observed than that in plants with knocked-down <italic>TaGLI1</italic>, indicating that GLY1 can partially revive the missing function of GLI1. Previously, Nandi et al. (2004) reported that <italic>GLY1</italic> is essential for SAR, but not for <italic>P. syringae</italic> basal resistance. However, Chanda et al. (2008) reported that a <italic>gly1</italic> mutant exhibited a compromised basal resistance to <italic>C. higginsianum</italic>. Similarly, we observed that VIGS of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> compromised resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the large difference in the mechanisms of pathogenicity by the various pathogens.</p>
      <p>Although previous studies imply that HR cell death is associated with SA-mediated defense signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], this association remains unclear in wheat&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> interaction. Local infection by a pathogen can further result in the immunization of the remaining foliage against subsequent infections, this phenomenon was phrased as SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. SAR requires the crucial signaling molecule SA, which is typically associated with the systemic expression of pathogenesis-related protein-coding genes and other putative defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The VIGS results of the current study further supported that the reduction of <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and <italic>TaGLY1</italic> transcript levels contributed to the suppression of SA accumulation and <italic>TaPR1</italic> expression in response to the avirulent pathogen infection. The plants with co-silencing showed the superposition of these suppression abilities. The SA signaling pathway for activating disease resistance has been previously studied; SA accumulation is typically induced by <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated signaling (such as NDR1, EDS1, PAD4 and SAG101) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>AtGLI1</italic> is essential in the gene-for-gene resistance of NHR against <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>TaGLI1</italic> and <italic>TaGLY1</italic> may be involved in regulating the SA signaling pathway. These results are consistent with the report of Nandi et al. (2004), which revealed that the <italic>gly1</italic> mutation decreased the SAR-associated accumulation of elevated SA levels and the <italic>PR1</italic> gene transcript in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves. Their study implied that GLY1 is required for the transmission of mobile signal for SAR activation. By contrast, <italic>gly1</italic> and <italic>gli1</italic> plants did not have defective SA responsiveness after <italic>P. syringae</italic> inoculation, although the pathogen-induced G3P accumulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> preceded the increased SA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The most likely explanation is that G3P is associated with the transmission of SA, but it does not affect SA biosynthesis in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>To further analyze the functions of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic>, the BSMV-VIGS system was improved to verify the reliability of our results. We used two recombinant vectors from <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic>, respectively, for co-silencing their target genes by VIGS. Meanwhile, percentage quantification of the uredia covering and histological statistical analyses showed subtle changes generated by the knockdown of target genes. In addition, qRT-PCR was applied to measure the efficiency of these changes. Therefore, the simultaneous co-silencing of <italic>TaGLY1</italic> and <italic>TaGLI1</italic> was found to be a feasible method to study their functions.</p>
      <p>RNA interference (RNAi) has been a remarkable tool for knocking down the activity of specific genes, and gene silencing often depends on the transgenic technology to be integrated at different chromosomal locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Given that wheat has a relatively large genome, a high number of DNA repeat sequences, and a low regeneration ability, it is considered a recalcitrant plant for genetic transformation, as compared with other crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the unstable transformation system of wheat could be replaced by the VIGS technique, which has been used to perform both forward and reverse genetics to identify plant genes involved in several plant processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Previous reports showed that several genes can be simultaneously silenced by combinatorial RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], thereby suggesting that co-silencing is a useful silencing strategy to characterize gene functions. Therefore, the co-silencing of two or more genes using the VIGS system proved to be a powerful reverse genetics tool for large-scale and high-throughput functional analyses of plant genes, particularly in plants which are difficult to genetically transform.</p>
