      <abstract>
        <p>Abiotic stresses are major environmental factors that affect agricultural productivity worldwide. NAC transcription factors play pivotal roles in abiotic stress signaling in plants. As a staple crop, wheat production is severely constrained by abiotic stresses whereas only a few NAC transcription factors have been characterized functionally. To promote the application of NAC genes in wheat improvement by biotechnology, a novel NAC gene designated <italic>TaNAC67</italic> was characterized in common wheat. To determine its role, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing <italic>TaNAC67-GFP</italic> controlled by the CaMV-35S promoter was generated and subjected to various abiotic stresses for morphological and physiological assays. Gene expression showed that <italic>TaNAC67</italic> was involved in response to drought, salt, cold and ABA treatments. Localization assays revealed that TaNAC67 localized in the nucleus. Morphological analysis indicated the transgenics had enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses, simultaneously supported by enhanced expression of multiple abiotic stress responsive genes and improved physiological traits, including strengthened cell membrane stability, retention of higher chlorophyll contents and Na<sup>+</sup> efflux rates, improved photosynthetic potential, and enhanced water retention capability. Overexpression of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> resulted in pronounced enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses, therefore it has potential for utilization in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crops.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Crop plants constantly encounter unfavorable environmental conditions, including drought, high salinity, and extreme temperatures, that significantly affect both biomass and grain yield worldwide. It is well established that transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in response to different abiotic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Qu1">[1]</xref>. TFs have been grouped into diverse families based on the conserved structural domains involved in DNA binding to <italic>cis</italic>-elements in promoters of target genes, or other functional modular structures. Recent accumulated evidence demonstrates that numerous TFs, such as DREB, bZIP, zinc-finger, MYB, WRKY and NAC, directly or indirectly regulate plant defense and stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Seki1">[2]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Zhu1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) superfamily is one of the largest plant-specific TF families. Proteins in this family are characterized by a highly conserved DNA binding NAC domain in the N-terminal and a highly diversified transcriptional activation domain in the C-terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Ooka1">[10]</xref>. More than one hundred NAC members have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, soybean and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Qu1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Fang1">[11]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Hu1">[13]</xref>. Considerable evidence showing that NACs play important roles in plant development, including pattern formation of embryos and flowers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Souer1">[14]</xref>, secondary wall formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Zhong1">[15]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mitsuda1">[17]</xref>, leaf senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Wu1">[18]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Uauy1">[20]</xref>, and root development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Hao1">[21]</xref>. NACs are also involved in responses to various of biotic and abiotic stresses, including disease, drought, salt, cold and low-oxygen stresses, and act as targets of miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Ozhuner1">[22]</xref>. It is believed that NAC TFs have potential to improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerances in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Nakashima1">[23]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Puranik1">[25]</xref>, and some examples are listed below.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, three NAC members, AtNAC019, AtNAC055 and AtNAC072 bind to the ERD1 promoter region and enhance tolerance to drought stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Tran2">[26]</xref>. <italic>AtNAC2</italic> is involved in response to various plant hormones and participates in salt stress response and lateral root development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-He1">[27]</xref>. ATAF1 and ATAF2, along with a counterpart HvNAC6 in barley, play important roles in response to drought and pathogen stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Jensen1">[28]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Lu1">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, AtNAC102 is involved in regulating seed germination under low-oxygen conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Christianson1">[31]</xref>. In rice, several NAC TFs have been well characterized. Overexpression of <italic>SNAC1/OsNAC1</italic>, <italic>OsNAC5</italic>, <italic>SNAC2/OsNAC6</italic>, <italic>OsNAC045</italic>, <italic>OsNAC052</italic> and <italic>OsNAC063</italic> enhance tolerance to drought or multiple abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Hu2">[32]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Gao1">[38]</xref>. In soybean, <italic>GmNAC11</italic> and <italic>GmNAC20</italic> respond differentially to abiotic stresses and phytohormones. Overexpression of <italic>GmNAC20</italic> enhances salt and freezing tolerances, however, <italic>GmNAC11</italic> overexpression only improves salt tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Hao1">[21]</xref>. In cotton, six NAC members were cloned and their differential expression patterns induced by abiotic stresses and ABA were characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Meng1">[39]</xref>. In wheat, multiple NAC genes have been isolated, and different NACs show diverse expression patterns or play various roles in response to environmental stimuli. TaGRAB1 and TaGRAB2 are involved in interaction with the Rep A protein of a geminivirus and thus inhibit DNA replication of wheat dwarf geminivirus in wheat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Xie1">[40]</xref>. <italic>TaNAC69-1</italic>, <italic>TtNAMB-2</italic>, <italic>TaNAC4</italic> and <italic>TaNAC8</italic> participate in response to multi-abiotic or/and biotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Xia1">[41]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Baloglu1">[43]</xref>.

      <p>Production of the world wheat crop is severely constrained by abiotic stresses, especially by drought. Only a few wheat NAC TFs have been well characterized functionally. To promote the application of NAC genes in wheat improvement by biotechnology, we characterized the expression patterns of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> in different tissues, and identified its dynamic responses to water deficit, high salinity, low temperature and ABA treatments. Transgenic experiments showed that overexpression of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> significantly enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses. Morphological assays revealed that overexpression of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> had no negative effects on the growth of transgenic plants, thus it has potential to improve abiotic tolerance in plants.</p>

        <p>Wheat (<italic>Trticum aestivum</italic> L.) genotype &#x201C;Hanxuan 10&#x201D; with a significant degree of drought tolerance was used in this study. Growth conditions were as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao3">[47]</xref>. Two-leaf seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000, &#x2212;0.5 MPa) solution, 250 mM NaCl, low temperature (4&#xB0;C), and 50 &#xB5;M ABA. The treated plants were stressed in the PEG-6000 and NaCl solutions, sprayed with ABA, or cultured in low temperature conditions for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h.</p>
        <p>To investigate the genomic origin of the target gene, 20 accessions of various wheat species, including four A genome (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>urartu</italic>) accessions, four S genome (<italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic>) accessions, four D genome (<italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic>) accessions, four accessions with the AB genome (three <italic>T. dicoccoides</italic> and one <italic>T. dicoccum</italic>), and four hexaploid wheat accessions were selected to perform PCR (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084359.s001">File S1</xref>).

        <title>Isolation of the full-length cDNA and sequence analysis of <italic>TaNAC67</italic></title>
        <p>A 450 bp cDNA fragment, encoding a NAC-like N-terminal domain obtained by sequencing from wheat suppression subtractive cDNA libraries treated with PEG-6000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Pang1">[48]</xref>, was used as a query probe to screen a wheat full-length cDNA library constructed with different tissues by the optimized Cap-trapper method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao4">[49]</xref>. Four candidate clones were obtained by nucleotide blast (blastn), and the full-length cDNA of the target gene was identified by sequencing the ends.

        <title>Sequence characterization of TaNAC67</title>
        <p>The full-length cDNA of the target gene obtained by screening full-length wheat cDNA libraries was 1098 bp, including a 92 bp 5&#x2032; UTR, 894 bp open reading frame, and 112 bp 3&#x2032; UTR. The target gene was named <italic>TaNAC67</italic> based on the structural domains of the deduced protein and blastp results. The ORF encodes a polypeptide of 297 amino acid residues (AA) with a predicted molecular mass of 33.3 kD and pI of 5.41. The deduced amino acid sequence of TaNAC67 shows high homology with NAC family members of monocots, i.e. wheat, <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, rice, barley and maize, and lower homology with counterparts from dicot species, such as <italic>Glycine max</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. TaNAC67 has identities of 90.2% to TaGRAB1 (CAA09371), 74.9% to BdNAC67 (XP_003557366), 70.7% to OsNAC67 (NP_001059213), 65.3% to ZmNAC67 (ACG31804), 61.2% to OsNAC1 (ABD52007), 60.5% to SbNAC1 (AFO85373), 56.1% to TaNAC2 (AAU08786), 54.1% to ZmNAC1 (ADK25055), and 39.1% to TaNAC69 (AAU08785).</p>
        <p>Scansite analysis indicated that TaNAC67 has two regions. The N-terminal region contains a NAC domain (18&#x2013;168 AA) that is highly conserved across both monocots and dicots, and functions as a DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Among them, <italic>TaNAC67</italic> was sensitive to LT and PEG stresses at an early stage (1 h after exposure to abiotic stress), and sensitivity to ABA and NaCl occurred later. Both the expression patterns and maximum expression levels were fundamentally different for each type of stress.

        <p>Prediction of subcellular localization using ProtComp v6.0 software suggested that TaNAC67 was a typical cell nucleus localization protein. To identify the cellular localization of TaNAC67, we examined the expression and distribution of TaNAC67 in both transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root and onion epidermal cells by expression of the fusion protein with GFP by fluorescence microscopy. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> showed, TaNAC67-GFP was expressed in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, especially in young root tips. To further identify the exact cellular localization, we determined the distribution of GFP-tagged TaNAC67 in onion epidermal cells by means of fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

        <p>To assess water retention abilities of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the transgenic lines, along with WT and GFP controls were grown under normal and moderate drought stress conditions. There were no differences in WP between the controls and transgenics under normal growing conditions, whereas the WP of the transgenics were higher than the controls under moderate drought stress (when the rosette leaves became dark); differences for three of the six transgenics were significant, indicating that the transgenic lines retained more water than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To reveal the physiological effects of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> overexpression, the six transgenic lines grown under well-watered conditions were selected for osmotic potential assays.

        <p>Morphological assays indicated that the <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics had enhanced tolerance to drought, salt and cold stresses.

The qRT-PCR results showed that transcripts of four genes (<italic>DREB2A</italic>, <italic>COR15</italic>, <italic>ABI1</italic> and <italic>ABI2</italic>) were significantly and consistently higher in both stressed and non-stressed transgenic plants, and expression levels of five genes (<italic>DERB1A</italic>, <italic>RD29B</italic>, <italic>RD29A</italic>, <italic>Rab18</italic> and <italic>ABI5</italic>) were significantly higher in PEG-stressed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g008">Fig. 8</xref>); whereas the transcript levels of the other four genes (<italic>CBF1</italic>, <italic>CBF2</italic>, <italic>COR47</italic> and <italic>ABA1</italic>) did not differ significantly (data not shown).

        <title>TaNAC67 is a novel member of NAC family</title>
        <p>Sequence analysis showed TaNAC67 has high identity with reported stress responsive NAC members in the N-terminal DNA binding domains, including OsNAC1, TaGRAB1, TaNAC2, TaNAC2a, TaNAC4 and TaNAC69, while differs in the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain. The difference might contribute to functional diversity in plants. Although the DNA binding domains of TaNAC67 and TaNAC2 are quite similar, the characteristics of the two encoding genes differ remarkably. Firstly, their expression levels and response times are different under abiotic stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao1">[3]</xref>. Secondly, overexpression of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> leads to shorter primary roots (Fig. S2A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084359.s001">File S1</xref>), while <italic>TaNAC2</italic> transgenics have longer primary roots relative to WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao1">[3]</xref>, and a negative relationship is evident between primary root length and the expression level of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Fig. S1, S2A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084359.s001">File S1</xref>), thus favorable expression level of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> should be reconsidered following selection of a proper promoter for abiotic stress tolerance enhancement. Thirdly, the abiotic stress responsive genes regulated by the two genes are different. Overexpression of the two genes leads to the upregulation of <italic>DREB2A</italic>, <italic>RD29A</italic>, <italic>RD29B</italic>, <italic>Rab18</italic>, <italic>ABI1, ABI2</italic> and <italic>ABI5</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, while <italic>TaNAC67</italic> also upregulates the expression of <italic>DREB1A</italic> and <italic>COR15</italic>. Moreover, the expression pattern of dehydration responsive gene <italic>RD2</italic>2 is different in the two transgenics. <italic>RD22</italic> was upregulated under normal growth conditions in <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics, and downregulated after exposure to drought stress. However, <italic>RD22</italic> was consistently upregulated in <italic>TaNAC2</italic> plants under both normal and stressed conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the molecular mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerances enhancement for the two NACs might be different in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
        <p>No differences in lateral root numbers were identified between transgenic plants and the controls, and no growth retardation was apparent in <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transformants (Fig. S2B, S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084359.s001">File S1</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaNAC67</italic> has potential to improve tolerances to abiotic stresses in crops.</p>

        <title>Physiological changes in transgenic <italic>TaNAC67</italic> plants under various conditions</title>
        <p>Environmental stresses often cause physiological changes in plants. Physiological indices such as CMS, OP, WP, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> flux rates are useful parameters for evaluating abiotic stress resistance in crop plants.</p>
        <p>Chloroplasts are among the most sensitive organs responding to salt stress. Chlorophyll degeneration in crops often occurs rapidly after exposure to high salinity, and thus chlorophyll content could be an indicator of damage to the photosynthetic system by salt stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence of intact leaves, especially the fluorescence induction pattern, is a reliable, non-invasive method for monitoring photosynthetic events and reflects the physiological status of plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Strasser1">[59]</xref>. The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence is an important parameter used to assess the physiological status of PSII. Environmental stresses that affect PS II efficiency are known to cause decreases in <italic>Fv/m</italic> ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Krause1">[60]</xref>. In the present research, we measured the two indices, and most transgenic lines were superior to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g005">Fig. 5A, D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics had more robust photosynthetic capabilities than the controls under severe salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g007">Fig. 7B, D</xref>).</p>
        <p>WP is a direct reflection of water retention ability for plants under water deficit conditions, and a higher WP means that more water is retained in plants. The WP of most <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics were significantly higher than the WT and GFP controls under moderate drought stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), suggesting that the transgenics have stronger water retention capacity. Osmotic potential is another direct indicator of water content in plants. Generally, a higher OP suggests more water retained in plant cell under normal or slight water stress conditions. The higher OPs of transgenics suggest that <italic>TaNAC67</italic> plants hold more water in plants, which is consistent with the WP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Under our growing conditions, both the depth of container and soil moisture are fixed, thus the higher WP in transgenics had no relationship with root system but enhanced water retention ability, despite that the primary root length for most transgenic lines was significantly shorter than WT (Fig. S2B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084359.s001">File S1</xref>), therefore, we speculate the transgenics might have lower stomatal conductance under slight drought stress. In this regard, TaNAC67 might have a similar function with the well-characterized SNAC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Hu3">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Cell membranes are among the first targets of many stresses. The maintenance of membrane integrity and stability under water stress conditions is a major component of environmental stress tolerance in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Levitt1">[61]</xref>, and CMS has been used for assessing tolerance to frost, heat and desiccation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Farooq1">[62]</xref>. In this study, the CMS of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> plants under salinity and drought stresses were higher than the WT and GFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>), demonstrating that CMS enhancement is caused by overexpression of <italic>TaNAC67</italic>, indicating that <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics might have a strong capacity to tolerate adverse environmental stresses, as verified by the phenotyping assays in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
        <p>The ion flux measuring technique provides a unique possibility to link genetic/genomic data and cellular physiological behavior because of its non-invasive, high spatial and temporal resolution features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Shabala1">[63]</xref>. NaCl-induced K<sup>+</sup> efflux was demonstrated as a physiological &#x2018;marker&#x2019; for salt tolerance in several species, including maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Wakeel1">[64]</xref>, barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Chen2">[65]</xref>, wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Cuin1">[66]</xref> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Shabala1">[63]</xref>. The ability to retain K<sup>+</sup> most effectively (i.e. to minimize K<sup>+</sup> efflux when Na<sup>+</sup> was applied) proved to be a trait strongly correlated with ability to thrive at high salt concentrations in barley, and K<sup>+</sup> flux measurements were recommended as a screen for selecting salt tolerance in crop species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Chen3">[67]</xref>. In this study, we measured K<sup>+</sup> efflux under salt-shock conditions, and found that the K<sup>+</sup> efflux rates of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics were significantly higher than WT <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), suggesting that the transgenics did not have a stronger capacity to retain K<sup>+</sup> compared to WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Shabala1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Cuin1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Chen4">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Cuin2">[69]</xref>. This seemed to be in conflict with the evident salt tolerant phenotypes for the transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g007">Fig. 7B, D</xref>). To further decipher the mechanism of enhanced salt tolerance in transgenics, Na<sup>+</sup> ion efflux rates were measured under conditions of salt pre-treatment, and the Na<sup>+</sup> efflux rates in the transgenics were significantly higher than the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084359-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaNAC67</italic> plants had stronger capacity to extrude Na<sup>+</sup> ions. Based on the phenotypes and results of ion flux measurements, we attribute the enhanced tolerance to high salinity mainly to robust Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion in the transgenics. Therefore, for <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, K<sup>+</sup> retention ability seems to have a lower correlation with salt tolerance, and homeostasis between K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> might be a more appropriate parameter to assess the phenotype under salt stress.</p>

Recent studies showed that <italic>TaNAC69-1</italic>, <italic>TtNAMB-2</italic>, <italic>TaNAC4</italic> and <italic>TaNAC8</italic> were involved multiple abiotic or/and biotic stress responses in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Xia1">[41]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Baloglu1">[43]</xref>, and overexpression of <italic>TaNAC2</italic>, <italic>TaNAC2a</italic> and <italic>TaNAC69</italic> led to a pronounced enhancement of tolerance to multi-abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Mao1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Xue2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Tang1">[46]</xref>. Here, we observed the dynamic expressions of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> under various abiotic stresses and found that overexpression of <italic>TaNAC67</italic> led to enhanced tolerance to drought, salinity and freezing stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In the present study, <italic>TaNAC67</italic> transgenics were exposed to severe drought, salt and freezing stresses. Both morphological and physiological evidence strongly demonstrated that transgenic lines had more pronounced tolerances to drought, salinity and freezing stresses than WT.</p>
        <p>Based on the present data, we attribute the enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress conferred by <italic>TaNAC67</italic> to significantly and consistently increased expression of abiotic stress responsive genes, including <italic>DREB2A</italic>, <italic>COR15</italic>, <italic>ABI1</italic> and <italic>ABI2</italic>. <italic>DREB2A</italic> is a crucial regulatory element involved in drought response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Liu1">[71]</xref>. Its significant upregulation undoubtedly increased the expression levels of downstream drought stress responsive genes, and thus enhanced tolerance to drought and or other abiotic stresses, because of the widespread cross talk between different environmental stress response pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Seki1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Xiong1">[72]</xref>. The <italic>ABI1</italic> and <italic>ABI2</italic> genes encode homologous type-2C protein phosphatases, involved in ABA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Finkelstein1">[73]</xref>, and their high expression level might lead to upregulation of genes controlled by <italic>ABI1</italic> and <italic>ABI2</italic> in the ABA dependent pathway, and might enhance an integrated tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. <italic>DREB1A/CBF3</italic> encodes a crucial TF, whose overexpression leads to enhanced tolerance to drought, salinity and cold stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Medina1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Dubouzet1">[75]</xref>. <italic>RD29A</italic>, <italic>RD29B</italic> and <italic>Rab18</italic> are low molecular weight hydrophilic protein encoding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084359-Lang1">[77]</xref>; significant augmentation of hydrophilic proteins in tissue sap should be helpful for water retention under stressed conditions.
