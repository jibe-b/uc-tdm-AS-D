        <p>Identification of traits and regions in the wheat genome that are involved in night-time and daytime transpiration response to evaporative demand, which can enhance yield-based drought tolerance in wheat.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a key component of drought and has a strong influence on yields. Whole-plant transpiration rate (TR) response to increasing VPD has been linked to drought tolerance in wheat, but because of its challenging phenotyping, its genetic basis remains unexplored. Further, the genetic control of other key traits linked to daytime TR such as leaf area, stomata densities and &#x2013; more recently &#x2013; nocturnal transpiration remains unknown. Considering the presence of wheat phenology genes that can interfere with drought tolerance, the aim of this investigation was to identify at an enhanced resolution the genetic basis of the above traits while investigating the effects of phenology genes <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> and <italic>Ppd-B1</italic>. Virtually all traits were highly heritable (heritabilities from 0.61 to 0.91) and a total of mostly trait-specific 68 QTL were detected. Six QTL were identified for TR response to VPD, with one QTL (QSLP.ucl-5A) individually explaining 25.4% of the genetic variance. This QTL harbored several genes previously reported to be involved in ABA signaling, interaction with DREB2A and root hydraulics. Surprisingly, nocturnal TR and stomata densities on both leaf sides were characterized by highly specific and robust QTL. In addition, negative correlations were found between TR and leaf area suggesting trade-offs between these traits. Further, <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> had strong but opposite effects on these traits, suggesting an involvement in this trade-off. Overall, these findings revealed novel genetic resources while suggesting a more direct role of phenology genes in enhancing wheat drought tolerance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Drought is the major factor limiting yield production in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Tester and Langridge, 2010</xref>). One often-overlooked variable in quantifying drought impact on yield is air vapor pressure deficit (VPD). This variable, which is also termed &#x2018;atmospheric drought&#x2019;, encapsulates the combined effects of air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH), and is the main driving force of the whole-plant transpiration rate (TR) (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Monteith, 1995</xref>). In natural environments, both T and RH contribute to the variation in VPD: on a sunny day, VPD typically increases as T increases and RH decreases progressively throughout the day. In dry environments, this increase takes place during the most part of the day, with VPD values increasing 3&#x2013;4-fold over a few hours. Because TR and CO<sub>2</sub> intake both occur through the same leaf anatomical structure, namely the stomata, TR responses to increasing VPD have been linked both theoretically and experimentally to yield under terminal water deficit regimes (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Vadez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Lobell <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> reported that atmospheric VPD has a much stronger effect on current and future yields than previously thought. This effect poses a major challenge for a crop such as wheat whose worldwide yield stagnation has been associated with an increase in the frequency of heat and drought events (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Brisson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), both resulting in high-VPD conditions.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The extent of available genetic variability in TR responses to VPD has been investigated in several crops, such as soybean (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Sadok and Sinclair, 2009</xref>), maize (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Gholipoor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), pearl millet (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kholov&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and wheat (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok, 2012</xref>). Despite this progress however, phenotyping and identifying the genetic basis of whole-plant TR response curves to increasing VPD remains undocumented. On pearl millet, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Kholov&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> developed a phenotyping approach that allowed for identifying the genetic basis of TR at two different VPD levels, in the morning and the afternoon, but response curves linking TR to increasing VPD were not established. On wheat, several efforts have been undertaken to phenotype wheat transpiration-related traits across populations and environments, but these focused on measuring single leaf conductance (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Condon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Rebetzke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003, 2013</xref>). While revealing a substantial and heritable genetic variability, those efforts were often challenged by leaf-to-leaf variations in stomata conductance and its interaction with VPD fluctuations (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Rebetzke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This further justifies the relevance of attempting an integrative, whole-plant approach to measuring canopy conductance (i.e. the slope of TR response to VPD), while taking into account the strong effect of VPD variations throughout the day. Such effort inevitably requires phenotyping response curves as inputs to a QTL analysis. Because it requires highly accurate whole-plant transpiration and leaf area measurements simultaneously for hundreds of plants under naturally fluctuating conditions, attempting such approach has often been seen as a major phenotyping bottleneck, prompting the need for a new type of high throughput lysimetric phenotyping platforms (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Vadez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Three groups of other key traits influence whole-plant water use, likely in strong interaction with TR response to VPD. The first is leaf area and related biomass. Like TR, leaf area expansion is strongly influenced by VPD in a genotype-dependent manner (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Sadok <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, recent evidence on wheat (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok, 2013</xref>) and soybean (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Devi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) suggest that TR and leaf area responses to VPD are coupled, such that TR increases under high VPD are &#x2018;compensated&#x2019; by decreases in leaf areas. This indicates that a trade-off exists between both traits that needs to be considered when breeding for either of these traits, making it necessary to investigate their phenotypic and genetic links. Specific leaf area (SLA, the area-to-mass ratio) is a trait that is strongly dependent on leaf area and is often seen as a proxy trait for early vigor (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Rebetzke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and radiation interception and photosynthetic assimilation (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Boote <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In wheat, SLA has been shown to have a genetic basis, but it was seldom estimated on a whole plant basis (WPSLA). As a result, the extent of links between SLA, whole-plant leaf area and TR response to VPD remains undocumented. These are important to consider if breeding programs are targeting increasing SLA in drought-prone areas (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Rebetzke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Another group of traits that are potentially connected to TR response to VPD consists of adaxial and/or abaxial stomata densities (SDAD and SDAB, respectively). Reduction in stomata density has been recently linked to drought tolerance achieved through a decrease in transpiration (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Doheny-Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). So far however no direct links between stomata densities and agronomic yield have been reported in the literature. One possible explanation for that is the lack of evidence of a genetic basis underlying these traits and the absence of a link between stomata densities and whole-plant water use traits such as TR and leaf areas in crop plants. Therefore, phenotyping stomata densities in conjunction with the above traits is likely to provide new answers regarding their genetic control and functional relevance with respect to drought tolerance.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The third is night-time TR (TRN), which until recently was seen to be either marginal or nonexistent, with no clear genetic basis or agronomic relevance with respect to drought tolerance in crops, despite literature pointing to such possibility (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Rawson and Clarke, 1988</xref>). In wheat, the recent report of <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach <italic>et al.</italic> (2014a)</xref> indicates that night-time TR can be non-null while being largely controlled by the level of night-time VPD. Further, the study revealed that night-time TR mirrored those observed under daytime conditions, and in particular, the water-saving behavior of a drought tolerant breeding line (RAC875). In the literature, the physiological and/or genetic basis for nocturnal transpiration in plants remains largely unknown with only the investigation of <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Christman <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> reporting one QTL for nocturnal stomata conductance in Arabidopsis. Investigating the genetic basis of TRN is likely to provide new clues as to its physiological basis and relevance as a drought tolerance trait.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Potentially influencing all of the above, an important feature of wheat physiology is its dependence on major genes that strongly influence phenology by controlling photoperiod sensitivity (<italic>Ppd</italic> genes). In some wheat populations, the effect of these genes is such that their effects are explicitly included as covariates in crop models aiming at predicting key periods for determining yield such as heading time (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, there is evidence that even among populations flowering within small time windows, the effects of genes such as <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> and <italic>Ppd-B1</italic> on yield related-traits under drought are large (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), suggesting direct effects of those genes on drought tolerance traits. Examining the effects of such maturity genes on each of the considered traits will shed new lights on the ways development and functional traits interact to achieve drought tolerance.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The objective of this study was to examine the genetic basis of the above traits and their dependence on phenology genes within a wheat mapping population consisting of 143 double haploid (DH) lines descending from a cross between a conservative, drought-tolerant donor parent (RAC875) and a check cultivar (Kukri) at a genetic resolution that readily offers access to genomic and molecular information. To this end, we developed a methodological framework combining (i) a new, high throughput phenotyping method (ii) a high-density genetic map (iii) a whole-genome QTL analysis and (iv) a genomic approach for identifying putative drought-tolerance genes.</p>

        <p>The genetic material used in the study consisted of a set of bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) 143 DH lines descending from the F1 generation of a cross between the drought tolerant donor line RAC875 (RAC655/3/ Sr21/4*Lance//4*Bayonet) and the check cultivar Kukri (76ECN44/76ECN36//Madden/6*RAC177). RAC875 has been reported to display a conservative TR in response to soil water deficit in comparison to Kukri (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok, 2012</xref>). Both genotypes were developed by the Roseworthy Agricultural Campus and the University of Adelaide. The 143 DH lines were randomly selected among a group of lines that flowered within a narrow window of ~3d.</p>

        <title>Sowing and growth conditions</title>
        <p>The plants were sown on 7 May 2014 and grown for 36 d in a new automated glasshouse at the Universit&#xE9; catholique de Louvain, Belgium (50&#xB0;40&#x2B9;N, 4&#xB0;36&#x2B9;E). During the growth period, the glasshouse was programmed for a daytime T setting of 20 &#xB0;C (min.) and 35 &#xB0;C (max.), resulting in average daytime/night-time T and VPD values of 28.6 &#xB0;C (&#xB1;0.5 SE) and 2.25 kPa (&#xB1;0.10 SE)/22.8 &#xB0;C (&#xB1;0.3 SE) and 1.3 kPa (&#xB1;0.03 SE) respectively. The glasshouse system provided a supplementary lighting that was activated automatically each time incident daytime photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) levels dropped below 500 &#x3BC;mol m <sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> by means of a high intensity photosynthetic LED lighting system (~200 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at canopy level, Pro 650, LumiGrow, Novato, California, USA).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Three replicate plants per genotype including both parents were sown at a depth of 2.5cm in 435 custom-made PVC columns (0.11 m diameter and 0.33 m tall), each filled with 1.40&#x2013;1.45kg of compost garden soil (DCM Corporation, Grobbendonk, Belgium). The pots were covered with aluminum foil to avoid excessive soil heating and six small holes were drilled in the bottom of the pots to allow for drainage. Prior to sowing, all the seeds were weighted and only those with weights in the 0.030&#x2013;0.035g range were selected. Seven days after sowing, each pot was thinned to a single plant. Pots were watered every 2&#x2013;3 d during the first 2 weeks and then daily until the experiment was initiated, 36 d after sowing. During the growth period, in addition to the glasshouse sensors, T and RH conditions were continuously recorded in the immediate vicinity of the plants every 5min by shielded pocket sensors connected to USB dataloggers (EL-USB-2-LCD, Lascar Electronics, Whiteparish, UK) placed in five locations across the setup.</p>

        <title>Phenotyping transpirational water loss</title>
        <p>Daytime TR responses to VPD were carried out as in <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok (2012)</xref>, that is, under naturally fluctuating greenhouse conditions, where VPD increased progressively throughout a large portion of the day. On the day before the TR measurements began, the pots were watered to dripping around 17:00 solar time and aluminum foils were immediately placed over the soil and sealed around the stem of the plant to eliminate direct soil evaporation. The pots were then allowed to drain overnight. The following morning, the measurements were initiated on the fully well-watered plants by weighting the pots every hour from 06:00 to 13:00 solar time. During this time period, the incident PPFD exceeded the saturating value of 503 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> starting from the second TR measurement until the end of the experiment.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Five persons performed the weightings simultaneously by placing the pots on five identical balances with a resolution of 0.01g (Model Fx-3000i, A &amp; D Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) connected to five dataloggers, thereby making it possible to perform hourly weightings within 25&#x2013;30min. During this time period, the average hourly air VPD inside the glasshouse continuously increased from 1.1 to 3.7 kPa over a period of 7h (instantaneous RH decreasing from 60.2 to 33.3% and T increasing from 20.9 to 38.5 &#xB0;C). During the weightings, T and RH measurements were recorded every 5min in nine locations across the setup by the same pocket sensors as those mentioned previously. For each genotype, the transpirational water loss at a given VPD was calculated as the difference in pot weight (normalized by leaf area) over a period of 60min while averaging the VPD values during the same period. Repeating the procedure over the course of the 7h ensured that regressions characterizing the slopes (SLP) of whole-plant TR response curves to increasing VPD could be constructed (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Sadok and Sinclair, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok, 2012</xref>). At the end of the weighting sequence, the plants were re-watered to dipping. All plants were weighted later that day at ~23:00 and the following morning at around 04:00, over a period during which night-time VPD was constant at 1.3 kPa and PPFD at 0 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Night-time TR (TRN) was estimated for each genotype as the difference in pot weight over the 5h period, normalized by plant size (i.e. leaf area). The daytime phenotyping approach was replicated during an independent experiment carried out on 26 April 2015 on eight select genotypes displaying SLP values that covered the entire phenotypic range of the population. The plants were grown for 37 d in the same environment as described above and whole-plant TR was determined in the same way, except that it was measured at a constant VPD of 2.5 kPa in a walk-in growth chamber, where PPFD was kept constant at ~450 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. These TR values were examined in relation to those measured during the 2014 phenotyping experiment at the same VPD of 2.5 kPa, and under higher PPFD (850 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). This allowed for testing the repeatability of the TR measurements over different durations and light environments.</p>

        <title>Phenotyping whole-plant leaf area and biomass</title>
        <p>After measuring transpirational water loss, whole-plant leaf areas (WPLAs) were measured using a high-precision leaf area meter (LI- 3100C, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) connected to a laptop. As indicated above, the resulting values were used for normalizing TR to account for differences in plant size and also recorded as independent phenotypic variables. Afterwards, whole-plant leaf dry weights, tiller and spike dry weights (TSW), Zadoks growth scale (ZS) score and number of tillers (NTIL) were recorded. The dry weights were measured using a precision balance with a resolution of 0.001g after placing the samples inside a drying oven at 60 &#xB0;C for 7&#x2013;8 d. Whole-plant leaf dry weights and WPLA were used to calculate the whole-plant specific leaf area (WPSLA), the ratio of leaf area to its dry weight (cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p>

        <title>Phenotyping stomata densities</title>
        <p>Given the high number of plants, a simple and new method for rapidly measuring stomata densities was devised. During leaf area measurements, 3 cm-long leaf segments were cut in the mature region of the top, most fully developed leaf of each plant. The segments were then fixed in a FAA solution (ethanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid) for 1 week and then transferred to a bleaching solution (ethanol, acetic acid) for 3 d before they were stored in a 70% ethanol solution. Stomata densities were then determined for the abaxial and adaxial sides using a light microscope (Eclipse E400, Nikon Corporation Instruments Company, Japan) equipped with a digital camera. On each side, the adaxial (SDAD) and abaxial (SDAB) stomata densities were determined on the basis of three major vein-free areas each covering 0.915mm<sup>2</sup> (magnification &#xD7;200).</p>

The linkage map spanned 26 linkage groups with 1333 unique loci, a total length of 2864.3 cM and an average inter-marker distance of 2.18 cM. This represented a dramatic reduction from the 7.32 cM average inter-marker distance in the SSR-DArTs linkage map of <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> and implied significantly higher resolution QTL mapping is achievable with the integrated SSR-DArTs-SNP linkage map.

        <title>Linear mixed model analysis</title>
        <p>After an exploratory analysis of the traits, it was found ZS exhibited significant non-normality and was excluded from further analysis. For the remaining traits, an initial analysis was conducted using a linear mixed model which accounted for genetic sources of variation from the DH lines as well as non-genetic sources of variation arising from the design of the experiment. The fixed component of the linear mixed model contained a factor consisting of a level for all the DH lines and one for each of the parents, RAC875 and Kukri. The inclusion of this term ensured the parents remained fixed in the analysis. Given that this population was known to segregate for phenology loci <italic>Ppd-B1</italic> and <italic>Ppd-D1</italic>, the effect of these genes had to be accounted for as in <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bonneau <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. To ensure the genetic component of the model was appropriately adjusted for phenology loci, maturity genes <italic>Ppd-B1</italic> and <italic>Ppd-D1,</italic> numerically coded as AA=1 and BB=&#x2212;1 with missing values set to zero to reflect the uncertainty of the allele call, were added to the fixed component of the model as covariates (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Extraneous non-genetic variation, such as replicate effects, were captured using random effects. The random component of the model also contained a genetic term consisting of a factor with a level for each of the DH genotypes and parents. As the parents were fixed, the genetic variance for this term was associated with the DH lines only. With the exception of SLP, appropriate information was extracted from each of the fitted trait models and broad sense heritabilities were calculated using the formula derived in <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Cullis <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref>. To provide an indication of the heritable nature of TR across the measured VPD levels, additional linear mixed models were fitted for whole-plant TR at the lowest (1.1 kPa, TR1.1) and highest VPD (3.7 kPa, TR3.7) levels (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Kholov&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

        <title>Multi-trait linear mixed model analysis</title>
        <p>To provide an accurate assessment of the genetic inter-relatedness of the nine traits a multi-trait linear mixed model analysis was conducted. Preceding analysis, each of the traits was standardized by subtracting its mean and dividing through by its standard deviation. The fixed component of the multi-trait model contained trait by <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> and trait by <italic>Ppd-B1</italic> terms to model the phenology genes for each trait. Non-genetic sources of variation such as replicate effects were modeled using a separate variance for each trait. An important aspect of the multi-trait linear mixed model was the addition of terms that accurately model the relatedness of the traits at the residual and genetic level. Consequently, the variance of the residuals was assumed to have an unstructured variance-covariance matrix with residual variances for each of the traits on the diagonal and covariances on the off diagonals to capture the connection between traits at the residual level. Similarly, an unstructured variance-covariance structure was assumed for the variance of the genotype by trait interaction random effect term. The diagonal components of this matrix consisted of genetic variances of the DH lines for each of the traits and the off diagonals were genetic covariances that reflected the relationships of the DH lines between traits. From the fitted multi-trait model the estimated genetic variance-covariance structure was extracted and a genetic correlation was calculated. All univariate and multi-trait linear mixed model analyses were performed using the flexible linear mixed modeling package ASReml-R (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Butler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) available in the R statistical computing environment.</p>

        <title>QTL analysis</title>
        <p>For each trait a QTL analysis was undertaken using the whole genome average interval mapping (WGAIM) approach of <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Verbyla <italic>et al.</italic> (2007, 2012</xref>). This approach uses a whole genome procedure for detection and estimation of QTL through extensions of the established linear mixed model for each trait. Initially, a working linear mixed is derived that incorporates the whole genome pseudo-interval marker set as a contiguous block of random effect covariates with zero mean and a single marker variance parameter. This variance parameter is then tested and if found significant an outlier statistic profile is used to identify and select the most likely interval containing the putative QTL. This interval is then removed from the contiguous block and placed as a separate random effect. This process is repeated until the marker variance parameter is not significant and no more putative QTL are detected. The combination of this forward selection approach and the implementation of the high dimensional methodology outlined in <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Verbyla <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> ensures WGAIM is efficient for small to moderate population sizes with large sets of genetic markers. The WGAIM approach is computationally implemented in the R package wgaim (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Verbyla, 2011</xref>) available in the R statistical computing environment. The package provides detailed summaries of significantly detected QTL including their position, effect size, LOD score and contribution to the genetic variance. Additionally, it contains a function to plot the linkage map with significant QTL intervals highlighted for multiple traits simultaneously.</p>

To obtain gene expression information for genes located in the QTL region we used the PopSeq map for bread wheat together with the high confidence (HC) gene predictions described in <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">IWGSC (2014)</xref> and the publicly available RNA-Seq data for cv. Chinese Spring (<uri xlink:href="http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository/RNA-Seq">http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository/RNA-Seq</uri>). This dataset covers five different organs (root, leaf, stem, spike, grain) at three developmental stages, each in two replicates. We used the HC gene predictions, version 2.1 (ftp://ftpmips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plants/wheat/IWGSC/genePrediction_v2.1/) as reference for mapping the RNA-Seq reads. The reference was prepared by extracting the genomic sequence for each of the predicted genes with up to 2kb upstream and downstream bases whenever available from the corresponding IWGSC-CSS contig. The coordinates in the corresponding GTF/GFF transcript annotations file were adjusted accordingly. RNA-Seq reads were quality-, adapter- and length-trimmed using Trimmomatic (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bolger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), version 0.30, with a custom list of adapter sequences and the following settings: &#x2018;ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:1:6:6 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:6 MINLEN:60&#x2019;. After indexing the reference using Bowtie2 (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) version 2.2.1, trimmed reads were aligned to the reference using TopHat (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) version 2.2.1, not allowing any mismatches or indels. Paired reads were required to map concordantly (--no-discordant setting) to the same (--no-mixed setting) reference sequence. BAM files for the biological replicates were merged, apart from a single tissue/stage sample (spike_Z39) where only one sample was available. Expression was quantified by Cufflinks (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Roberts <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) version 2.1.1 utilizing (through the --GTF option) the adjusted version of the reference transcript annotations provided with the HC gene predictions. The remaining settings were left at their defaults, except for: --max-multiread-fraction 1, --frag-len-std-dev 50 --max-intron-length 5 000. FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) per gene (rather than per isoform) were extracted and aggregated in tabular form. Functional annotation was obtained by comparison of the HC gene predictions to MSU Rice Genome, Release 7, and Arabidopsis TAIR using BlastX (expect-value &lt;10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>).</p>

All of the eight QTL, with the exception of a relatively minor one detected for TR3.7 on chromosome 5B, were specific to daytime TR. One QTL, detected on chromosome 5A was common for both TR1.1 and TR3.7 explaining 19.3% and 21.6% of the genetic variance, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, TR1.1 and TR3.7 were each controlled by distinct major QTL on chromosomes 5B and 2D explaining 11.1% and 20.8% of the genetic variance, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Overall, the RAC875 allele decreased transpiration for six out of the eight QTL detected.</p>

        <p>The peak region of the major locus QSLP.ucl-5A was delineated from 110.99 to 113.75 cM including a total of 53 SNP. After removing SNP corresponding to the same locus (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), we found 29 unique HC gene predictions for the interval. Of those, a first group of 13 genes were found in the PopSeq map delineating the corresponding region from 54.88 to 55.66 cM (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">IWGSC, 2014</xref>), which included a total of 56 wheat genes.

        <p content-type="indent">Rice and Arabidopsis homologs were found for 68 of these 72 genes and within this group, a search in TAIR indicated that at least 32 homologs are potentially drought-related (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw125/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). The search identified a first group of 12 closely drought-tolerance related genes. These were directly involved in water transport, response to abscissic acid, osmotic stress, water stress, heat stress, root development response to ABA and plant hydraulics traits (i.e. xylem development). A second group was identified, consisting of another 13 stress-related, but non-drought specific genes. A final group consisted of seven non-stress response genes, but whose functions are likely to be involved in TR response to VPD, such as cell growth and elongation, leaf development, temperature response and photosynthesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw125/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>).

      <sec id="s21">
        <title>There is a strong genetic basis for whole-plant transpiration response to increasing VPD in wheat</title>
        <p>Since the 1990s, several investigations have shown that transpiration-related traits such as single leaf conductance were heritable and genetically structured in wheat (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Condon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Rebetzke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). However the approach of circumventing leaf-to-leaf variation while taking into account the driving effect of VPD in order to phenotype response curves within an entire population was not attempted. In pearl millet, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Kholov&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> characterized whole-plant TR in a mapping population, but those measurements were made over five different days at two different VPD levels. On soybean, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Sadok and Sinclair (2009)</xref> attempted to construct entire TR vs. VPD response curves for recombinant inbred lines resulting from a cross between a &#x2018;conservative&#x2019;, drought-tolerant line and a check commercial cultivar, but those were limited to only 22 genotypes. Our approach allowed for containing the key limitations (see final section) underlying the precise phenotyping of TR response curves to increasing VPD simultaneously for hundreds of plants.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">When compared to the diversity of the responses previously identified in wheat (i.e. <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok, 2012</xref>), the systematically linear nature of the relationship linking TR to increasing VPD appears striking. The large variation in the slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) indicates a strong variation in canopy conductance in this population. This suggests that under our experimental conditions, leaf and/or root hydraulic conductance were unlikely to have changed as VPD increased. In this regard, assuming additive effects of the different QTL, our experimental approach appears to have captured the 83.4% of the loci controlling whole-plant leaf conductance in this population while revealing major QTL. One of those (QSLP.ucl-5A) individually explained the highest genetic variance among all detected QTL in this analysis. This QTL was detected on chromosome 5A, and importantly, was specific to daytime TR response to VPD. The above, combined with (i) the particularly narrow region defining the peak of this QTL (0.45 to 0.92 cM), (ii) the associated high heritabilities (0.7 and 0.63, respectively, for traits TR1.1 and TR3.7) and (iii) the fact that the RAC875 allele at this locus confers a conservative TR, made this QTL a good target for a further genetic dissection.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Using the high-resolution map of the QTL plot with 53 SNP markers underneath, QSLP.ucl-5A was anchored onto the chromosome-based draft sequence of the wheat genome and for gene discovery (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">IWGSC, 2014</xref>). The dissection of the peak region of QSLP.ucl-5A revealed 12 genes that were drought-related in Arabidopsis, including DRIP1, a negative regulator of DREB2A, a transcription factor involved in drought tolerance whose expression levels were found to be highly increased in the roots of soybean mutants exposed to water deficit (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Engels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Consistently, a large majority (nine) of these genes were preferentially expressed in the well-watered roots of the cultivar Chinese Spring, with annotations suggesting roles in root development and response to ABA, water transport and xylem formation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw125/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). Those findings are strongly in line with our previous report where we traced back the conservative behavior of the drought tolerant line RAC875 to a lowered root hydraulic conductivity that was linked to a limited metaxylem size in the seminal roots, together with a restricted trans-membrane water transport &#x2013; likely involving aquaporins (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014b</xref>). Several other potentially drought related genes were involved in leaf-based gas-exchange related processes (e.g. photosynthesis, temperature response, leaf expansion), consistently with the involvement of leaf hydraulics in TR response to VPD. Further research is necessary to confirm these genes and unravel their physiological roles in order to substantiate their relevance at the whole plant level, particularly in terms of whole-plant water use response to evaporative demand.</p>

        <title>Trade-offs between traits involved in transpiration response to evaporative demand</title>
        <p>There was a strong, negative genetic and phenotypic correlation between SLP and WPLA, confirming previous long term studies on wheat (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok 2013</xref>) and soybean (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Devi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Such correlation is consistent with the recent investigation of <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Pantin <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>, who reported a negative relationship between plant size and transpiration in Arabidopsis. This correlation was mediated by an ontogeny-dependent acquisition of sensitivity to ABA in the leaves, which progressively limits transpiration as the leaves get older and the plant total leaf area gets larger. Interestingly, this acquisition was triggered by the progressive exposure of bigger leaves to higher evaporative demand, suggesting a developmental link between TR response to VPD and ABA, which is consistent with the nature of the genes identified in the peak region of QSLP.ucl-5A and also with the divergent influence of <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> and <italic>Ppd-B1</italic> on SLP and WPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In any case, if the reported correlations are valid beyond this population, they suggest that there are trade-offs to selecting for low TR under high VPD, which might lead to selecting plants with larger leaf areas. However, the fact that only 1 QTL co-localized for SLP and WPLA seems to indicate possibilities for selecting for TR independently from leaf size.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Despite the significant correlations between WPLA and WPSLA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), all of the QTL detected for these traits were distinct, indicating that they do not capture the same physiological processes, therefore offering two distinct sources for breeding drought-tolerant germplasm. Indeed, WPLA represents the total evaporative area of the plant, and is consequently a trait whose variation can lead to drought tolerance in environments requiring evaporative surface adjustment to save water, while WPSLA alternatively encapsulates a drought adaptation strategy that involves maximizing the photosynthetic assimilation per unit leaf area and/or increased early vigor (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Rebetzke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, in comparison to transpiration traits, the high number of medium-effect QTL detected for WPLA and WPSLA in this study makes it relatively more challenging to use these QTL in breeding programs. In such efforts, the focus should be clearly on the major QTL identified for these traits, and especially QWPLA.ucl-5B.</p>

        <title>Both abaxial and adaxial stomata densities have a strong genetic basis but they do not correlate well with whole-plant traits</title>
        <p>A unique characteristic relative to the stomata densities measured in this study was that robust QTL were detected for both the abaxial (SDAB) and adaxial (SDAD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). We did not find previously published QTL data on stomata density for wheat, but our values appear to compare very favorably with the literature dealing with other crops such as rice (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Laza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Further, the stomata density traits were only weakly correlated with the other traits both phenotypically and genetically (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), indicating an independent genetic control. While a strong genetic correlation was observed between SDAD and SDAB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), it is rather surprising that the QTL for SDAD and SDAB were different. This indicates that the abaxial and adaxial sides are not fully controlled by the same genetic and developmental processes and that they do not necessarily carry the same physiological function. However, on the basis of the low significance levels of the correlations between stomata densities and whole-plant water use traits, it doesn&#x2019;t seem that SDAD and/or SDAB capture physiological information relevant to improving yield under drought. Further research, for instance involving gas exchange phenotyping of NILs or genotypes segregating for the region of the major SDAD and SDAB QTL, will certainly help resolve the nature of involvement of stomata densities in whole-plant water use.</p>

        <title>Nocturnal transpiration has a genetic basis in wheat</title>
        <p>One major finding of this investigation was that TRN was highly heritable and controlled by specific loci of the wheat genome. This finding is the first to confirm the hypothesis of existence of a genetic basis of nocturnal transpiration in plants, first established by <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Christman <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> who identified one QTL controlling nocturnal stomata conductance in Arabidopsis. Further, the present finding is unique in that whole-plant night-time transpiration &#x2013; instead of single leaf-based gas exchange &#x2013; was measured over several hours, thereby limiting confounding effects resulting from instantaneous measurements or from measuring single leaf segments.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Another significant finding was that most of the QTL identified for TRN were specific to this trait (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that whole-plant nocturnal transpiration is under the control of distinct physiological processes. However, consistent with <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Christman <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>, SLP and TRN were found to be positively correlated both phenotypically and genetically (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that any selection that operates on daytime TR is likely to influence night-time TR. Given the origin of the genetic material (south Australian drought-adapted parents), this suggests that although limited, TRN might confer some favorable physiological advantage that benefits productivity under drought. In wheat, TRN was found to be non-negligible in south Australian conditions (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Rawson and Clarke, 1988</xref>) and more recently was shown to be under the control of night-time VPD and speculated to be involved in drought tolerance by <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach <italic>et al.</italic> (2014a)</xref>, but the nature of this involvement remains unclear. By uncovering QTL such as QTRN.ucl-5A.2, the present investigation offers a new way to address this challenge. Investigating the physiological basis of TRN variation among NILs for this QTL will unravel the ecophysiological and agronomic value of this trait.</p>

        <title>A complex and differential involvement of phenology genes in regulating transpiration-related traits</title>
        <p>The 143 DH lines that were used in our study were selected from a group that flowered in a narrow window, in order to limit interaction with phenology (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Despite this, the effects of the maturity genes were substantial and different, revealing a much stronger effect of <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> in regulating most of the traits investigated, with the exception of stomata densities. Unexpectedly, the RAC875 alleles for <italic>Ppd-D1</italic> conferred an increase in daytime and night-time transpiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the same allele also conferred a potentially conservative behavior by strongly decreasing whole-plant leaf area (WPLA), further confirming the hypothesis of a trade-off between these two types of traits, as outlined earlier in the discussion. At any rate, these findings confirm the long suspected possibility that both genes have pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cockram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), while suggesting that these effects involve hydraulics and gas exchange response to a major abiotic stress (i.e. VPD). Consistent with <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Pantin <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>, this indicates that at least some of the whole-plant hydraulic and photosynthetic physiological functions are developmentally controlled and therefore are not necessarily expressed identically across the crop cycle. If confirmed, this observation implies that drought tolerance traits evolve with time as the crop grows, which point to the increasing necessity of taking into account such time-dependent effects when modeling or examining the relationship between a putative drought tolerance trait and yield.</p>

        <title>Caveats inherent to phenotyping TR response to increasing VPD</title>
        <p>This investigation revealed two main challenges that need to be considered when phenotyping TR response curves to increasing VPD. The first deals with the caution that should be applied in replicating this type of experiment. Prior to this study, efforts to phenotype the entire population three times at the seedling stage under different conditions using a hydroponic system failed to reveal heritable TR and developmental traits. This led to phenotyping the population with the current protocol, i.e. at a more advanced stage, in large custom-made pots. This protocol appeared to be repeatable since the 2015 validation experiment confirmed the TR responses of eight genotypes that captured the variability in SLP of the entire population. However, as indicated by the strong effects of the maturity genes, it should be noted that replicating the experiment at a later/earlier stage is likely to strongly influence the QTL detection. This also applies to situations where experiments are undertaken under significantly different growth conditions, which were reported to influence the TR vs. VPD curves in a genotype-dependent fashion, on maize (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and wheat (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok, 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">A second challenge deals with the followed approach for imposing the VPD treatments. Unavoidably, the achieved VPD was the result of both variation in T and RH as a function of the time of the day, so that it is impossible to uncouple T, PPFD and VPD effects on TR, similar to other reports (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kholov&#xE1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010, 2012</xref>). Doing so requires phenotyping the entire population in an environment where T and PPFD stay constant, while dramatically varying RH, which is impossible outside a growth chamber. In our experimental setting, the increase in T over time was concomitant with a decrease in RH, while PPFD stayed above saturation levels for most of the sequence. This makes it reasonable to ascribe TR increases largely to increases in T and RH-driven VPD as the main driving force. In a previous investigation (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schoppach and Sadok 2012</xref>), we confirmed the repeatability of this approach over two independent experiments that were carried out each over two successive days in the growth chamber and the greenhouse, despite different light environments where PPFD stayed above 400 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Considering the logistical impossibility of phenotyping the entire population inside a growth chamber and the statistical necessity of characterizing simultaneously all individuals, future phenotyping efforts &#x2013; especially those under naturally fluctuating conditions &#x2013; will have to take into account the above considerations.</p>
