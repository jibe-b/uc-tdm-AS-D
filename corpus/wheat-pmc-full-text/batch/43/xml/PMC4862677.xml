      <abstract>
        <p>In wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.), time from planting to spike emergence is influenced by genes controlling vernalization requirement and photoperiod response. Characterizing the available genetic diversity of known and novel alleles of <italic>VERNALIZATION1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic>) and <italic>PHOTOPERIOD1</italic> (<italic>PPD1</italic>) in winter wheat can inform approaches for breeding climate resilient cultivars. This study identified QTL for heading date (HD) associated with multiple <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>PPD1</italic> loci in a population developed from a cross between two early flowering winter wheat cultivars. When the population was grown in the greenhouse after partial vernalization treatment, major heading date QTLs co-located with the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> loci. Copy number variation at the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> locus influenced HD such that RIL having three copies required longer cold exposure to transition to flowering than RIL having two <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copies. Sequencing <italic>vrn-B1</italic> winter alleles of the parents revealed multiple polymorphisms in the first intron that were the basis of mapping a major HD QTL coinciding with <italic>VRN-B1</italic>. A 36 bp deletion in the first intron of <italic>VRN-B1</italic> was associated with earlier HD after partial vernalization in lines having either two or three haploid copies of <italic>VRN-A1</italic>. The <italic>VRN1</italic> loci interacted significantly and influenced time to heading in field experiments in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. The <italic>PPD1</italic> loci were significant determinants of heading date in the fully vernalized treatment in the greenhouse and in all field environments. Heading date QTL were associated with alleles having large deletions in the upstream regions of <italic>PPD-A1</italic> and <italic>PPD-D1</italic> and with copy number variants at the <italic>PPD-B1</italic> locus. The <italic>PPD-D1</italic> locus was determined to have the largest genetic effect, followed by <italic>PPD-A1</italic> and <italic>PPD-B1</italic>. Our results demonstrate that <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>PPD1</italic> alleles of varying strength allow fine tuning of flowering time in diverse winter wheat growing environments.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is the world&#x2019;s most widely grown crop, accounting for the largest area under cultivation of any single crop [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Plasticity of the flowering pathway in wheat is key to adaptation as it allows for regulation of developmental phases in different environments and accounts for the broad geographical range of wheat cultivation. Selection for the most appropriate developmental pattern to suit growing conditions has contributed to global increases in wheat yields [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As temperature and moisture regimes in wheat production areas change, selection for genes affecting timing of plant developmental phases will be needed to minimize exposure to harsh conditions and to maintain or increase yields.</p>
      <p>Vernalization and photoperiod genes of hexaploid wheat are major regulators of the transition from the vegetative to reproductive growth phase, ensuring that flowering occurs when temperatures are favorable and water is abundant to support growth. Vernalization is defined as the acquisition or acceleration of flowering after exposure to low temperature [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Wheat has both winter and spring growth habits, with winter wheat requiring exposure to chilling temperatures to transition to reproductive growth. In autumn sown wheat, vernalization sensitivity protects the wheat meristems from cold temperatures during winter by delaying flower initiation [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Three groups of genes are reported to regulate vernalization: <italic>VRN1</italic>, <italic>VRN2</italic>, and <italic>VRN3</italic>. <italic>VRN1</italic> is a flowering promoter that remains repressed until it is cold induced [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>VRN2</italic> is a strong repressor of flowering and is downregulated by vernalization and short days [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>VRN3</italic> accelerates the reproductive development of the apex and is induced by long days [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>VRN1</italic> has been reported to be the main flowering signal that promotes the transition of the apex from vegetative to reproductive phase [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Each wheat genome contains a homoeologus copy of <italic>VRN1</italic> designated <italic>VRN-A1</italic>, <italic>VRN-B1</italic>, and <italic>VRN-D1</italic>, located on the long arms of chromosomes 5A, 5B, and 5D, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The presence of a dominant allele in any genome confers spring growth habit, whereas the presence of recessive alleles in the homozygous state across <italic>VRN1</italic> loci confers winter growth habit [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Characterization of the <italic>VRN1</italic> genes at the DNA sequence level [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] identified mutations resulting in spring growth habit. At <italic>VRN-A1</italic>, three distinct mutations in the promoter region (<italic>VRN-A1a</italic>) or intron 1 (<italic>VRN-A1b</italic> and <italic>VRN-A1c</italic>) were reported while large deletions within intron 1 of the <italic>VRN-B1</italic> and <italic>VRN-D1</italic> genes resulted in spring growth habit [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Variations in winter alleles of <italic>VRN1</italic> have recently been associated with differences in the duration of vernalization required to promote flowering of winter wheat. D&#xED;az et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] identified wheat genotypes having one, two and three <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copies and determined that longer periods of exposure to cold were needed to potentiate flowering for plants having an increased copy number. Chen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4 of <italic>vrn-A1</italic> associated with QTL for plant development in winter wheat and designated alleles <italic>vrn-A1a</italic> in early flowering cultivar Jagger and <italic>vrn-A1b</italic> in the cultivar 2174. Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported subsequently that cultivar 2174 had three <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copies and Jagger had one <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copy. They also demonstrated that a SNP in exon 7 resulting in an Ala<sup>180</sup> to Val<sup>180</sup> amino acid mutation in the <italic>vrn-A1</italic> protein decreased its ability to bind with the <italic>Ta</italic>HOX1 protein thought to function in the flowering pathway in winter wheat. The wheat cultivar Claire, having a single <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copy, also carried the exon variants described in Jagger [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Differences in vernalization duration requirement associated with <italic>VRN-B1</italic> were reported in a RIL population from the cross AGS 2000&#xD7; NC-Neuse. A SNP in intron one of <italic>vrn-B1</italic> was the basis of mapping a major QTL for heading date after exposure to four weeks of vernalization treatment, but this variant was not predicted to affect expression of <italic>vrn-B1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>Photoperiod response is also a critical factor affecting the flowering time and adaptation of wheat. In photoperiod sensitive wheat, flowering is accelerated by exposure to long days. Globally, wheat photoperiod insensitivity is widespread in areas where the crop is grown during short days or where wheat maturity is required before the onset of high summer temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Once vernalization requirement of winter wheat is fulfilled, cultivars those are insensitive to photoperiod switch to reproductive growth as spring temperatures increase. Photoperiod response in wheat is mainly controlled by the <italic>PHOTOPERIOD1</italic> (<italic>PPD1)</italic> loci located on the short arms of chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D. <italic>PPD1</italic> genes identified in wheat and barley are members of the pseudo response regulator (PRR) family [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Large deletions upstream of <italic>PPD1</italic> genes in each of the wheat genomes have been reported to decreased sensitivity to photoperiod [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Copy number variation has also been detected at the <italic>PPD-B1</italic> locus with increased gene numbers leading to earlier flowering [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Dominant alleles confer photoperiod insensitivity and are designated by the suffix &#x201C;a&#x201D; whereas sensitive alleles are designated by the suffix &#x201C;b&#x201D;. The <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> allele having a 2,089 bp deletion in the promoter region [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] is widely considered the most potent allele for photoperiod insensitivity, followed by the <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> and <italic>PPD-A1a</italic> alleles [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>Characterization of <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>PPD1</italic> alleles, their relative effects, and interactions is needed to further our understanding of regulation of developmental phases of winter wheat to suit variable environments. The aim of the current study was to investigate the genetic control of heading date in a cross between commercial winter wheat cultivars adapted to the mild winters of the southern U.S. Both parents of our recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population, cultivars AGS 2000 and Pioneer variety 26R61 (hereafter referred to as 26R61), are early flowering cultivars. A densely populated linkage map of the population that included allele specific markers for the <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>PPD1</italic> loci was used for QTL mapping. The RILs were grown in the greenhouse after different vernalization treatments to identify QTL associated with differences in heading date (HD) associated with vernalization requirement duration. The population was also evaluated at environments in Louisiana, Georgia, and North Carolina to determine the effect of the observed HD QTL in the field and to identify other genes influencing maturity.</p>

        <p>In this study, 175 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between soft winter wheat cultivars AGS 2000 (PI612956) and 26R61 (PI612153) described by Hao et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were evaluated for heading date in both the field and greenhouse. Near isogenic line (NIL) from two F<sub>7</sub> RILs, AP37 and AP129, for which flowering time variation was observed after partial vernalization treatment were derived as follows. Seeds from each greenhouse plant were harvested separately then sown in single one-meter long rows in the field at Raleigh, NC during fall 2013. At the booting stage, tissue was collected from ten individually tagged plants in each row and DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Samples were evaluated with markers for the <italic>PPD-A1</italic>, <italic>PPD-B1</italic>, <italic>PPD-D1</italic>, <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154242.t001">Table 1</xref>) and heads from the tagged plants were harvested. Seeds from a single head of plants derived from the same RIL having identical homozygous genotypes at all <italic>PPD1</italic> loci and contrasting genotypes for either the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> or <italic>VRN-B1</italic> locus were selected and seed of NIL pairs increased in the greenhouse.</p>

        <title>Phenotypic Evaluation</title>
        <p>The effect of vernalization on flowering was evaluated on the RIL population and the parents in the greenhouse after being vernalized for 8 weeks (8W), 4 weeks (4W) or 2 weeks (2W) at 4&#xB0;C. The vernalization process was performed by germinating seeds in paper towels modified with a wick that was partially immersed in distilled water to maintain saturation. After vernalization, seedlings were transplanted into black plastic Containers (Stuewe &amp; Sons, Tangent, Oregon USA) (D40: Volume 0.7L, 6.5 cm in diameter and 25 cm depth) containing 1:1 Metro Mix 2 and soil and 2 g of slow release fertilizer (Multicote 14-14-16, N-P-K) was incorporated into the soil. Six plants per entry/treatment combination were grown in a completely randomized design in a greenhouse with 16 hrs photoperiod and 20/15&#xB0;C day/night temperature. Heading date was recorded when plants were at Zadocks 59 growth stage [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
        <p>Germinated seed of F<sub>7</sub> derived NIL pairs and parents were vernalized for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. Ten seedlings of each line were then transplanted into black plastic containers and grown in the greenhouse as described above. Heading date was recorded when the first head completely emerged at Zadocks 59 growth stage. ANOVA was conducted to test for heading time differences between the NIL pairs and parent lines.</p>
        <p>Heading date was evaluated on the RILs, along with parents, grown at field locations including Raleigh, NC (Latitude: 35.73&#xB0;; Longitude: -78.68&#xB0;; Elevation: 116.5 m) in harvest years 2012, 2013 and 2014, and Plains, GA (Latitude: 32.05&#xB0;; Longitude: -84.37&#xB0;; Elevation: 150 m) and Baton Rouge, LA (Latitude: 30.54&#xB0;; Longitude: -91.15&#xB0;; Elevation: 20 m) in 2012. Three grams of seed of each RIL and parents were planted in 1.5 m rows in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Heading date was recorded as day of year in all environments when 50% of the plants in a plot were at Zadocks 59 growth stage [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

        <title>Genotyping</title>
        <p>The AGS 2000 x 26R61 RIL population was previously genotyped using SSR markers and DArT genetic markers as described by Hao et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were also evaluated on the population using the Illumina iSelect array for wheat described by Cavanagh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A total 2833 polymorphic markers were identified.</p>
        <p>Genotypes of parents, RILs and NILs for major vernalization and photoperiod loci were determined using competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154242.t001">Table 1</xref>). KASP assays for different winter alleles of the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> loci and for detection of insensitive alleles of the <italic>PPD-B1</italic> and <italic>PPD-D1</italic> loci were performed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A new KASP assay was designed for <italic>VRN-A1</italic> that targeted the recently reported <italic>TaGRP2</italic> RIP-3 binding site mutation [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A new assay targeting the large insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter of <italic>PPD-A1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was also developed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154242.t001">Table 1</xref>). KASP reactions were setup in a 5 &#x3BC;L reaction containing 2.5 &#x3BC;L 2X KASP Master Mix, 0.07 &#x3BC;L 72X Assay mix (containing allele specific and common primers), and 2.5 &#x3BC;L of gDNA (~ 30&#x2013;50 ng/&#x3BC;L). PCR cycling conditions were programmed according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (LGC Genomics, Middlesex, UK) and endpoint genotyping was conducted using a Pherastar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Otenberg, Germany) and the software Klustercaller (LGC Genomics, Middlesex, UK).</p>

        <title>Map construction and QTL analyses</title>
        <p>A chi-square test was performed to test for goodness-of-fit of markers to an expected ratio of 1:1. Linkage mapping was performed using QTL ICIMapping V4.0 [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isbreeding.net/">http://www.isbreeding.net/</ext-link>). The BIN tool was implemented to identify and remove redundant markers in the dataset and also remove markers with high levels of missing data. Linkage groups were created using the &#x201C;Grouping&#x201D; tool and were selected based on minimum LOD score of 4. Marker distances in cM were calculated using the Kosambi function and the &#x201C;nearest neighbor algorithm&#x201D; option. Linkage group identity and order were assigned based on evaluation of similarities to published linkage maps available in GrainGenes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheat.pw.usda.gov">http://wheat.pw.usda.gov</ext-link>) and the SNP map of Cavanagh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Retained and mapped markers were used for QTL analyses. Single environment QTL analysis was conducted for each vernalization treatment by the method of inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) in QTL IciMapping ver. 4.0. LOD thresholds for QTL detection were determined by 1000 permutations QTLs with epistatic effects were detected by selecting ICIM-EPI with a probability value for entering variables (PIN) of 0.0001. The default LOD of 3.0 for ICIM-EPI was used to detect epistatic QTLs. Epistatic effects of significant QTL were calculated with the software R version 1.32&#x2013;6 [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. An additional analysis was performed by grouping lines into classes according to their genotypic status at the VRN1 and PPD1 loci. An analysis of variance fitting genotypic class as a fixed main effect was done for each environment separately using Proc GLM in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The average least difference comparing any two classes was computed for each environment.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA of AGS 2000 and 26R61 were used to amplify the 13 kb <italic>VRN-B1</italic> gene by parts. Five genome specific PCR primer pairs and 25 sequencing primers were designed from the <italic>vrn-B1</italic> Triple Dirk C (AY747604) sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154242.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154242.s005">S2</xref> Tables). PCR amplification was done in a 50 &#x3BC;L volume containing 34.05 &#x3BC;L distilled water, 5 &#x3BC;L of 10x high fidelity buffer (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), 6 &#x3BC;L dNTPs (2.5 mM), 2.0 &#x3BC;L of premixed forward and reverse primers (10 &#x3BC;M), 0.75 &#x3BC;L dimethyl sulfoxide, 2 &#x3BC;L MgSO<sub>4</sub> (50 mM), 0.20 &#x3BC;L Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and 400 ng of gDNA. The PCR program was: 95&#xB0;C for 3 min, followed by 94&#xB0;C for 30 s, annealing at 65&#xB0;C for 30 s, and extension at 68&#xB0;C for 6 min (6 kb amplicon), 3 min (2.5 kb and 1.75 kb amplicons), or 1 min (860 bp amplicon) depending on the expected amplicon size. The annealing temperature was reduced by 1&#xB0;C for every additional cycle until 55&#xB0;C. Finally, 25 cycles were done at 94&#xB0;C for 30 s, 55&#xB0;C for 30 s, 68&#xB0;C for 6 min, 3 min, or 1 min depending on the expected amplicon size. PCR amplicons were then purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) to remove residue PCR primers. The purified PCR amplicons were either sequenced directly or cloned into cloning vector <italic>pCR 2</italic>.<italic>1 TOPO</italic> (Invitrogen) for Sanger sequencing. Sequences from the cultivars were assembled into individual contigs using the CAP3 sequence assembly program. The assembled contigs were then blasted against the Triple Dirk C v<italic>rn-A1 (</italic>AY747600), <italic>vrn-B1 (</italic>AY747604), and <italic>vrn-D1</italic> (AY747606) genes to verify homology to the <italic>vrn-B1</italic> gene sequence.

        <p>Vernalization and photoperiod gene copy number estimates were determined using <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>PPD-B1</italic> TaqMan<sup>&#xAE;</sup> assays previously described by D&#xED;az et al.[<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and a <italic>VRN-B1</italic> TaqMan<sup>&#xAE;</sup> assay developed in this study (forward primer: 5&#x2019;-<monospace><italic>CAGCATTCATCCAGCGGCAT</italic></monospace>-3&#x2019;, reverse primer: 5&#x2019;-<monospace><italic>CTTCAGCCGTTGATGTGGCTA</italic></monospace>-3&#x2019;, probe primer: Fam\5&#x2019;-<monospace><italic>CAGAGGATGCGGCAGTGCAG</italic></monospace>-3&#x2019;\TAMARA). The <italic>VRN-B1</italic> TaqMan<sup>&#xAE;</sup> assay was designed around an intron and exon junction at exon 8 that presented sufficient sequence variation for designing a genome specific assay. The <italic>VRN-B1</italic> TaqMan<sup>&#xAE;</sup> assay genome specificity and copy number differences were confirmed using genomic DNA isolated from Chinese Spring nullisomic-ditelosomic (N5B-D5A + Dt5AL) and nullisomic-tetrasomic (N5D-T5B) lines. The cultivars Claire, Malacca, and Hereward were used as controls for determining <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copy number. Cultivars Chinese Spring and Alchemy were used as controls to evaluate <italic>PPD-B1</italic> copy number differences.</p>
        <p>Copy number assays were conducted in 10 &#x3BC;L reaction volume consisting of 5 &#x3BC;L 5X TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Invitrogen), 1 &#x3BC;L of premixed gene specific primers (3 &#x3BC;M forward, 3 &#x3BC;M reverse, and 2 &#x3BC;M probe), 1 &#x3BC;L of premixed <italic>TaCO</italic> internal control primes (2 &#x3BC;M forward, 2 &#x3BC;M reverse, and 1 &#x3BC;M probe), 1 &#x3BC;L diH<sub>2</sub>0, and 2 &#x3BC;L standardized DNA. Quantitative PCR was conducted in a Roche LightCycler LC 480 programmed to start heating at 95&#xB0;C for 10 min follow by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95&#xB0;C for 15 s and 60&#xB0;C annealing and extension for 1 min. PCR cycle threshold (Ct) was determined for the gene of interest and the single copy gene <italic>TaCO</italic> was used for normalization. Copy number was estimated by taking the target and control gene ratio 2<sup>-(Target Ct&#x2014;Control Ct)</sup> for at least ten technical replicates for the parent and control lines and four technical replicates for the RILs. ANOVA analysis was conducted to determine copy number difference between the parents and control lines.</p>

        <p>Although none of the reported mutations in wheat <italic>VRN1</italic> genes leading to spring growth habit were observed in either parent, polymorphism between AGS 2000 and 26R61 was observed for the winter alleles of vernalization loci <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154242.t001">Table 1</xref>). Polymorphism was observed for KASP marker designed around a SNP in exon 4 of <italic>vrn-A1</italic> reported by D&#xED;az et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. No polymorphism was detected at <italic>vrn-A1</italic> exon 7 previously associated with reduced vernalization or the intron 1 <italic>TaGRP2</italic> RIP-3 binding site. TaqMan<sup>&#xAE;</sup> assays showed that 26R61 had a haploid copy number of two and cultivars AGS 2000 and NC-Neuse were estimated to have a <italic>VRN-A1</italic> haploid copy number of three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154242.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The control lines Claire, Malacca, and Hereward were determined to have <italic>VRN-A1</italic> haploid copy numbers of one, two and three, respectively, as previously demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. When the RILs were evaluated for <italic>VRN-A1</italic> gene copy, 118 RILs were estimated to have a haploid copy of two and 57 RILs were estimated to have a haploid copy of three. Genotyping of the population with the exon 4 KASP assay was in agreement and also indicated an excess of the <italic>vrn-A1</italic> allele from 26R61 (2 haploid copies).</p>
        <p>Evaluation with the <italic>TaVrnB1_1752</italic> SNP in the first intron of <italic>VRN-B1</italic> reported to be associated with differences in vernalization duration requirement [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] revealed polymorphism between AGS 2000 and 26R61. To determine if <italic>VRN-B1</italic> copy number variation was present, a TaqMan<sup>&#xAE;</sup> assay specific to <italic>VRN-B1</italic> was developed. The Chinese Spring nullisomic5D-tetrasomic5B line used as a control was estimated to have two haploid copies and was different (<italic>p &lt; 0</italic>.<italic>0001</italic>) from AGS 2000, 26R61, and NC-Neuse that were all estimated to have one haploid copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154242.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To identify polymorphisms in the winter <italic>vrn-B1</italic> alleles, sequenced amplicons from AGS 2000 and 26R61 were assembled into individual contigs spanning 12,858 bp and 12,902 bp respectively. The assembled genes share 99% homology to the winter <italic>vrn-B1</italic> (AY747604) and less than 94% homology to <italic>vrn-A1</italic> (AY747600) and <italic>vrn-D1</italic> (AY747606). Alignments detected SNP upstream of the promoter regions, in intron 5, and the 3&#x2019; UTR region. The most extensive variation was observed within the first intron having 35 SNPs and 4 INDELs, including a 36 bp deletion in AGS 2000 that spans from nucleotide interval positions 5400 bp to 5436 bp relative to the Triple Dirk C <italic>vrn-B1</italic> (AY747604) sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154242.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). No sequence variation was detected between exonic regions or the remaining introns. A new marker TaVrn-B1_5400 was developed around the 36 bp deletion in intron 1 that co-segregated with the TaVrnB1_1752 SNP assay in the RIL population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154242.t001">Table 1</xref>). Observed segregation for the two markers at the <italic>Vrn-B1</italic> locus did not differ from the 1:1 ratio expected. The allele carrying the 36 bp deletion in AGS 2000 is hereafter referred to as <italic>vrn-B1_del</italic> and the intact allele from 26R61 as <italic>vrn-B1_non-del</italic>.</p>

        <title>Effect of vernalization treatments on heading date</title>
        <p>Winter wheat cultivars AGS 2000 and 26R61 responded to the vernalization duration treatments used in this study. Heading date decreased significantly for both cultivars as the length of the vernalization treatment increased from 2W to 8W. Significant differences in HD between AGS 2000 and 26R61 were not observed after 8W and 4W of vernalization. However, after 2W vernalization 26R61 headed 10 days later than AGS 2000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154242.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Although HD of the AGS 2000 and 26R61 parents were similar in the 4W and 8W vernalization treatment, a broad range in HD was observed in the RIL population in all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154242.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The greatest range in HD for the population was observed after 4W of vernalization (63 to 137 days) followed by the 2W treatment (87 to 144 days). Analysis of variance indicated significant effects of genotypes, treatments, and genotype x treatment interaction (<italic>p &lt;0</italic>.<italic>001</italic>). QTL analyses were therefore done separately for each treatment.</p>

However, the largest decrease in HD was observed for NIL AP37E after four weeks of vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154242.g004">Fig 4</xref>). No significant HD difference was detected between the parent lines at 0W, 4W, and 8W vernalization (data not shown). AGS 2000 headed earlier than 26R61 in the 2W treatment, consistent with observations in conjunction with the RIL population. However, AGS 2000 was nine days later than 26R61 in the 6W vernalization treatment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Winter wheat production extends north-south across most of the United States and breeding programs located in each state develop cultivars that are best suited to their specific set of target environments. In this study we investigated the genetic control of HD in a population derived from a cross between two winter wheat cultivars adapted to the southeastern United States. This production region is characterized by short periods of exposure to cold temperatures during winter that can be variable from year to year. In these environments, it is advantageous for plants to complete grain filling before the onset of high summer temperatures. Thus, selection for early maturity has been an important criteria for cultivar development. However, early flowering increases the risk of damage to sensitive floral structures and yield losses due to late spring freezes. Our analyses indicate that genetic variation at the major vernalization and photoperiod loci allows winter wheat breeders in these southern locations to time plant developmental stages to suit environmental conditions.</p>
      <p>Winter wheat vernalization requirements can be variable requiring shorter or longer duration of cold exposure to induce flowering. Thus, critical flowering loci that are regulated by environmental factors are expected to interact variably across a range of environments that vary in intensity and duration of cold temperatures during winter. In our study, QTL by environment interaction was observed for the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> loci. In the greenhouse experiment, the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> loci did not have significant effect on HD in plants where vernalization requirement was satisfied by eight weeks of cold exposure. However, in the partial vernalization treatments (2W and 4W), QTL associated with <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> were each highly significant and together explained most of the variation in heading. Significant effects on HD were also observed when the populations were grown at field locations Baton Rouge, LA (Latitude: 30.54&#xB0;), Plains, GA (Latitude: 32.05&#xB0;) and Raleigh, NC (Latitude: 35.73&#xB0;). Variation in winter and early spring temperatures were observed across years and locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154242.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and vernalization gene effects were greatest during the warmer winter and early spring of 2012. However, significant differences in HD were associated with the <italic>VRN1</italic> loci across all years and locations.</p>
      <p>Vernalization requirement differences associated with the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> locus have been attributed to either mutations in coding sequences [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or copy number differences [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The nonsynonymous mutation in exon 7 associated with early flowering in the cultivar Jagger [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was not present in the 26R61 <italic>vrn-A1_2-copy</italic> allele in this study, as both parents carry the T nucleotide at this position. A study by Xiao et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] determined that <italic>TaGRP2</italic>, an RNA binding protein, negatively regulates <italic>VRN1</italic> by directly binding to critical regions in the first intron. Recent characterization of the <italic>VRN-D4</italic> locus, which arose by duplication of <italic>VRN-A1</italic>, identified SNP in the conserved <italic>TaGRP2</italic> RIP-3 region that disrupts TaGRP2 binding to <italic>VRN1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These same SNP were found in the common wheat cultivars Jagger and Claire, each of which has a single <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copy and reduced vernalization requirement. In the current study, a KASP assay designed to detect the SNP in the RIP-3 region did not reveal differences between the parents of our mapping population that both have the Triple Dirk C haplotype [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We did however, observe differences between AGS 2000 and 26R61 in exon 4 as well as gene copy number differences. D&#xED;az et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] determined that plants with increased <italic>VRN-A1</italic> copy number have an increased vernalization duration requirement such that longer periods of cold exposure were required to potentiate flowering. Similarly, we observed that the <italic>vrn-A1_3-copy</italic> allele was associated with later HD after partial vernalization in the greenhouse and at all field locations.</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that the <italic>vrn-B1_del</italic> allele from AGS 2000 is associated with reduced vernalization requirement in lines having either two or three haploid copies of <italic>VRN-A1</italic>. The <italic>vrn-B1_del</italic> allele does not confer spring growth habit as lines having this variant are responsive to cold treatment. Four weeks of vernalization treatment accelerated heading in AGS 2000 and in the AP129E NIL having v<italic>rn-B1_del</italic> by 25 and 31 days, respectively, compared with non-vernalized plants. The mechanisms contributing to differences in vernalization requirement associated with the <italic>VRN-B1</italic> locus are not clear. The dominant <italic>VRN1</italic> genes have structural variations at critical promoter elements and large deletions in intron 1, which leads to loss of vernalization requirement [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Polymorphisms between AGS 2000 and 26R61 <italic>vrn-B1</italic> were not detected in regions thought to cause vernalization differences. Our comparative sequence analysis did not detect polymorphism between <italic>vrn-B1</italic> alleles at the TaGRP2 RIP-3 region or other known regulatory sites. In addition, polymorphism was not detected in exonic regions. AGS 2000 and 26R61 both had a single haploid <italic>VRN-B1</italic> copy, suggesting that flowering time variation was not due to gene dosage. The 36 bp deletion in intron 1 of the <italic>vrn-B1_del</italic> allele may play a role in reducing vernalization requirement. However, it is also possible that acceleration of flowering by short exposure to cold in this case is conferred by some yet to be described mechanism or is due to a linked locus. The Phytochrome C loci are located near the <italic>VRN1</italic> genes on group 5 chromosomes and have been shown to play a role in acceleration of flowering under long days [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>The relative effects of <italic>VRN-A1</italic> and <italic>VRN-B1</italic> on HD in this study depended on the length of cold treatment. <italic>VRN-A1</italic> explained a larger percentage of variation in HD than <italic>VRN-B1</italic> and had a larger additive effect after 4W of cold treatment. In contrast, after two weeks of cold, the <italic>VRN-B1</italic> locus was most significant and had a larger additive effect (9.8 days) than <italic>VRN-A1</italic> (3.3 days). In addition, mean HD differences between the <italic>VRN-B1</italic> NIL pair were larger than that observed for the <italic>VRN-A1</italic> NIL pair in all partial vernalization treatments, particularly after the 2W treatment (33 days versus 20 days). These data suggest the 5B QTL region from AGS 2000 leads to more rapid transition to reproductive growth after short periods of exposure to cold temperatures than the <italic>vrn-A1_2-copy</italic> allele. Results of QTL analysis of the RIL population in the field are consistent with this observation. The difference in HD overserved at the LA12 environment for RIL having contrasting <italic>VRN-B1</italic> alleles (7 days) was twice the difference for RIL having contrasting <italic>VRN-A1</italic> alleles (3.4 days). However, at the NC locations, where plants were exposed to more cold days during winter, <italic>VRN-B1</italic> effects were smaller than that observed for <italic>VRN-A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154242.t005">Table 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this population, the number of RILs having two <italic>vrn-A1</italic> copies was almost twice that of lines having three <italic>vrn-A1</italic> copies. Selection again the <italic>vrn-A1_3-copy</italic> allele may have occurred during single seed descent of the mapping population. Plants were given four to six weeks of vernalization treatment in each generation of inbreeding, which was adequate to induce flowering in the parents and allowed for rapid population advancement. However, these shorter duration vernalization treatments would have resulted in delayed flowering of plants having the <italic>vrn-B1_non-del</italic> and <italic>vrn-A1-3-copy</italic> allele combination. Interestingly, significant segregation distortion of <italic>vrn-B1</italic> alleles was not observed. Thus, the cumulative effects of selection against very late flowering lines were greater for the VRN-A1 than the VRN-B1 locus.</p>
      <p>In contrast with the QTL associated with the <italic>VRN1</italic> loci, direction and relative effects of the different <italic>PPD1</italic> insensitive genes were consistent across field environments although the magnitude of genetic effects varied. In all cases, the <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> insensitive allele had the greatest effect on early HD, followed by the <italic>PPD-A1a</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and the <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> alleles. The 26R61 parent of our population has the major <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> allele associated with a 2,089 bp deletion in the region upstream of the gene [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> allele was reported to have the largest genetic effect on accelerating flowering time in current European wheat cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>Comparison of the potency of <italic>PPD1</italic> genes in the literature can be complicated as recent molecular characterization has shown that multiple alleles are present at each locus [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The B-genome locus is particularly variable, with <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> alleles arising due to structural variation in the 5&#x2019; upstream region [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as well as multiple gene duplication events leading to copy number variation [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some studies showed that the <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> gene with a 308 bp insertion in the upstream region could be as strong as <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> under short photoperiod conditions [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The AGS 2000 parent of our population has the <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> allele associated with the Sonora/Timstein intercopy junction type and was estimated to have three gene copies. D&#xED;az et al. [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] determined that an early flowering day neutral phenotype was associated with increased copy number of <italic>PPD-B1</italic>. In our study the three copy <italic>PPD-B1</italic> variant was associated with earlier heading date. However, the effect of <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> on HD in our population was consistently smaller than that observed for <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> and <italic>PPD-A1a</italic>. The <italic>PPD-A1a</italic> allele in AGS 2000 is characterized by a 1,085 bp deletion in the critical upstream region that was first reported in a Hokkaido cultivar &#x2018;Chihokukomugi&#x2019; from Japan and designated as <italic>PPD-A1a</italic>.<italic>1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0154242.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Acceleration of heading due to the <italic>PPD-A1a</italic>.<italic>1</italic> allele in our population was intermediate to <italic>PPD-D1a</italic> and <italic>PPD-B1a</italic>. RIL having both <italic>PPD-A1a</italic> and <italic>PPD-B1a</italic> were generally earlier than RIL having either insensitive allele singly. However, RIL having multiple insensitive alleles were not significantly earlier than RIL possessing only <italic>PPD-D1a</italic>.</p>
      <p>The widespread use of photoperiod insensitive alleles in winter wheat results in plants that are able to transition to flowering as soon as vernalization requirement is satisfied. In our experiment, this phenomenon was most apparent at the environments having the warmest winter/early spring temperatures. Although the experiment was conducted at the same NC location for three years, mean HD of the population was 18 and 26 days earlier at NC12 than NC13 and NC14, respectively. Not only were effects of vernalization loci larger in NC12, the genetic effects associated with the <italic>PPD1</italic> genes were also larger. The RIL population was not large enough to provide a good assessment of interactions among the five <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>PPD1</italic> genes segregating; however, some interesting interactions could be observed. At the LA12 and GA12 locations, 17 and 10 RIL, respectively, did not flower prior to the end of the experiments. Inspection of the multi-locus genotype data revealed that these extremely late RIL had the <italic>vrn-A1_3-copy</italic> and <italic>vrn-B1_non-del</italic> allele combination or had photoperiod sensitive alleles at all three <italic>PPD1</italic> loci in combination with one with one or both the <italic>vrn-A1_3-copy</italic> or <italic>vrn-B1_non-del</italic> alleles. Interestingly, photoperiod sensitive RIL having the both short vernalization alleles (<italic>vrn-A1_2-copy</italic> and <italic>vrn-B1_non-del</italic>) reached heading prior to the end of the experiments. These results implicate an important role of vernalization genes in control of plant development in these environments.</p>
      <p>Allelic variation across two <italic>VRN1</italic> and three <italic>PPD1</italic> loci resulted in quantitative variation for heading date in our population. These data provide further evidence for the critical role of gene dosage and structural variation at <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>PPD1</italic> in timing of developmental stages in winter wheat in response to environmental cues. In order to define strategic breeding approaches to develop wheat cultivars adapted to growing regions experiencing warmer or more variable environments, it is important to assess the range of flowering time variation available to winter wheat breeders by characterizing the alleles of genes that modulate flowering time.</p>
