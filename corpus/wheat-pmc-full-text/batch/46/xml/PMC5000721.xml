      <abstract>
        <p>The Hessian fly, <italic>Mayetiola destructor</italic>, is a destructive pest of wheat worldwide and mainly controlled by deploying resistant cultivars. In this study, we investigated the genes that were expressed differentially between larvae in resistant plants and those in susceptible plants through RNA sequencing on the Illumina platform. Informative genes were 11,832, 14,861, 15,708, and 15,071 for the comparisons between larvae in resistant versus susceptible plants for 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 days, respectively, after larvae had reached the feeding site. The transcript abundance corresponding to 5401, 6902, 8457, and 5202 of the informative genes exhibited significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &#x2264; 0.05) in the respective paired comparisons. Overall, genes involved in nutrient metabolism, RNA and protein synthesis exhibited lower transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants, indicating that resistant plants inhibited nutrient metabolism and protein production in larvae. Interestingly, the numbers of cytochrome P450 genes with higher transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants were comparable to, or higher than those with lower transcript abundance, indicating that toxic chemicals from resistant plants may have played important roles in Hessian fly larval death. Our study also identified several families of genes encoding secreted salivary gland proteins (SSGPs) that were expressed at early stage of 1<sup>st</sup> instar larvae and with more genes with higher transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants. Those SSGPs are candidate effectors with important roles in plant manipulation.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The Hessian fly, <italic>Mayetiola destructor</italic>, is a parasitic pest of wheat plants and causes serious yield loss in nearly all wheat regions in USA, North Africa, and Europe [<xref rid="B1-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Like biotrophic plant pathogens, the Hessian fly interacts with wheat in a typical gene-for-gene relationship, namely, for every resistance (R) gene in the host plant, there is a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen or insect parasite [<xref rid="B4-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. So far, 34 R genes have been identified and are named <italic>H1</italic> to <italic>H32</italic>, <italic>Hdic</italic>, and <italic>H34</italic> [<xref rid="B6-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All 34 R genes are dominant except <italic>h4</italic>, which is recessive, and all are single effective genes except for <italic>H7H8</italic>, which need to be together to be effective. No Hessian fly R gene in wheat has been cloned and characterized. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Hessian fly R genes share structural similarity with plant disease R genes and belong to the super-group of receptor-like kinases which possess a nucleotide binding site and leucine zip repeats. Two Hessian fly Avr genes have been cloned and characterized [<xref rid="B7-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These Avr genes encode secreted proteins that are likely injected into plant tissue through saliva during feeding. Except for the presence of a typical secretion signal peptide, the structures of the two identified Avr proteins are completely different, and therefore, are likely to perform different functions.</p>
      <p>In order to live and develop in a host plant, Hessian fly larvae need to manipulate the host plant extensively, including inhibiting plant growth, inducing the formation of nutritive cells, and preventing secondary infestation by microbes that may kill the plant [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The exact molecular mechanisms for Hessian fly larvae to manipulate host plants is not known. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Hessian fly larvae manipulate plants through the secretion of saliva that contains effector proteins. Through analyses of dissected salivary glands and genome sequencing, nearly two thousand genes were identified encoding secreted salivary gland proteins (SSGPs). The large number of SSGP-encoding genes can be classified into super-families and families based on their evolutionary relationship. A few families of SSGP genes are very big with more than 500 members. Evidence also suggests that SSGP genes are frequently duplicating and diversifying. Members from the same super-family or family share a so called unconventional conservation pattern, in which the 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;-untranslated regions, the region encoding the secretion signal peptide, and introns are highly conserved whereas the regions encoding mature proteins are highly diversified [<xref rid="B11-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This type of unconventional conservation is likely formed under high selection pressure that selects mutated SSGPs, which may allow Hessian fly to overcome plant resistance. Indeed, plant resistance to Hessian fly conferred by individual R genes is short-lived, lasting for only 6&#x2013;8 years after an R gene is deployed to the field [<xref rid="B13-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Even though numerous SSGP genes have been identified, the specific function and importance of individual SSGP genes that allows Hessian fly to parasitize wheat plants are not yet known. To identify potential key SSGP genes for further research, we hypothesize that the expression of those putative effector genes critical for Hessian fly to manipulate host plants should be elevated when Hessian fly larvae feed in resistant plants. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to examine SSGP genes expressed differentially between Hessian fly larvae feeding in resistant plants and those feeding in susceptible plants via RNAseq, and to identify potentially critical effector genes for further genetic research.</p>
      <p>Hessian fly is mainly controlled by developing and deploying resistant wheat cultivars. Resistance in wheat to Hessian fly is by antibiosis, namely, Hessian fly larvae become physically inactive in resistant wheat after 4&#x2013;5 days and eventually die before developing into second instars [<xref rid="B3-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The exact mechanisms that cause Hessian fly larvae to die in resistant plants is not yet known. Different types of defensive, toxic chemicals such as protease inhibitors, reactive oxygen species, toxic lectins, and secondary metabolites were induced specifically in resistant plants upon Hessian fly larval attack [<xref rid="B14-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, Hessian fly larvae may die due to the toxicity of the defense chemicals from host plants. On the other hand, larvae from resistant plants can survive once they are transferred onto susceptible plants [<xref rid="B19-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The cell wall is promptly strengthened in resistant plants in response to Hessian fly larval attack, and no nutritive cells are formed at the feeding site in these plants [<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These observations indicate that the death of Hessian fly larvae in resistant plants may be due to the lack of nutrients. We hypothesize that changes in gene expression in larval feeding in resistant plants reflect differences in insect physiology, and identification of those genes will reveal the mechanism for Hessian fly larval death. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to identify changes in gene expression and pathways that could help to infer molecular mechanisms for Hessian fly larval death in resistant plants.</p>

      <title>2. Results</title>
      <p>Samples from 0.5-, 1-, 3-, and 5-day larvae feeding in either resistant (wheat cultivar &#x201C;Molly&#x201D;) or susceptible (wheat cultivar &#x201C;Newton&#x201D;) plants were subjected to mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Three biological replicates for each time point were conducted. On average 33.5 million of 2 &#xD7; 101 bp paired-end raw reads per sample were obtained. The raw reads were processed as described previously [<xref rid="B21-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and were mapped to the Hessian fly draft genome sequence (Mdes20100623, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/Mayetiola_destructor">https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/Mayetiola_destructor</uri>) [<xref rid="B22-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] via GSNAP, an intron-aware aligner [<xref rid="B23-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A total of 18,593 informative gene models (defined in the Methods and referred to as genes hereafter) were identified.</p>
      <sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-17-01324">
        <title>2.1. Changes in Overall Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Transcript abundance of informative genes was compared pair-wise between samples from larvae in resistant plants and those in susceptible plants at the same time. At 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 days, 11,832, 14,861, 15,708, and 15,071 genes were informative for the comparisons between larvae feeding in resistant versus susceptible plants, respectively. The transcript abundance corresponding to 5401, 6902, 8457, and 5202 of the informative genes exhibited significant differences between these paired samples at 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Further analysis revealed that the percentages of genes with higher transcript abundance in larvae feeding in resistant plants were slightly lower than the percentages of genes with lower transcript abundance, except for the sample from 5-day larvae, in which a much greater percentage of genes exhibited higher transcript in the larval sample from resistant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition, the transcript abundance of the informative genes was also compared pair-wise between two successive insect stages fed on the same host, namely, samples from 1- versus 0.5-day larvae, 3- versus 1-day larvae, and 5- versus 3-day larvae fed in either resistant or susceptible plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The numbers of informative genes were 11,138, 15,530, and 16,532 for the comparisons between 1- versus 0.5-day, 3- versus 1-day, and 5- versus 3-day larvae feeding in resistant plants; and 10,957, 15,635, and 14,886 for the comparisons between 1- versus 0.5-day, 3- versus 1-day, and 5- versus 3-day larvae feeding in susceptible plants. Transcript abundance corresponding to 1143, 3640, and 4038 of the informative genes exhibited significant differences (5% FDR) between samples of 1- versus 0.5-day, 3- versus 1-day, and 5- versus 3-day of larvae feeding in resistant plants. Transcript abundance corresponding to 821, 7254, and 6080 of the informative genes exhibited significant differences (5% FDR) between samples of 1- versus 0.5-day, 3- versus 1-day, and 5- versus 3-day larvae feeding in susceptible plants, respectively. For the larvae feeding in resistant plants, the percentages of genes with significant changes in expression increased gradually as larvae advanced into later stages. Larvae feeding in susceptible plants, however, had percentages of genes with significant changes in gene expression increased dramatically when larvae advanced from 1- to 3-days.</p>

        <title>2.2. Changes in Gene Expression in Specific Functional Categories</title>
        <p>To determine what types of genes were up- or down-regulated between samples, the 18,593 informative genes were annotated based on BLASTX search results as described previously [<xref rid="B21-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and were updated when this paper was prepared. Based on updated gene annotation, 10,477 (56.3%) of the informative genes had matches with Genbank sequences with <italic>E</italic>-values &#x2264; 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;30</sup>. Among the matched genes, 9760 (53.5% of the total informative genes) had known functions, whereas the remaining (3.9%) had unknown functions (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01324">Table S1</xref>). Genes with known functions were divided into eight functional categories based on their Gene Ontology (GO) terms (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01324">Table S1</xref>): &#x201C;nutrient metabolism&#x201D; (1109, 11.4%), &#x201C;reduction/oxidation (redox) and detoxification&#x201D; (129, 1.3%), &#x201C;structure and adhesion&#x201D; (579, 5.9%), &#x201C;RNA metabolism&#x201D; (551, 5.6%), &#x201C;protein metabolism&#x201D; (1247, 12.8%), &#x201C;transport&#x201D; (1140, 11.7%), &#x201C;regulatory proteins&#x201D; (3320, 34.0%), and &#x201C;SSGPs&#x201D; (1685, 17.3%). Each category was further divided into subcategories (see below).</p>
        <p>Changes in gene expression in specific functional categories are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01324">Tables S2, and S3</xref>. Genes in each functional category exhibit a different pattern (percentages) with greater or lesser transcript abundance between samples of larvae from resistant versus susceptible plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f002">Figure 2</xref>, left panels). The category with the most differences between larvae feeding in resistant versus susceptible plants is &#x201C;RNA metabolism&#x201D;. This category had over 30% of the genes exhibiting lower transcript abundance in the sample from 0.5-, 1-, and 3-day larvae from resistant plants, compared to the corresponding samples from susceptible plants, whereas less than 5% of the genes exhibited higher transcript abundance in the corresponding samples from resistant plants. Interestingly, the percentages of genes with either greater or lesser transcript abundance in 5-day larvae from resistant versus susceptible plants were similar. Three other categories including &#x201C;protein metabolism&#x201D;, &#x201C;nutrient metabolism&#x201D;, and &#x201C;SSGPs&#x201D; had much greater percentages of genes that exhibited lesser transcript abundance in 0.5-, 1-, and 3-day larval samples from resistant plants.</p>
        <p>An opposite pattern was observed in the category &#x201C;regulatory proteins&#x201D;, in which greater percentages of genes exhibited higher transcript abundance in all samples from resistant plants compared to corresponding samples from susceptible plants. The category &#x2018;transport&#x2019; also exhibited greater percentages of genes with greater transcript abundance in all samples except for the 5-day samples from resistant versus susceptible plants, even though the differences between greater and lesser percentages were smaller. In the category &#x201C;structure and adhesion&#x201D;, there were also greater percentages of genes which exhibited greater transcript abundance in the 0.5- and 1-day larval samples from resistant plants than those from susceptible plants. However, the situation was reversed and the opposite was observed in the samples from 3- and 5-day larvae.</p>
        <p>The gene patterns with differential expression seemed to be the results of varied expression dynamics between larvae feeding in resistant versus susceptible plants. As shown in the right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the dynamics of gene expression were distinct from category to category between samples from two successive larval stages feeding in either resistant or susceptible plants.</p>

      <title>3. Discussion</title>
      <p>During the long course of co-evolution, insects and host plants have formed intimate relationships, particularly for parasitic insect species. Insect attacks on plants cause extensive changes in gene expression in host plants. Identification of the changes in gene expression in host plants after an insect attack can reveal plant defense mechanisms in response to insect infestation [<xref rid="B19-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Extensive studies have been carried out to examine differential gene expression between resistant and susceptible plants upon insect attacks through various high throughput technologies such as microarrays and RNAseq [<xref rid="B16-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In turn, plant defensive reactions to insects may cause significant changes in gene expression in insects, and therefore, identification of the insect changes in gene expression may reveal their adaptation strategies to plant defense and death mechanisms on resistant plants. So far, very little is known about genome-wide changes in gene expression between insects feeding on resistant and susceptible plants [<xref rid="B31-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>The wheat&#x2014;Hessian fly interaction results in extreme outcomes for either the infested plant or the attacking insect. During a compatible interaction, plant physiology is manipulated extensively by a Hessian fly larva, including complete inhibition of wheat growth, induction of nutritive cell formation at the feeding site, and eventual death of the plant [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Biochemically, growth-oriented metabolism in a susceptible plant is engineered to nutrient-accumulation-oriented metabolism by the Hessian fly, resulting in extensive pathway changes in the plant [<xref rid="B32-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An insect feeding in a susceptible plant, however, grows normally and changes in gene expression proceed according to a development regulatory regime. During an incompatible interaction, plants resume normal growth after some initial growth deficit following the Hessian fly attack [<xref rid="B33-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Biochemically, nutrient and energy metabolism is temporarily suppressed, whereas various plant defense pathways are activated, including the strengthening of cell walls and elevation of toxic chemicals such as reactive oxygen species, protease inhibitors, lectins, and secondary metabolites [<xref rid="B14-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, insects feeding in a resistant plant become inactive in 4&#x2013;5 days and eventually die without developing into the second instar. Significant changes should be expected in metabolism and gene expression to adapt and fight against plant defense in larvae feeding in a resistant plant. Unfortunately, genome-wide data is not yet available on larvae feeding in resistant plants.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have systematically analyzed changes in gene expression genome-wide through three-way comparisons: differences in gene expression between larvae feeding in a resistant plant versus those feeding in a susceptible plant at the same time; differences in gene expression between larvae feeding on resistant plants but at a different time; and differences in gene expression between larvae feeding in susceptible plants but at a different time. Our data revealed that overall 10%&#x2013;18% of genes exhibited either greater or lesser transcript abundance in larvae feeding in resistant plants versus those feeding in susceptible plants. The proportions of genes with greater and lesser transcript abundance is relatively balanced except in 5-day larvae, which had more genes with greater transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants. These differences were apparently caused by dynamic changes in gene expression in larvae due to feeding in either resistant or susceptible plants.</p>
      <p>When the genes were classified into different functional categories and subcategories, more genes exhibited lesser transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants, in the categories &#x201C;nutrient metabolism&#x201D;, &#x201C;RNA metabolism&#x201D;, and &#x201C;protein metabolism&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f002">Figure 2</xref>), particularly those genes involved in &#x201C;tRNA synthesis&#x201D;, &#x201C;RNA transport&#x201D;, &#x201C;protein synthesis&#x201D;, &#x201C;protein folding&#x201D;, and &#x201C;citric acid cycle and energy metabolism&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Genes in the subcategories &#x201C;tRNA synthesis&#x201D;, &#x201C;RNA transport&#x201D;, &#x201C;protein synthesis&#x201D; and &#x201C;protein folding&#x201D; participate in protein synthesis either directly or indirectly. Genes in the subcategory &#x201C;citric acid cycle and energy metabolism&#x201D; participate in the production of energy and intermediates. Lower level expression of genes involved in citric acid cycle and protein synthesis would result in lower levels of energy, metabolic intermediates, and proteins available for larval growth and development. The reduction in the available supply of energy, intermediates, and proteins probably explains why Hessian fly larvae fail to develop into second instars before dying in resistant plants.</p>
      <p>In contrast to genes involved in nutrient metabolism and protein synthesis, the number of P450 genes with greater transcript abundance was less different from the number of P450 genes with lower transcript abundance between larvae from resistant versus susceptible plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). In fact, more P450 genes had greater transcript abundance than those with reduced transcript abundance in 0.5- and 5-day larvae from resistant plants, and more P450 genes were induced when larvae developed from 1- to 3-days and from 3- to 5-day again in resistant wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the P450 genes with reduced transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants are mainly distributed in two clusters, whereas the P450 genes with greater abundance are scattered in different clusters (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01324">Figure S2</xref>). We speculate that the P450s with less transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants participate in internal physiological development processes, whereas the P450s with greater transcript abundance are likely to play important roles in counteracting host defense. P450s neutralize toxic chemicals which are either produced endogenously or ingested orally and perform a wide range of other physiological functions [<xref rid="B24-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our postulation is consistent with the fact that many P450 genes are expressed either exclusively or predominantly in Hessian fly larval midgut [<xref rid="B34-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Greater expression levels of P450 genes were also found in soybean aphids feeding on resistant soybean plants [<xref rid="B31-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to P450s, a gene encoding a functionally-related enzyme, flavin-containing monooxygenase (dimethylaniline monooxygenase, Mdes007374), showed consistently high transcript abundance from larvae feeding in resistant plants (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01324">Table S2</xref>). Flavin-dependent monooxygenases are found as a detoxification mechanism in other insect species [<xref rid="B35-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly, several genes including Mdes009489 and Mdes007220, which encode protease inhibitors, exhibited transcript abundance in insects from resistant plants (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01324">Table S2</xref>). These inhibitors could suppress wheat proteases involved in immunity to avoid host defense reactions in response to herbivore attack [<xref rid="B36-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Overall our data suggest that toxic defense play an important role in wheat resistance to Hessian fly larvae. We speculate that toxic chemicals slow down insect feeding, which gives resistant plants more time to strengthen cell walls and other host defenses, resulting in the eventual death of Hessian fly larvae due to lack of nutrients. Thus, the death of Hessian fly in resistant plants could be a combination of toxic defense and the strengthening of cell walls [<xref rid="B19-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Young Hessian fly larvae produce and likely inject a large number of SSGPs into host plants during feeding [<xref rid="B11-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. One of the objectives of this study was to identify critical candidate effector proteins that are crucial for host manipulation. Based on our data, members in families 9, 8, and 16 are likely important for Hessian fly larvae to manipulate host plants. First, many members in these families exhibited greater transcript abundance in larvae from resistant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Since Hessian fly larvae feed inside wheat plants and cannot migrate, the only choice the larvae have in response to plant defense is to secrete more critical effectors into plants in order to survive. Therefore, those putative effector genes with greater levels of expression are likely critical for plant manipulation. Second, most members in these families of SSGPs are so-called early genes, namely they were expressed most abundantly in 0.5-day larvae, and expression levels then decreased as the larvae advanced into later stages (the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01324-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Host plant manipulation is irreversible in the Hessian fly&#x2014;wheat interaction [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01324" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We hypothesize that Hessian fly larvae inject early effectors into plants for host manipulation, and then stop producing these effectors when the larvae sense that plant manipulation has been accomplished. When larvae feed in resistant plants, they fail to manipulate plants, and therefore, continue to produce these effectors over a long time. In contrast to families 9, 8, and 16, genes in families 3 and 71 exhibited different expression patterns. Most members in these two families exhibited lower transcript abundance in 1- and 3-day larvae from resistant plants, and these genes belong to so called late genes, which were expressed most abundantly in 3-day larvae from susceptible plants. We speculate that these late SSGPs are injected into host plants for other functions, and one of the possible functions for the late effectors is to protect the attacked host plants from secondary infestation or infection. Susceptible plants become physically weak after Hessian fly attack, and therefore are vulnerable to microbes in the surrounding environment. Hessian fly larvae are parasites and when plants die, insects in the plants also die. SSGP gene families are large in Hessian fly, with &gt;500 members in a family. Different family members are highly diversified and therefore could perform entirely different functions among family members. Members within the same family have exhibited different expression patterns. Therefore, further research with individual genes in different families is still needed to confirm their roles in host plant manipulation.</p>

When wheat seedlings reached the 1.5 leaf stage (stage 11 on Zadoks scales), the plants were infested with an average 0.5 Hessian fly females per plant by confining the adult flies in a screened cage. After five days, eggs hatched into neonates that migrated into wheat plants. When the first larva was found at the feeding site, the time was set at zero and larval age started from that time. Larvae were collected at day 0.5, 1, 3, and 5, by dissecting plants to expose the insects. Since larvae become inactive in resistant plants, no samples were compared beyond this stage. The dissected plants were soaked in water in a micro-centrifuge. After enough insects were collected in a tube, the water was removed and larvae frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Three independent replicates were carried out for each time point.</p>

Transcript abundance of the gene encoding a hexokinase (Mdes009091) was used as an endogenous control in qRT-PCR. This gene is expressed relatively equally in all stages according to RNA-seq data.
