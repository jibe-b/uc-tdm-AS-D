      <abstract>
        <p>The velvet protein, VeA, is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. In this study, we explored functions of FgVeA in the wheat head blight pathogen, <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>,using a gene replacement strategy. The <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant exhibited a reduction in aerial hyphae formation, hydrophobicity, and deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis. Deletion of <italic>FgVEA</italic> gene led to an increase in conidial production, but a delay in conidial germination. Pathogencity assays showed that the mutant was impaired in virulence on flowering wheat head. Sensitivity tests to various stresses exhibited that the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant showed increased resistance to osmotic stress and cell wall-damaging agents, but increased sensitivity to iprodione and fludioxonil fungicides. Ultrastructural and histochemical analyses revealed that conidia of FgVeA deletion mutant contained an unusually high number of large lipid droplets, which is in agreement with the observation that the mutant accumulated a higher basal level of glycerol than the wild-type progenitor. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in the <italic>FgVEA</italic> mutant confirmed that FgVeA was involved in various cellular processes. Additionally, six proteins interacting with FgVeA were identified by yeast two hybrid assays in current study. These results indicate that FgVeA plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> Schwabe [teleomorph <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic> (Schwein.) Petch], a homothallic ascomycete, is the major causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), which is a devastating disease of cereal crops worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Starkey1">[1]</xref>. While yield loss caused by the disease is a major concern, the mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and its derivatives, produced by the fungus in infected grains pose a serious threat to human and animal health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Sutton1">[2]</xref>. Despite the high economic impact of FHB, efficient strategies for the management of FHB are not available yet, which could be explained in part by our limited information for <italic>F. graminearum</italic> biology. Therefore, a better understanding of regulation mechanisms of fungal development, virulence, and DON biosynthesis in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> will be essential to facilitate the development of efficient control strategies against FHB.</p>
      <p>The velvet protein encoded by <italic>VEA</italic> gene has been shown to be involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including control of asexual and sexual development as well as secondary metabolisms in several fungal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Bayram1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo1">[4]</xref>. The VeA was first characterized in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> as an inhibitor of light-dependent conidiation in 1960 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Kfer1">[5]</xref>, and was later shown to be a negative regulator of asexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Yager1">[6]</xref>. A <italic>VEA</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> failed to form fruiting bodies, and the opposite effect was observed when the gene was over-expressed, which confirmed that VeA is a positive regulator of sexual development and simultaneously a negative regulator of asexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Kim1">[7]</xref>. It is interesting that in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>, genetically related to <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, deletion of <italic>VEA</italic> resulted to a reduction of conidiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo2">[8]</xref>. These results indicate that the role of VeA in sexual development varies significantly among different fungal species.</p>
      <p>In last few years, effects of VeA on secondary metabolism have been well investigated in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, VeA is necessary for expression of the transcription factor <italic>AflR</italic>, which activates the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin biosynthesis gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Lee1">[9]</xref>. Similarly, in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> and <italic>A. flavus</italic>, VeA is essential for the expression of two transcription factors <italic>AflR</italic> and <italic>AflJ</italic>, which are necessary for activation of aflatoxin biosynthesis genes. Consequently, the mycotoxin aflatoxin biosynthesis is completely blocked in <italic>VEA</italic> deletion mutants of these fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Meyers1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Du1">[11]</xref>. In addition to its multiple functions in secondary metabolism and fungal development, recent evidence showed that VeA negatively regulated catabolism of branched chain amino acid and ethanol metabolism at the transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Roze1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>VeA proteins are conserved throughout the fungal kingdom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>. Recently, functions of VeA have been investigated in several other filamentous fungi including <italic>Acremonium chrysogenum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Dreyer1">[14]</xref>, <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Myung1">[15]</xref>, <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Choi1">[16]</xref> and <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Hoff1">[17]</xref>. In these fungal species, <italic>VEA</italic> deletion mutants present some new phenotypic characteristics, which were not described in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. For example, deletion of <italic>VEA</italic> gene (<italic>FvVE1</italic>) in <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> suppressed aerial hyphal growth and reduced colony surface hydrophobicity on solid media. In addition, deletion of <italic>FvVE1</italic> markedly increased the ratio of macroconidia to microconidia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>. The <italic>VEA</italic> deletion mutants of <italic>M. graminicola</italic> were hypersensitive to shaking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Choi1">[16]</xref>. In <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, FfVel1 (a homolog of VeA of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp.) can act as a positive regulator for biosyntheses of gibberellins, fumonisins and fusarin CA, simultaneously as a negative regulator for another secondary metabolite bikaverin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Wiemann1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>FfVel1</italic> deletion mutants failed to infect rice seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Wiemann1">[18]</xref>. In contrast, pathogenicity was not altered in the <italic>VEA</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>M. graminicola</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Choi1">[16]</xref>. These studies indicate that functions of VeA in different fungal species may vary significantly.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate functions of <italic>FgVEA</italic> gene encoding a VeA-homologous protein in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Although the role of VeA in controlling synthesis of secondary metabolites is a common feature, notably, in current study, we observed that the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutants of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> presented some new phenotypic characteristics, which were not previously described in other fungi.</p>

        <p>The <italic>FgVEA</italic> (<italic>F. graminearum</italic> genome accession number FGSG_11955.3) was originally identified through homology searches of the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> genome sequence by using BLASTP algorithm with the FvVe1 of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref> as query. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic> genome database, FGSG_11955.3 missed a 225-bp fragment. After sequenced the full length genomic DNA and cDNA sequence for <italic>FgVEA</italic>, we found that the gene including one intron is 1,656-bp in length, and encodes a 532-amino-acid protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of FgVeA shares 79%, 78%, 52%, and 47% identities to FfVel1 of <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, FvVe1 of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, VeA of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, and PcVelA of <italic>P. chrysogenum</italic>, respectively. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences showed that N-terminal regions of VeA from different fungi including <italic>F. graminearum</italic> are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Further <italic>in silico</italic> analyses demonstrated that FgVeA has a putative pat4 nuclear localization signal (NLS) from amino acids 474 to 477.</p>

        <title>Deletion of FgVEA in F. graminearum</title>
        <p>To investigate functions of the velvet protein FgVeA in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, we generated gene deletion mutants using a homology recombination strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Among thirteen hygromycin-resistant transformants, eight <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutants were identified by PCR analysis with the primer pair A5 + A6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s006">Table S1</xref>). The primer pair amplified 1,759- and 1,537-bp fragments from <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutants and the wild-type progenitor PH-1, respectively. When probed with a 1,162-bp DNA fragment of <italic>FgVEA</italic>, the deletion mutant &#x394;FgVeA-9 had an anticipated 3,213-bp band, but lacked a 4,912-bp band which was present in the progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The Southern hybridization pattern confirmed that the &#x394;FgVeA-9 is a null mutant resulting from a single homologous recombination event at the <italic>FgVEA</italic> locus. The complemented strain &#x394;FgVeA-9C contains a single copy of wild-type <italic>FgVEA</italic>, which was inserted into genome of the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant &#x394;FgVeA-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effects of FgVeA on hyphal growth and pigment formation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic></title>
        <p>The deletion of <italic>FgVEA</italic> dramatically affected colony morphology of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> on solid media. The mycelial growth rate of &#x394;FgVeA-9 was significantly slower than that of wild type progenitor PH-1 and the complemented strain &#x394;FgVeA-9C on MM medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, the &#x394;FgVeA-9 exhibited reduced aerial hyphal growth on solid media PDA, CM and MM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), although scanning electron microscopy examination showed that the hyphae of &#x394;FgVeA-9 were not significantly different from those of wild type progenitor (data not shown). The phenotypic defects of &#x394;FgVeA-9 mutant on solid media were restored by genetic complementation with the wild-type <italic>FgVEA</italic> in the complemented strain &#x394;FgVeA-9C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

        <p>The hydrophobic property on the cell surface is a distinguishable feature of aerial hyphae and contributes to hyphal formation in many fungal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Kershaw1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Wsten1">[20]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>FgVEA</italic> led to inhibition of aerial hyphae gorwth, which suggested a reduction of hydrophobicity on cell surface of the mutant. To confirm this deduction, 20 &#xB5;l of water was placed on the colony surface of each strain grown on the solid medium PDA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, the water formed spherical droplets on the colony of wild-type progenitor without extending or being absorbed for at least 30 min. In contrast, the water was absorbed into the mycelia of &#x394;FgVeA-9 within 10 sec. The absorption difference was easily visualized when 2.5% bromophenol blue water solution was placed on the colony surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results indicate that FgVeA is important for colony surface properties in <italic>F. graminearum.</italic></p>
        <p>On CM medium, it was clear that &#x394;FgVeA-9 revealed a significant reduction in red pigment formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

        <title>Effects of FgVeA on conidial differentiation and germination</title>
        <p>The VeA had been found to regulate asexual development in several other fungal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo1">[4]</xref>. Consequently, we examined the conidiation, conidial germination, and cellar structure for the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant &#x394;FgVeA-9. In MBL medium, &#x394;FgVeA-9 produced significantly more conidia than the wild type progenitor or the complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). When cultured the conidia in 2% glucose, only approximately 20% conidia of &#x394;FgVeA-9 were able to germinate within 6 hr of incubation, but almost all conidia of wild type progenitor or the complemented strain germinated under the same condition. When incubation time was extended to 12 h, all the conidia of &#x394;FgVeA-9 were able to germinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), and form normal unbranched germ tubes, indicating that deletion of <italic>FgVEA</italic> led to a delay in conidial germination. Scanning electron microscopic examination showed that conidia of &#x394;FgVeA-9 were slightly slender than those of wild type PH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). In order to characterize the conidia of &#x394;FgVeA-9 in detail, we examined conidial structure using transmission electron microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, a few large lipid droplets were observed in &#x394;FgVeA-9 conidia, but not in those of wild type strain. The lipid droplets were further verified by histochemical staining with Nile Red. The large discrete lipid droplets were highlighted in the ungerminated and germinating conidia of &#x394;FgVeA-9, but not in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The large discrete lipid droplets were degraded in the hyphae of &#x394;FgVeA-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In the following serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) experiment, we also paid attention on the expression of the genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s007">Table S2</xref>, among 41 genes, 25 and 1 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were up- and down-regulated, respectively, more than five folds.

Surprisingly, yeast two-hybrid assay showed that FgVeA did not interact with FgVelB or FgLaeA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g012">Fig. 12</xref>). Using yeast two-hybrid approach, we did identify six FgVeA interacting proteins (designed FgVIPs), that are homologous to FgLaeA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028291-g012">Fig. 12</xref>).

It was surprised that except for a slight change in pigment formation, the deletion mutants of these six genes were indistinguishable from the wild type progenitor on PDA plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), and all mutants were pathogenic on wheat head (data not show).

      <p>Recent studies in several filamentous fungi have shown that the VeA protein plays an important role in fungal growth, colony morphology, development, and secondary metabolism. However, certain variations in the role have been observed in different fungi even within the genus of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo1">[4]</xref>. For example, complementation of the <italic>A. nidulans VEA</italic> deletion mutant with the velvet gene from <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> could not rescue the wild-type phenotypes of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, indicating species-specific functions of VeA in different fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo1">[4]</xref>. Bioinformatic analyses have demonstrated that fungal VeA proteins consist of conserved N-terminal and variable C-terminal regions, which may be responsible for conserved and species-specific functions of VeA, respectively. Consistent with conserved N-terminal as well as variable C-terminal functions of the velvet proteins, in this study, we found some of the phenotypes in <italic>FgVEA</italic> mutant were similar to those reported in other fungi, while others were novel and unique to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>The first study of VeA ortholog in other fungal species beyond the genus <italic>Aspergillus</italic> was conducted by Li <italic>et al.</italic> for the plant pathogen <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>. In <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, conidia of <italic>FvVE1</italic> deletion mutant exhibited three unnormal types of germination: hyperbranched hyphae, microcycle conidiation and yeast-like growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>. Different from <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, in current study, we found that deletion of <italic>F. graminearum FgVEA</italic> led to a delay in conidial germination, but conidia of <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant germinated to form normal unbranched germ tubes. In <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, deletion of <italic>FvVE1</italic> caused a notable activation of conidiation and increased the ratio of macroconida to microconidia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>. In this study, we also observed that the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> produced significant more conidia than wild type progenitor. In contrast, deletion of <italic>FfVel1</italic> in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> led to a significant reduction in conidiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Wiemann1">[18]</xref>. The opposite effect of VeA on conidiation had also been found in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>A. flavus</italic>, deletion of <italic>VEA</italic> resulted in an increase in asexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Yager1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Duran1">[31]</xref>. However, conidiation was reduced when <italic>VEA</italic> was deleted in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>, a species genetically related to <italic>A. flavus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo2">[8]</xref>. These results strongly indicated that the roles of VeA in conidiation and conidial germination vary significantly in different fungal species.</p>
      <p>A previous study of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> showed that deletion of the <italic>FvVE1</italic> gene resulted in decreased hydrophobicity of the colony surface and impairment in aerial hyphae formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Li1">[13]</xref>. Similarly, we observed a significant reduction of aerial hyphal growth and hydrophobicity in <italic>FgVEA</italic> mutant compared to the wild-type progenitor PH-1. The reduced hydrophobicity on cell surface in <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant suggested an alteration in cell wall composition. We therefore tested sensitivity of the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant to cell wall damaging agents, congo red and caffeine. As expectedly, the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant showed resistant to cellulose-binging chemical congo red and to caffeine, which is in agreement with the overexpression of 1,3-beta-glucan synthase gene, <italic>FgGLS2</italic> (FGSG_07946) in the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s007">Table S2</xref>). These results indicated that FgVeA had an important role in maintaining normal cell wall composition and integrity.</p>
      <p>Secondary metabolism had been reported to be positively regulated by velvet proteins in several fungi. <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, a pathogen of important cereal crops, produces various secondary metabolites including the trichothecene mycotoxin, DON <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Kimura1">[32]</xref>. In this study, we observed that FgVeA positively regulated expression of DON biosynthesis genes and DON production. Similar to DON production, the <italic>FvVE1</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> produced significantly less gibberellin than the wild type strain did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Wiemann1">[18]</xref>. The dramatic down regulation of secondary metabolites in <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. was consistent with the observation from <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., where VeA had been found to activate production of mycotoxin sterigmatosystin in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Kato1">[33]</xref>, aflatoxin and cyclopiazonic acid in <italic>A. flavus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Duran1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Amaike1">[34]</xref> as well as aflatoxin in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Calvo2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A previous study showed that the <italic>FvVE1</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> produced more red pigment (polyketide bikaverin) than the wild type strain. In contrast, the <italic>FvVE1</italic> overexpression mutant showed significantly less coloration. Consistently with these observations, expressions of bikaverin cluster genes were significantly up-regulated in the <italic>FvVEl</italic> deletion mutant and down-regulated in the overexpression mutant. <italic>F. graminearum</italic> also produced a red pigment, the polyketide aurofusarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Medentsev1">[35]</xref>. In contrast to the bikaverin biosynthesis in <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, in current study, we found that the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant produced dramatically less red pigment on solid media. Furthermore, expressions of seven aurofusarin biosynthesis genes were down-regulated significantly in the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s007">Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that the role of VeA in the regulation of pigment biosynthesis is species-dependent.</p>
      <p>In response to osmotic pressure, fungi usually accumulated glycerol within their cells via HOG pathway to increase the internal turgor pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Rispail1">[36]</xref>. In current study, we found that the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion showed increased tolerance to osmotic stress mediated by NaCl and KCl. This finding was in agreement with the observation that the mutant accumulated a higher level of glycerol than the wild-type progenitor. These results suggest that FgVeA was associated with the HOG pathway in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>In this study, phenotypic characterization of the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant showed that FgVeA was essential for virulence of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The impairment in virulence of <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant appeared to be due to defects in multiple regulatory functions. First, the deletion of <italic>FgVEA</italic> led to a delay in conidial germination and retardation in mycelium growth. Second, the <italic>FgVEA</italic> mutant produced a dramatically low level of DON, which played a significant role in spread of the fungus within a spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Bai1">[37]</xref>. In addition, it had been demonstrated that the hydrophobic property on the cell surface and normal fungal cell wall were important for viability, fungal morphology, and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Kershaw1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Muller1">[38]</xref>, the reduced hydrophobicity of cell surface in <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant may partially lead to impairment in virulence of the mutant on wheat head. The involvement of VeA protein in virulence had also been reported in <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Wiemann1">[18]</xref>, but not in <italic>M. graminicola</italic>. The F<italic>fVel1</italic> mutant of <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> was nonpathogenic on rice seedlings; but in <italic>M. graminicola</italic>, the <italic>VEA</italic> deletion mutant remained high virulence on wheat leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Choi1">[16]</xref>. These results indicated that the roles of VeA in pathogenicity vary significantly in different fungi.</p>
      <p>In this study, we observed that conidia of &#x394;FgVeA contained more lipid droplets than the wild-type progenitor. SAGE data also showed that an increased number of genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism were up-regulated significantly in the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s007">Table S2</xref>). To our knowledge, it was the first report that VeA was involved in lipid metabolism in fungi. Interestingly, previous analysis in our laboratory revealed that the deletion of a type 2C protein phosphatase gene <italic>FgPTC3</italic> also led to accumulation of large lipid droplets in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028291-Jiang2">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, several phenotypes of the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant, including reduction in aerial hyphal formation and DON biosynthesis, resistance to cell wall damaging agents, and impairment in pathogenicity, were similar to those of the <italic>FgPTC3</italic> deletion mutant. These results indicated that FgPtc3 and FgVeA had some common functions in regulation of various cellular processes. This inference was further supported by SAGE analyses of gene expression profiling in <italic>FgPTC3</italic> and <italic>FgVEA</italic> mutants. Among 1215 up-regulated genes in the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant, 721 genes (59.3%) were also up-regulated in the <italic>FgPTC3</italic> deletion mutant. Again 354 down-regulated genes in the <italic>FgVEA</italic> deletion mutant, 218 genes (61.6%) were also down-regulated in the <italic>FgPTC3</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028291.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). The significant overlap in genes regulated by FgVeA and FgPtc3 strongly indicated that both components were involved in some common signaling pathways in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Thus, it will be interesting to investigate relationships between these two components and their downstream network in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, which would be helpful in understanding biology of <italic>F. graminearum.</italic></p>

The experiment was repeated three times independently, and data were analyzed using analysis of variance (SAS version 8.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>
        <p>To determine expression level of <italic>TIR5</italic> and <italic>TRI6</italic>, the mycelia of the wild-type progenitor PH-1, and the &#x394;FgVeA-9 were inoculated into GYEP medium (5% glucose, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% peptone) and cultured for 2 days at 25&#xB0;C in the dark. Total RNA was extracted from mycelia of each sample, the expression of <italic>TRI5</italic> and <italic>TRI6</italic> were determined using a quantitative real-time PCR method. The experiment was repeated three times.</p>
