          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine caused by an immunologic hypersensitivity reaction to dietary wheat gluten.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Objectives</title>
          <p>We sought to clone, express, and perform IgA epitope mapping of a CD-specific wheat antigen and to study its usefulness for identifying patients with CD and monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>A synthetic gene coding for &#x3B3;-gliadin 1 (GG1) was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Recombinant &#x3B3;-gliadin 1 (rGG1) was purified and characterized biochemically, structurally, and immunologically by using sera from patients with CD and control subjects. Overlapping GG1 peptides were synthesized for IgA and IgG epitope mapping. GG1 and peptide-specific antibodies were raised for tracing GG1 in cereals and dietary wheat products and to study its resistance to digestion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>rGG1 was expressed and purified. rGG1-based IgA ELISAs performed in populations of patients with CD and control subjects showed a specificity of 92.9%, which was higher than that of gliadin extract (e). Furthermore, it allowed monitoring of adherence to a gluten-free diet in patients. A&#xA0;26-amino-acid peptide from the proline-glutamine&#x2013;rich repetitive N-terminal region was identified as the immunodominant IgA epitope. GG1-related antigens were found in rye, barley, and spelt but not in oat, rice, or maize. GG1 was detected in dietary wheat products after baking, and in particular, the major IgA epitope&#x2013;containing region was resistant against digestion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>rGG1 and its epitope might be useful for identifying patients with CD, monitoring treatment, and studying the pathomechanisms of CD and development of preventive and therapeutic strategies.</p>

    <p>Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine caused by a hypersensitive immune response to dietary gluten proteins that affects 0.7% to 2% of the European and American population.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> CD is characterized by small intestinal villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and infiltration of gliadin-specific lymphocytes in the lamina propria.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> On gluten exposure, patients usually secrete high titers of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAs) and antibodies against endomysial proteins (EMA) proteins.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) was identified as one of the endomysial autoantigens.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Interestingly, deamidation of gliadin peptides by tTG2 enhances activation and IFN-&#x3B3; secretion by gliadin-specific T cells, which is thought to lead to mucosal damage.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Assays measuring levels of anti-tTG2 and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies are being used for the diagnosis of CD. Although these tests are very useful for diagnosis, they are not ideally suited for the monitoring of a patient's adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD).<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Measurement of AGA levels for diagnosis is less frequently performed because of their lower specificity and sensitivity.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
    <p>In fact, AGA tests are based on an alcohol-soluble fraction of wheat, termed the gliadin fraction, which is a complex mixture of water-insoluble seed storage proteins. Within the gliadin fraction, many proteins can be found, among them cysteine-rich &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;-gliadins, &#x3B3;-gliadins, and cysteine-poor &#x3C9;-gliadins, which occur in numerous isoforms and heterogeneities, all of which might not be equally toxic to patients with CD.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
    <p>We have recently developed a subfractionation technique for the gliadin fraction to enrich highly CD-specific IgA-reactive antigens. Analysis of the subfractions for IgA reactivity with sera from patients with CD and control subjects revealed that the subfraction containing &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;-gliadins had lower specificity than a subfraction that was rich in &#x3B3;-gliadins. Within this CD-specific IgA-reactive fraction, we identified peptide sequences derived from &#x3B3;-gliadins as possible CD-specific IgA-reactive wheat antigens based on mass spectrometry and protein sequencing.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
    <p>The aim of this study was the molecular characterization, cloning, and epitope mapping of a CD-specific wheat antigen. We also sought to study its usefulness for identifying patients with CD and monitoring adherence to a GFD. Based on the previously obtained &#x3B3;-gliadin peptide sequences, we have now constructed a synthetic gene coding for a &#x3B3;-gliadin, which we designated &#x3B3;-gliadin 1 (GG1), expressed the recombinant protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, purified it to homogeneity and performed a biochemical and structural analysis of the recombinant protein. The recombinant protein was then evaluated for specific IgA reactivity with sera from patients with CD and various control populations. Furthermore, we studied the usefulness of IgA anti&#x2013;recombinant &#x3B3;-gliadin 1 (rGG1) antibodies for monitoring adherence to GFD. IgA epitopes were mapped by testing a series of overlapping synthetic peptides. Rabbit antisera were raised against the recombinant protein and its major IgA-reactive peptide to identify related antigens in other cereals and to investigate its resistance to baking and digestion.</p>

        <title>Identification of GG1 based on amino acid sequence data, cloning, and expression of rGG1</title>
        <p>Using a combined biochemical and immunologic approach, we have identified a subfraction of wheat gliadin that reacted specifically to IgA antibodies from patients with CD.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Within this subfraction, 2 peptide sequences (ie, N-terminus: NIQVDPSGQ; internal peptide, APFASIVAGIGGQ) belonging to &#x3B3;-gliadins were obtained from the approximately 35-kDa protein band. When we searched the SwissProt database for wheat sequences coding for proteins of the corresponding molecular weight containing both peptides, we identified GG1 from <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (SwissProt accession no. P08453.1) as a candidate antigen. A&#xA0;National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Protein blast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" id="intref0010">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) of the amino acid sequence of GG1 with sequences from <italic>T aestivum</italic> (taxid:4565) deposited in the NCBI nonredundant protein sequences (nr) database yielded 25 &#x3B3;-gliadin isoforms of similar molecular weights containing both peptides, which differed only in a few amino acids.</p>
        <p>A synthetic gene containing the sequence coding for the mature protein of the GG1 gene (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-n:M16064" id="intref0015">M16064</ext-link>, SwissProt ID: P08453.1) along with a C-terminal 6x Histidine tag and methionine as a start codon, which was codon optimized for expression in <italic>E coli</italic>, was obtained from GenScript (Piscataway Township, NJ) and cloned into pET-27b(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany).</p>
        <p>The pET-GG1 construct was transformed into <italic>E coli</italic> BL21 (DE3; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), and rGG1 was expressed in liquid cultures and purified, as previously described.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>

        <p>The rGG1 protein was dialyzed in 40 mmol/L acetic acid, and the circular dichroism spectra of rGG1 were analyzed by using a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The far-UV circular dichroism spectra from 190 to 260 nm were recorded in a 2-mm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma, Mullheim, Baden, Germany) with a resolution of 1 nm, a scan speed of 50 nm/min, and a protein concentration of 0.10 mg/mL, and an average of 3 scans were obtained.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We cloned, expressed, and purified rGG1, which was specifically recognized by IgA antibodies from 73.01% of patients with CD, demonstrating that it is a major IgA-reactive wheat antigen. In pilot tests sensitivity of the rGG1-based IgA testing was lower when compared with gliadin extract (e)&#x2013;based testing, but by using rGG1, a higher specificity of 92.9% was obtained. This specificity was higher when compared with that of native gliadin extract (e), which had a specificity of only 75.8%. Thus our results indicate that rGG1 is a major CD-specific antigen.</p>
      <p>Because the only treatment option available for patients with CD is to be on a lifelong GFD, monitoring the patient's adherence to this diet is important. Although in our pilot study we could test only a limited number of patients before and after a GFD and a second set of sera after a GFD, our results suggest that IgA reactivity to rGG1 might be better suited for monitoring GFD adherence when compared with measuring antibody levels against tTG2 or DGP. Thus IgA reactivity to rGG1 can be used as a marker for monitoring GFD adherence in patients with CD.</p>
      <p>We next determined the IgA epitopes of GG1 using a set of synthetic overlapping peptides spanning the GG1 sequence. IgA antibodies from patients with CD identified mainly peptides (ie, peptides 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) in the proline- and glutamine-rich repetitive region at the N-terminus, of which one peptide (ie, peptide 4) was most strongly and frequently recognized. Interestingly, IgG antibodies, although to a weaker extent, were directed against these peptides, indicating a coevolution of the antibody response in the IgA and IgG class in patients with CD. Of note, the sequence motif QPQQPF, which has previously been identified by means of random phage cloning with sera from patients with CD, occurs in peptides 4, 5, 6, and 7, and a similar motif (QPQQPQ) can be found in peptide 9.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Our assumption that GG1 could be an important CD-specific antigen is also supported by the fact that it contains a T-cell epitope, which has been previously mapped with a T-cell clone that was isolated from the gut of a patient with CD.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This T-cell epitope overlaps with the IgA-reactive peptide 9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The sequence alignment of GG1 with the corresponding prolamins from other cereals showed that the formerly described T-cell epitope is well conserved only in spelt but not in rye and barley, which might explain the selective T-cell recognition reported earlier.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> By contrast, the rabbit anti-rGG1 antibodies showed cross-reactivity with those cereals (ie, rye, barley, and spelt) that are also not well tolerated by patients with CD, whereas little or no reactivity was observed with oat, rice, and maize, which can be part of the diet of patients with CD.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> These data suggest that it might be possible to use the rabbit anti-rGG1 antibodies for screening of various types of processed food to detect GG1- and GG1-related proteins and for subsequent food labeling. This assumption is further supported by the finding that anti-rGG1 antibodies detected GG1 strongly in various breads, whereas only weak signals were obtained with gluten-free bread. Using anti-rGG1 antibodies, we also could demonstrate that GG1 is resistant to baking. This finding might explain why it can serve as a major CD antigen in baked and processed foods. Perhaps even more important was the finding that rGG1 was resistant to pepsin and partly to chymotrypsin digestion because peptide fragments reactive to anti-rGG1 were still detected after full pepsin digestion and a subsequent 4 hours of chymotrypsin digestion. Interestingly, the major IgA-reactive region of rGG1 was particularly resistant because fragments reactive to the anti&#x2013;peptide 4 antibodies but not to anti&#x2013;peptide 18 antibodies were observed after peptic digestion.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have cloned and expressed a major CD-specific wheat antigen. Based on the GG1 sequence and epitope mapping, it might be possible to develop new forms of prevention and treatment for CD.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Clinical implications</title></caption><p>rGG1 and a synthetic peptide containing a major IgA-reactive epitope thereof can be used as markers for CD.</p></boxed-text></p>
