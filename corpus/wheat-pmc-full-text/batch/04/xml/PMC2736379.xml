      <abstract>
        <p>The necrotrophic fungus <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> produces multiple proteinaceous host-selective toxins (HSTs) which act in effector triggered susceptibility. Here, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of the SnTox3-encoding gene, designated <italic>SnTox3</italic>, as well as the initial characterization of the SnTox3 protein. <italic>SnTox3</italic> is a 693 bp intron-free gene with little obvious homology to other known genes. The predicted immature SnTox3 protein is 25.8 kDa in size. A 20 amino acid signal sequence as well as a possible pro sequence are predicted. Six cysteine residues are predicted to form disulfide bonds and are shown to be important for SnTox3 activity. Using heterologous expression in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and transformation into an avirulent <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate, we show that <italic>SnTox3</italic> encodes the SnTox3 protein and that <italic>SnTox3</italic> interacts with the wheat susceptibility gene <italic>Snn3</italic>. In addition, the avirulent <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate transformed with <italic>SnTox3</italic> was virulent on host lines expressing the <italic>Snn3</italic> gene. <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted mutants were deficient in the production of SnTox3 and avirulent on the <italic>Snn3</italic> differential wheat line BG220. An analysis of genetic diversity revealed that <italic>SnTox3</italic> is present in 60.1% of a worldwide collection of 923 isolates and occurs as eleven nucleotide haplotypes resulting in four amino acid haplotypes. The cloning of <italic>SnTox3</italic> provides a fundamental tool for the investigation of the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>&#x2013;wheat interaction, as well as vital information for the general characterization of necrotroph&#x2013;plant interactions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The necrotrophic fungus <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> produces multiple toxins that are effective in causing disease on wheat. Here, we report the characterization of the SnTox3-producing gene, designated <italic>SnTox3</italic>, as well as the initial characterization of the SnTox3 protein. In order to verify the action of this toxin, we expressed <italic>SnTox3</italic> in yeast to show that <italic>SnTox3</italic> encodes the SnTox3 protein which interacts directly or indirectly with the product of the corresponding wheat susceptibility gene <italic>Snn3</italic>. Transformation of a non pathogenic <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate with <italic>SnTox3</italic> indicated that expression of the SnTox3 gene is sufficient to render an avirulent isolate virulent in the presence of <italic>Snn3</italic>. <italic>SnTox3</italic> disruption mutants are deficient in the production of SnTox3 and consequently are avirulent on the <italic>Snn3</italic> differential wheat line BG220. <italic>SnTox3</italic> is present in approximately 60% of a worldwide collection of 923 isolates. The cloning of <italic>SnTox3</italic> provides a critical tool for the investigation of the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>&#x2013;wheat interaction, but also significantly adds to a necrotrophic effector system that is an exciting contrast to the biotrophic effector models that have been intensively studied.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Diseases caused by necrotrophic pathogens are believed to be distinctly different from those caused by biotrophs where the pathogen requires a living host to grow and sporulate. The interaction between biotrophic pathogens and their hosts is controlled via the interaction of pathogen effector molecules which, if recognized by the corresponding resistance gene product, results in localized programmed cell death (PCD) and activation of plant defense which leads to a resistant or incompatible interaction. This interaction has been referred to as effector triggered immunity (ETI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Chisholm1">[1]</xref>. In contrast, necrotrophic pathogens induce host cell death during infection. Host-selective toxins (HSTs) are molecules produced by some necrotrophic fungi that induce a necrotic reaction and promote a susceptible/compatible interaction in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Wolpert1">[2]</xref>. Most HSTs are small secondary metabolites and their production is under the control of complex genetic and enzymatic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Panaccione1">[3]</xref>. But several proteinaceous HSTs have been identified more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Ciuffetti1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Sarpeleh1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic>, the causal agent of Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), is a necrotrophic fungus that causes major yield losses worldwide by infecting the leaves and glumes of wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Eyal1">[9]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Hane1">[11]</xref>. SNB resistance is quantitatively inherited with little obvious evidence of an isolate-specific relationship between the pathogen and the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Eyal2">[12]</xref>. Early research on SNB indicated that resistance was mostly controlled by multiple genes located on chromosomes throughout the genome, with each showing minor association with disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Xu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We recently identified four proteinaceous HSTs from <italic>S. nodorum</italic> and showed they play an important role in disease development by interacting with corresponding host sensitivity/susceptibility gene products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen1">[14]</xref>. One of these HSTs, ToxA, is a small proteinaceous HST produced by approximately 40% of <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolates worldwide and is present in multiple forms in <italic>S. nodorum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen2">[15]</xref>. ToxA interacts with the product of the wheat gene <italic>Tsn1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Faris1">[16]</xref> and fungal strains carrying <italic>ToxA</italic> are significantly more virulent on wheat lines carrying <italic>Tsn1</italic>. <italic>ToxA</italic> is also expressed by the tan spot pathogen <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Ciuffetti1">[4]</xref> and induces necrosis in a process which involves uptake into the host cytoplasm, translocation to the chloroplast and disruption of photosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Manning1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>SnTox1 and SnTox2 also appear to be small proteins, though their encoding genes have not yet been cloned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Liu1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen3">[19]</xref>. Preparations of SnTox1 and SnTox2 induce necrosis on wheat lines carrying the toxin sensitivity genes <italic>Snn1</italic> and <italic>Snn2</italic>, and fungal isolates producing these toxins are more virulent on wheat lines carrying <italic>Snn1</italic> and <italic>Snn2</italic>, respectively. The presence of these toxins also varies between isolates and the strain Sn79-1087 appears to produce no toxins at all and is avirulent on all tested wheat lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen2">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously characterized the reaction of a necrosis-inducing activity that defines a fourth host locus called <italic>Snn3</italic>. Culture filtrate fractions of <italic>S. nodorum</italic> strain Sn1501 were used to define a QTL on chromosome 5BS in a cross between wheat lines BR34 and Grandin. SnTox3 is proteinaceous and was reported to be 10&#x2013;30 kDa in size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref>. QTL analysis showed that the SnTox3-<italic>Snn3</italic> interaction contributed significantly to disease development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we report the molecular cloning of the SnTox3-encoding gene <italic>SnTox3</italic>, and show that SnTox3 plays an important role in disease by interacting directly or indirectly with the product of the wheat sensitivity gene <italic>Snn3</italic>. The cloning of <italic>SnTox3</italic> provides a critical tool for the molecular and biochemical characterization of the host-pathogen interaction in the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat pathosystem.</p>

        <title>Identification of the SnTox3-encoding gene</title>
        <p>Progeny line BG220 from the BR34 x Grandin recombinant inbred population was previously identified as a SnTox3 differential line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref> and was used in identifying and characterizing this toxin. Ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography was used for the initial purification of BG220-reactive material as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref>. A large peak and three smaller peaks were observed in size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000581.s003">Figure S1</xref>); the large peak was associated with SnTox3 activity and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The protein gel was visualized as containing a light band and a dark band within the size range of 6.5 to 32.0 kDa. The light band was estimated at 18.0 kDa and the darker band was estimated at 13.0 kDa. Mass spectra obtained from the two bands was used to search the <italic>S. nodorum</italic> protein database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Hane1">[11]</xref> leading to the identification of two predicted proteins, SNOG_08981 and SNOG_16063, corresponding to the light and dark protein bands in the gel, respectively.</p>

        <p>PCR amplification revealed that <italic>SNOG_16063</italic> was present in all strains tested whereas <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> was absent in the avirulent isolate Sn79-1087 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000581.s004">Figure S2</xref>). Since Sn79-1087 did not produce BG220-reactive material, this indicated that <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> could correspond to the SnTox3 encoding gene. Further analysis of the MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and MS/MS spectra of the trypsinized peptides identified a total of 44% of the predicted immature SNOG_08981 protein sequence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000581.s005">Figure S3</xref> for mascot search results of SNOG_08981).

Below: A close up of a 1.6 kb genomic region (dash boxed) indicates a single exon, the 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;- UTR, and the putative promoter region. B. Nucleotide sequence of a 1.6 kb genomic region of <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> (<italic>SnTox3</italic>) and the deduced amino acid sequence of the SNOG_08981 protein (SnTox3). The underlined peptide sequence was detected in mass spectrometry. The amino acids highlighted in blue indicate the predicted signal peptide. The six cysteine residues highlighted in green are predicted to form 3 disulfide bonds. The bold DNA sequence indicates the start codon (ATG), stop codon (TAG) and the <italic>Sal</italic>I restriction site. DNA sequence highlighted in yellow is UTR and the red highlighted region is a putative TATA box. Bold italicized sequence indicates the primer sites used to amplify the genomic region for transformation.</p>

        <p>The full-length cDNA of the <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> gene was identified by reverse-transcription and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The gene comprises an 80 bp 5&#x2032; UTR, a 146 bp 3&#x2032; UTR and a single exon of 693-nucleotides encoding a protein with 230 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). A putative TATA box was located 95 bp upstream of the start codon whereas no obvious CAAT box was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>SNOG_8981</italic> cDNA sequence identified was different from that found in the genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/stagonospora_nodorum">http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/stagonospora_nodorum</ext-link>). The genome sequence archives at this region were retrieved to perform re-assembly and the difference was shown to be due to an error in the sequence assembly. The reassembled sequence fully matched our cDNA sequence. The corrected <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> sequence was submitted to NCBI as Genbank accession number FJ823644.</p>
        <p>Using the <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> ORF sequence in BLASTN or BLASTX searches of the NCBI nr database, no significant similarity to sequences from other organisms was detected. The <italic>S. nodorum</italic> hypothetical protein, SNOG_10812, was the only hit in a BLASTX search with a score at 67.0 bits and an E-value at 1e-09.

        <p>Culture filtrate of <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate Sn79-1087, which was isolated from a wild grass, produces no necrosis on any wheat line we have studied. Furthermore it is completely avirulent to all wheat lines that have been tested.

            <p>A. Verification of the <italic>SnTox3</italic> transformation into Sn79-1087 and disruption in Sn1501 using Southern analysis. Genomic DNA from the avirulent isolate Sn79-1087 and its two <italic>SnTox3</italic> transformed strains Sn79+SnTox3A and Sn79+SnTox3B were digested with <italic>Xho</italic>I. The virulent <italic>SnTox3</italic> containing isolate Sn1501 and its two <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A and Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B as well as a strain with an ectopic integration, Sn1501Ect, were digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI. The blot was probed with a full length <italic>SnTox3</italic> cDNA. The two red dots indicate the bands of 7.5 kb and 3.0 kb specifically present in the <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). A 7.9 kb band is present in the wild type and ectopic strain. More ectopic insertions were detected by southern in Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A and Sn1501Ect, compared to Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B. B. <italic>SnTox3</italic> disruption strategy in Sn1501. The <italic>SnTox3</italic> gene in Sn1501 was disrupted by insertion of the hygromycin B resistance gene (orange bar) into a <italic>Sal</italic>I restriction site located in the center of the <italic>SnTox3</italic> gene. A &#x223C;1.2 kb genomic region of <italic>SnTox3</italic> (black bar) amplified with primers 8981g1F_XbaI and 8981g1R_XbaI was cloned and then linearized with <italic>Sal</italic>I. The linearized vector was re-ligated with a <italic>cpc-1</italic>:<italic>HYG</italic> :<italic>tryptophan c</italic> cassette that was released from the pLP605KO vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Panaccione2">[51]</xref> using the restriction enzyme <italic>Xho</italic>I. The resulting vector was linearized via <italic>Xba</italic>I before transformation into Sn1501 protoplasts. The disruption of <italic>SnTox3</italic> can be identified using primers 8981g0F with HY and verified by primers 8981g1F and 8981g1R. C. PCR screening and verification of <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted mutants in Sn1501. The primer 8981g0F (g0F) located outside of the &#x223C;1.2 kb region along with primer HY amplify a &#x223C;2.9 kb fragment in strains which have <italic>SnTox3</italic> disrupted by the insertion. No amplification is observed in wild type and ectopics. The primers 8981g1F1 (g1F) and 8981g1R (g1R) amplify a &#x223C;1.2 kb fragment in the wild type and ectopic strains indicating the <italic>SnTox3</italic> gene remains intact, while they amplify a &#x223C;3.8 kb fragment (&#x223C;1.2 kb of <italic>SnTox3</italic> region plus &#x223C;2.6 kb of <italic>cpc-1</italic>:<italic>HYG</italic> :<italic>tryptophan c</italic> cassette) in the <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains. D. RT-PCR verification of different mutated strains. The primers 8981cF and 8981cR which amplify the <italic>SnTox3</italic> ORF region were used to test the presence of transcripts of <italic>SnTox3</italic> in different isolates and genetically modified strains including Sn79-1087 and its two transformed <italic>SnTox3+</italic> strains (Sn79+SnTox3A and Sn79+SnTox3B) and Sn1501 and its two <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A and Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B along with the ectopic transformant Sn1501Ect.

Culture filtrates from the two transformants were also infiltrated into all 118 RI lines in the BG mapping population to verify that sensitivity mapped to the <italic>Snn3</italic> locus. As expected, sensitivity to culture filtrates of both transformants in the BG population was conferred by a single gene and mapped to chromosome arm 5BS at the <italic>Snn3</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref>.

This isolate caused typical <italic>S. nodorum</italic> lesions on Grandin and BG220 which contain <italic>Snn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). No visible lesions were observed on the <italic>snn3</italic> lines BR34, BG261 and BG223.

Two of the <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains, designated Sn1501&#x394;Tox3A and Sn1501&#x394;Tox3B, and one ectopic strain, designated Sn1501Ect, were selected for further analysis. PCR, Southern blotting and RT-PCR confirmed the gene-disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g006">Figure 6A, 6C and 6D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The culture filtrates of four strains were tested on the SnTox3 differential line BG220 and the results showed that the wild type (Sn1501) and ectopic transformants (Sn1501Ect) were able to produce SnTox3. The two strains harboring the mutated <italic>SnTox3</italic> did not produce active SnTox3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that SnTox3 was non-functional in these two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Sn1501 wild type, Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A, Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B, and Sn1501Ect were inoculated onto the SnTox3 differential line BG220. Sn1501 and Sn1501Ect induced typical lesions on BG220, whereas only small white flecks were present without any visible lesions on the leaves inoculated with Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A and Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B, indicating the mutants were avirulent on BG220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Compared to the wild type, the two <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains also showed decreased virulence toward the parental line Grandin which also contains <italic>Snn3</italic>; however, <italic>SnTox3</italic> disruption did not change the reaction towards parental line BR34 or the SnToxA and SnTox2 differential lines BG261 and BG223 respectively, which do not harbor <italic>Snn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000581.s007">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>The four strains Sn1501, Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A, Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B, and Sn1501Ect were also inoculated onto the entire BG population in order to quantify the effect of the SnTox3-<italic>Snn3</italic> interaction using QTL analysis. For wild type Sn1501, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref>, significant QTLs were detected on the distal end of chromosome 2DS and 5BS which corresponded to <italic>Snn2</italic> (SnTox2 sensitivity) and <italic>Snn3</italic>, respectively. The <italic>Snn2</italic> and <italic>Snn3</italic> loci explained 46% and 10% of the variation in disease, respectively. The same two QTLs with similar effects (46% and 13%) were found to be associated with susceptibility to the Sn1501Ect strain. For the two <italic>SnTox3</italic>-disrupted strains Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3A and Sn1501&#x394;SnTox3B, QTL analysis showed that the <italic>Snn2</italic> locus explained 60 and 64% of the variation, respectively, and the effects of the <italic>Snn3</italic> locus were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g008">Figure 8</xref>) showing that SnTox3 specifically interacts with <italic>Snn3</italic> and the loss of SnTox3 does not negatively affect the SnTox2-<italic>Snn2</italic> interaction.

        <title>Preliminary characterization of the SnTox3 protein</title>
        <p>The predicted SnTox3 pre-protein contains 230 amino acids with a calculated mass of 25.85 kDa. SnTox3 activity was detected in culture filtrates and both SignalP 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>) and WolfPsort (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wolfpsort.org/">http://wolfpsort.org/</ext-link>) signal peptide prediction software predicted that the first 20 amino acids are a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g002">Figure 2</xref>) necessary for the secretion of the protein.</p>
        <p>SnTox3 contains six cysteine residues. Using DISULFIND at the website of PredictProtein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.predictprotein.org">http://www.predictprotein.org</ext-link>), six cysteine residues in the SnTox3 protein were predicted to form three disulfide bonds with a confidence level of 9 (0&#x2013;9 scale) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000581-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The best connectivity pattern based on the prediction is C89&#x2013;C209, C154&#x2013;C203, and C166&#x2013;C218. These disulfide bridges may play an important role in the stability of the protein.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Until recently, the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat pathosystem was thought to be based on the interaction of a suite of non-specific toxins and cell wall degrading enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Solomon2">[24]</xref>. No specific variation in virulence on the host was recognized. Resistance was quantitative and defined as a plethora of mostly weak and environment-specific QTL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen1">[14]</xref>. As a result, breeding for disease resistance was based on simple phenotypic assessment; no molecular markers were in use.</p>
      <p>The assembly of critical tools including functional genomics, host mapping populations, and the genome sequence has allowed the role of pathogen-produced effectors (HSTs) to be revealed. We previously characterized the SnToxA-<italic>Tsn1</italic> interaction in which some isolates produced different variants of ToxA that interact directly or indirectly with the product of the wheat gene <italic>Tsn1</italic> to produce a necrotic reaction that benefits the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen2">[15]</xref>. Three additional toxin/receptor interactions have been partially characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Liu1">[18]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref>. Together, these findings have opened up a rational route to the genetic control of this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Oliver1">[25]</xref> where pathogen produced effectors (HSTs) interact with dominant host gene products. But in contrast to effector triggered immunity (ETI) found in many biotrophic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Boller1">[26]</xref>, the end result in the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat interaction is effector triggered susceptibility (ETS).</p>
      <p>Proteomic analysis of purified active fractions identified the candidate gene <italic>SNOG_08981</italic>. A range of tests presented here provided convincing and comprehensive evidence that the candidate gene <italic>SNOG_08981</italic> corresponds to <italic>SnTox3</italic> and that addition or ablation of SnTox3 changes the specificity of the corresponding fungal strains on the differential line harboring the host gene <italic>Snn3</italic>.</p>
      <p><italic>SnTox3</italic> is an intron-free 693 nucleotide gene encoding a predicted 230 amino acid immature protein. MS and MS/MS spectra of the digested protein identified 44% of the total sequence, including amino acids from position 73 to the C-terminus. The first 20 amino acids make up a predicted signal sequence that likely serves as a signal peptide for secretion. This is consistent with the detection of SnTox3 activity in the culture filtrate of fungal isolates that harbor <italic>SnTox3</italic>. As amino acids 21 through 72 are not accounted for by MS and also SnTox3 was observed as an &#x223C;18 kDa protein on SDS-PAGE, it is likely that SnTox3 is a pre-pro protein similar to ToxA and that the mature protein requires the cleavage of an additional N-terminal region including part or all of amino acids 21 to 72. It is interesting to note that immediately before the first peptide identified by mass spectrometry, there are four residues (LSKR) similar to an LRKR sequence in the effector protein Six1 which is predicted as a Kex2-like protease recognition site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Rep1">[27]</xref>. The calculated molecular weight for the remainder of the protein is 17.88 kDa similar to what we observed for SnTox3 using SDS-PAGE. Additional work is ongoing to verify the N-terminal region of the mature protein.</p>
      <p>SnTox3 is a unique protein and presently has no obvious homology to other proteins present in current protein databases other than <italic>S. nodorum</italic>. Many pathogen proteins that are secreted into host environments containing many plant proteases are rich in cysteine residues. These cysteine residues often form disulfide bonds that play a critical role in folding or stability of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Rep1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Luderer1">[28]</xref>. SnTox3 contains six cysteine residues which are predicted to form three disulfide bonds and the loss of SnTox3 activity after reduction of the protein by DTT treatment indicates that the formation of at least one disulfide bond is critical for its biological function.</p>
      <p><italic>SnTox3</italic> is expressed at high levels especially early in infection as well as in culture. The <italic>in planta</italic> transcription profile is similar to that of <italic>ToxA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen2">[15]</xref>. It is consistent with a model whereby the role of SnTox3 is to induce necrosis in susceptible host cells ahead of tissue colonization. Once the host tissue becomes necrotic, it is appropriate that <italic>SnTox3</italic> expression is reduced as the fungus prepares to disseminate via sporulation.</p>
      <p>In the assembled <italic>S. nodorum</italic> genome, <italic>SnTox3</italic> is located on the end of supercontig 14 (&#x223C;1.2 Mb), however it is not clear whether this supercontig constitutes an entire chromosome. Although <italic>SnToxA</italic> lies in the middle of a very short supercontig (supercontig 55, &#x223C;32 Kb), CHEF gel analysis showed it to be in a 2.35 Mb chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen2">[15]</xref>. Using Southern analysis of the same CHEF blot, an <italic>SnTox3</italic> probe hybridized to a significantly smaller band (data not shown), indicating <italic>SnToxA</italic> and <italic>SnTox3</italic> are located in different chromosomes. It is striking that both <italic>SnTox3</italic> and <italic>SnToxA</italic> are flanked by an AT-rich sequence that contains long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Hane1">[11]</xref>. We note that many other fungal avirulence and HST genes are surrounded by repetitive DNA. <italic>AvrLm1</italic> and <italic>AvrLm6</italic> conferring avirulence in <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> were also found residing in a genomic region rich in LTR transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Gout1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Fudal1">[30]</xref>. Similarly, avirulence genes in <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>, were surrounded by repetitive elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Rep2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Houterman1">[32]</xref>, and <italic>Magnaporthe grisea</italic> avirulence genes are also found near repetitive elements and telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Zhou1">[33]</xref>. The significance of the presence of these genes in repetitive regions has yet to be determined, but it does suggest another means to identify candidate genes from sequenced fungal genomes.</p>
      <p>Recent research in the area of pathogen effectors and host recognition has led to the theory that two layers of plant resistance are present. In the initial layer of plant defense, pathogen or microbe associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the plant cell surface, leading to PAMP triggered immunity (PTI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Boller1">[26]</xref>. Pathogens can produce effectors to elude or inhibit PTI and these effectors can then be recognized in a second layer of host defense known as effector triggered immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Boller1">[26]</xref>. In this second layer of defense, the plant receptors are typically nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins which trigger resistance after direct or indirect recognition of the corresponding pathogen produced effector. Interestingly, two recent discoveries of host genes involved in HST susceptibility have been shown to be in the NB-LRR family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Lorang1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Nagy1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat interaction is a necrotrophic pathogen system where, like many necrotrophic systems, the pathogen induces cell death via HSTs and then thrives on dying tissue, leading to sporulation of the pathogen. Based on what is known about the ToxA-<italic>Tsn1</italic> model, Ptr ToxA and presumably SnToxA is recognized by the host within a few hours of infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Kwon1">[36]</xref> and internalized into the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Manning1">[17]</xref> followed by a cascade of events involving host transcription and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Kwon2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Rasmussen1">[38]</xref> leading to a susceptible response. Evidence suggests that <italic>Tsn1</italic>, the wheat gene associated with ToxA sensitivity in the <italic>S. nodorum</italic> and <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> systems, is also a member of the NB-LRR family (Faris et al. unpublished data) implicating another resistance-like gene in effector triggered susceptibility by a necrotrophic fungus.</p>
      <p>In the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat interaction, evidence has been shown for a complex of at least four pathogen-produced effector proteins each with a distinct corresponding dominant host gene that confers susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen1">[14]</xref>, one of which is likely a member of the NB-LRR gene family. The <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat interaction is the inverse of the biotrophic host pathogen model of effector triggered immunity, in that cell death is favorable to pathogen virulence rather than to host resistance. The current work adds strength to the hypothesis that disease in the SNB system is a result of multiple effector proteins which, when produced by the pathogen, lead to effector triggered susceptibility (ETS) rather than effector triggered immunity (ETI), but possibly via pathways involving resistance-like genes. This is likely the case in other necrotrophic systems involving both proteinaceous and non proteinaceous HSTs.</p>
      <p>A screen of a global sample of <italic>S. nodorum</italic> field populations revealed that 39.9% of tested strains lacked <italic>SnTox3</italic> and there was considerable variation in the observed frequency of <italic>SnTox3</italic> among geographical regions. Very similar findings emerged from an analysis of <italic>SnToxA</italic> using the same isolates, though <italic>SnToxA</italic> was deleted in almost two thirds of the tested isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Stukenbrock1">[39]</xref>. Data for both toxins were obtained from 849 of the field isolates; 164 isolates tested positive for both toxins, while 293 isolates had neither toxin. The latter finding suggests that these two toxins are not required for pathogenicity and that additional toxins or other factors are likely to be active in modern field populations of <italic>S. nodorum</italic>. The remaining isolates carried only one out of the two toxins discussed above. For <italic>SnToxA</italic> we hypothesized that the frequency of the gene in <italic>S. nodorum</italic> populations reflected the frequency of the <italic>Tsn1</italic> sensitivity gene in the corresponding wheat populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Stukenbrock1">[39]</xref>. Some evidence to support this hypothesis came from recent work in Australia where all of the tested <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolates carried <italic>ToxA</italic>. Oliver et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Oliver2">[40]</xref> showed that more than 90% of modern Australian wheat cultivars carry the corresponding <italic>Tsn1</italic> sensitivity allele. We propose the same mechanism to explain the observed differences in <italic>SnTox3</italic> frequencies among regional populations, with frequencies of <italic>SnTox3</italic> reflected by the frequencies of <italic>Snn3</italic> in the corresponding wheat populations. Sequence analysis of <italic>SnTox3</italic> loci revealed diversity at both the nucleotide and amino acid level that was similar to that observed for <italic>SnToxA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Stukenbrock1">[39]</xref>. <italic>SnTox3</italic> was sequenced from 245 isolates. Two of the protein variants comprised approximately 97% of the isolates, with the other two variants being rare. All four proteins exhibited full biological activity, and thus virulence, on wheat varieties carrying <italic>Snn3</italic>.</p>
      <p>The availability of SnTox3 will allow wheat geneticists and breeders to use SnTox3 to identify and eliminate <italic>Snn3</italic> in germplasm. <italic>SnTox3</italic> is only the second gene cloned from the SNB system that encodes a proteinaceous necrosis inducing toxin and therefore can be used in conjunction with <italic>SnToxA</italic> to continue to evaluate the mechanism by which <italic>S. nodorum</italic> infects wheat. This susceptibility inducing effector protein is one of only a handful of proteinaceous HSTs identified and therefore is a valuable addition to the expanding body of knowledge specific to necrotrophic plant pathogen interactions, especially in the important Dothideomycete class. On a broader level, the cloning of <italic>SnTox3</italic> provides an additional tool to investigate how necrotrophic fungi benefit from susceptibility-inducing effector proteins.</p>
      <p><italic>S. nodorum</italic> is a member of the Dothideomycete class of fungi which is a newly classified and large fungal taxon including many important necrotrophic pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Schoch1">[41]</xref>. In addition to <italic>S. nodorum</italic> and <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic>, proteinaceous HSTs have recently been reported from other Dothideomycete species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Barthe1">[6]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Sarpeleh1">[8]</xref>. It is possible that multiple interactions similar to the <italic>S. nodorum</italic>-wheat interaction are also present in other Dothideomycete disease systems. As the first Dothideomycete species to be sequenced, <italic>S. nodorum</italic> may serve as a model to study the necrotrophic pathogen lifestyle including the interaction with its host.</p>

        <title>Purification of SnTox3</title>
        <p>SnTox3 was partially purified and characterized as described in Friesen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref> using <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate Sn1501. Recently the highly virulent North Dakota <italic>S. nodorum</italic> isolate Sn4, was identified as a better toxin producer, therefore this isolate was used for production of SnTox3. Culture filtrate production and partial purification was done as described by Friesen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Friesen4">[20]</xref> with some modifications. Briefly, initial purification steps were conducted using the &#xC4;KTA prime plus (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) liquid chromatography system. In order to obtain enough protein for mass spectrometry, &#x223C;300 ml of 3 week old fungal culture filtrate was dialyzed overnight against a water using a 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis tubing (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The dialyzed culture filtrate was loaded onto a HiPrep SPXL 16/10 cation exchange column (GE Healthcare Piscataway, NJ) after pre-equilibration with the same buffer used in dialysis. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 50 ml of 20 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 followed by a gradient elution of 0&#x2013;300 mM sodium chloride plus 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min over 20 min. The 5 ml fractions were collected and tested on the SnTox3 differential line BG220. The most active fraction was used for size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30 prep-grade gel filtration column. The sample was injected using a 5 ml loop and 20 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5.0 running buffer was used with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a fraction size of 5 ml. The size-based fraction containing SnTox3 was further separated using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The sample was loaded into a precast 16.5% tris-tricine polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and subjected to electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad Mini PROTEAN 3 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using the buffer system of Sh&#xE4;gger and von Jagow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000581-Schgger1">[42]</xref>. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue solution (0.2% Coomassie Blue R250, 7.5% acetic acid and 50% ethanol) to visualize the protein bands. Based on a pre-stained protein standard (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), the bands within the expected size range (10&#x2013;30 kDa) were excised individually from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis.</p>

        <title>Mass spectrometry and identification of the SnTox3-encoding gene</title>
        <p>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with automated tandem time of flight fragmentation of selected ions (MALDI-TOF/TOF) of trypsin digested proteins were acquired with a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the positive reflectron mode. Spectra were obtained by averaging 1000 and 2500 acquired spectra in the MS and MS/MS mode, respectively. Post source decay fragmentation MS/MS spectra of selective peptides were obtained with 1 keV acceleration voltage. Conversion of TOF to mass (Da) for the monoisotopic ions, [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, was based on calibration of the instrument with a peptide standard calibration kit (Applied Biosystems).

Boston, MA) search engine through GPS Explorer Software (Applied Biosystems) with a 50 ppm and 0.1 Da error tolerance for MS and MS/MS spectra, respectively, one missed trypsin cleavage allowance, oxidation of methionine, and carbamidomethyl derivatization of reduced cysteine as a variable modification. The signal to noise ratio for peak filtering was set to 10 for MS and 20 for MS/MS. The threshold for proteins from database searches (MS+MS/MS and MS/MS) was set within a &#x2265;95% confidence interval (<italic>P</italic>&#x2265;0.05). Protein bands likely containing SnTox3 were subjected to digestion using Trypsin Gold, mass spectrometry grade (Promega Co., Madison, WI), following manufacture procedures and ZipTips protocols for sample cleaning and spotting in a MALDI plate.
