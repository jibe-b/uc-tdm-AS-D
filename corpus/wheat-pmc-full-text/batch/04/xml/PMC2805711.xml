      <abstract>
        <p>The vernalization gene 2 (<italic>VRN2</italic>), is a major flowering repressor in temperate cereals that is regulated by low temperature and photoperiod. Here we show that the gene from <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (<italic>TaVRN2</italic>) is also regulated by salt, heat shock, dehydration, wounding and abscissic acid. Promoter analysis indicates that <italic>TaVRN2</italic> regulatory region possesses all the specific responsive elements to these stresses. This suggests pleiotropic effects of TaVRN2 in wheat development and adaptability to the environment. To test if TaVRN2 can act as a flowering repressor in species different from the temperate cereals, the gene was ectopically expressed in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Transgenic plants showed no alteration in morphology, but their flowering time was significantly delayed compared to controls plants, indicating that <italic>TaVRN2</italic>, although having no ortholog in <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, can act as a flowering repressor in these species. To identify the possible mechanism by which <italic>TaVRN2</italic> gene delays flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the expression level of several genes involved in flowering time regulation was determined. The analysis indicates that the late flowering of the 35S::<italic>TaVRN2</italic> plants was associated with a complex pattern of expression of the major flowering control genes, <italic>FCA</italic>, <italic>FLC</italic>, <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>FVE</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic>. This suggests that heterologous expression of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can delay flowering by modulating several floral inductive pathways. Furthermore, transgenic plants showed higher freezing tolerance, likely due to the accumulation of <italic>CBF2</italic>, <italic>CBF3</italic> and the <italic>COR</italic> genes. Overall, our data suggests that <italic>TaVRN2</italic> gene could modulate a common regulator of the two interacting pathways that regulate flowering time and the induction of cold tolerance. The results also demonstrate that <italic>TaVRN2</italic> could be used to manipulate flowering time and improve cold tolerance in other species.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In temperate regions, low temperature (LT) constitutes a major factor that regulates flowering time and many developmental transitions such as germination, bud dormancy and bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Henderson1">[1]</xref>. In response to LT-conditions, plants cold acclimate and vernalize to prevent the sensitive floral meristem from freezing damages during the winter by postponing flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Fowler1">[2]</xref>. The ability of plants to switch from vegetative to reproductive phase after a long period of cold, a process known as vernalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Chouard1">[3]</xref>, allows plants to promote flowering early in the spring. During this cold exposure period, LT-responsive genes <italic>CBFs</italic> (<italic><underline>C</underline>-repeat <underline>b</underline>inding <underline>f</underline>actor</italic>) and <italic>COR</italic> (<italic><underline>Co</underline>ld <underline>R</underline>egulated</italic>) are activated, allowing plants to increase their tolerance to cold and survive the winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Thomashow1">[4]</xref>). Cereals are classified into spring and winter growth habit according to their vernalization requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Michaels1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Pugsley1">[6]</xref>. Spring varieties do not respond to vernalization and flower rapidly whereas winter varieties have a quantitative vernalization requirement. Therefore, winter varieties require vernalization to accelerate flowering and complete their life cycle. Understanding the genetic/molecular basis of both LT-responsive pathways (cold acclimation and vernalization), can help to better manipulate, the two important agronomical traits flowering and freezing tolerance.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, two key loci <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>) and <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) determine the difference in the flowering time and freezing tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Koornneef1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-NappZinn1">[8]</xref>. Spring ecotypes such as <italic>Landsberg erecta</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> have a non-functional <italic>FRI</italic> and/or a weak allele of <italic>FLC</italic> whereas winter annuals such as <italic>Stokholm</italic> and <italic>San Felieu2</italic> have functional <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Michaels1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Johanson1">[9]</xref>). <italic>FLC</italic>, a MADS-box gene, is the central regulator of flowering through the vernalization pathway. A high level of FLC expression (RNA and protein) induces a very late-flowering phenotype in winter annual ecotypes. In contrast, repression of FLC by vernalization causes an early-flowering phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Michaels2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Sheldon1">[11]</xref>. A recent study showed that FRI, which encodes a novel nuclear protein with no conserved domains except for two coiled coil regions, delays flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> through a co-transcriptional mechanism involving direct interaction with the nuclear cap binding complex, with concomitant effects on FLC mRNA splicing and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Geraldo1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In cereals, vernalization and cold acclimation regulatory gene networks are also interconnected but are regulated by different factors. It was hypothesized that the temperate cereals have evolved the ability to use the presence of <italic>VRN1</italic> in the leaves as a signal to down regulate the <italic>COR</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Danyluk1">[13]</xref>. This hypothesis does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>CBF</italic> or <italic>COR</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Galiba1">[14]</xref>. However, the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in the association between the up regulation of VRN1 and the down regulation of COR genes are not yet determined. Genetic analysis and expression profiling studies in wheat showed that <italic>VRN1</italic> transcript accumulation is associated with the vernalization response and the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Danyluk1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Murai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Yan1">[16]</xref>. <italic>VRN1</italic> encodes a FRUITFULL-like MADS-box protein that belongs to the AP1/SQUA-like clade of transcriptional regulators whose members have been implicated in meristem identity and flower development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Ferrandiz1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Mandel1">[18]</xref>. VRN2 is a zinc finger transcription factor that acts as a dominant negative regulator of flowering time in the vernalization pathway in wheat and barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Karsai1">[19]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Yan2">[21]</xref>. Reducing <italic>VRN2</italic> level by RNAi accelerates flowering in hexaploid wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Yan2">[21]</xref>. Thus, there are obvious differences in the flowering regulation pathway between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and cereals. No genes corresponding to <italic>FLC</italic> were found in monocots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Hecht1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Lee1">[23]</xref>) as well no TaVRN2 orthologs were detected in <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Yan2">[21]</xref>. These observations suggest that monocots and dicots have separately evolved their vernalization pathway recruiting different components for analogous functions. The reciprocal control of flowering by the rice <italic>SOC1</italic> gene in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and by the <italic>Arabidopsis FLC</italic> gene in transgenic rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Tadege1">[24]</xref> was an indication that the flowering genes from one species could be used to manipulate flowering time in other species. In support of this hypothesis we showed that overexpressing the wheat MADS-box genes <italic>TaVRN1</italic> or <italic>TaVRT2</italic> modulates flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Adam1">[25]</xref>. This cross species function of flowering genes may help to understand the evolution of the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization and flowering time in plants.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we provide further evidence of the cross species function of flowering genes. We showed that the wheat vernalization gene <italic>TaVRN2</italic> can act as a flowering repressor outside the cereal group. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic plants expressing <italic>TaVRN2</italic> showed a late-flowering phenotype and enhanced freezing tolerance without any alteration in their morphology. These modifications are associated with changes in the expression of the flowering and freezing tolerance responsive genes.</p>

        <p>Two wheat varieties (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, 2n&#xD7;6&#x200A;=&#x200A;42), a spring habit cultivar Manitou and a winter habit cultivar Norstar, were grown in a controlled growth chamber as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Danyluk1">[13]</xref>. Briefly, plants were grown in a growth chamber at 20&#xB0;C under long days (LD) (16 h at 320 &#xB5;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) or short days (SD) (8 h at 320 &#xB5;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) conditions. For vernalization treatment, 14 days old plants were grown at 4&#xB0;C for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 77 and 98 days under either SD and LD.</p>
        <p>For abiotic stress treatment, 7 days old wheat plants were treated as follows: for cold, seedlings were cold treated for one day at 4&#xB0;C (CA); for heat shock, they were exposed at 40&#xB0;C for 1 and 3 h; wounding stress was induced by cutting seedlings into 1 cm segments and placing them in water at 20&#xB0;C for 3 and 14 h; salt-stressed plants were obtained by incubating seedlings for 18 h with 300 or 500 mM NaCl; water stress was induced by removing seedlings from vermiculite and leaving them at 20&#xB0;C without water for different time periods, after which the relative water content (RWC) was evaluated; for ABA treatment, 100 mM ABA in 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20 for 18 h were sprayed on seedlings.</p>
        <p>For genes expression, flowering time (leaf number) and freezing experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, seeds were put on soil and kept in a cold room (4&#xB0;C) in the dark for 2 days. After this treatment, seeds were transferred to a growth chamber at 20&#xB0;C under long days (16 h at 120 &#xB5;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) conditions. For the cold treatment, 15 days old plants grown at 20&#xB0;C under long day were transferred to 4&#xB0;C for four weeks. Flowering time was measured as the number of rosette leaves every week.</p>

        <title>Determination of freezing tolerance</title>
        <p>A Caltec Scientific Ltd. Model 8-792 Large Capacity Temperature Stress Chamber was used to perform the FT tests. This instrument consists of four major component systems: a Sanyo Model MDF-792 24.75 ft<sup>3</sup> capacity ultra-low temperature chest freezer, a custom designed stainless steel plenum box with its integral blower and heater (provides air circulation and heating) and an Omega Engineering Inc. Model CN3002 programmable profile controller (monitors the test-chamber air temperature). The controlled action of the heater combines with the constant cooling of the freezer to achieve the desired temperature at any given time.</p>
        <p>Non-acclimated (NA) and cold-acclimated (CA) plants were grown in soil for 3 weeks and subjected to the following freezing treatment. The temperature was lowered gradually to &#x2013;6.5&#xB0;C for NA and to &#x2013;10.5&#xB0;C for CA plants (2&#xB0;C h<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>) and maintained at this temperature for 6 h. The temperature was then gradually increased to 4&#xB0;C. To determine temperature variability in the freezer, temperatures were monitored by four independent thermocouples T probes distributed in the freezer and connected to an Agilent 3497-0A data acquisition/switch unit. Freezing regimes that showed more than 0.5&#xB0;C discrepancies between the different probes were rejected. To minimize light stress effect after the freezing treatment, plants were thawed at 4&#xB0;C for 24 h in the dark and then moved to growth chamber (20&#xB0;C) under low light for an additional 24 h before returning to normal light conditions. Representative pictures were taken 2 weeks after the freezing test. Eighteen plants were frozen per line per assay, and the experiment was repeated at least three times.</p>

        <p>Total RNAs were isolated from wheat plants as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Charron1">[27]</xref>, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR thermal-cycling parameters were 50&#xB0;C for 2 min, 95&#xB0;C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95&#xB0;C for 20 sec and 60&#xB0;C for 1 min. For qRT-PCR, relative transcript abundance was calculated and normalized with respect to 18S ribosomal RNA transcript levels. Data shown represent mean values obtained from four independent amplification reactions, and the error bars indicate the &#xB1;SE of the mean. Each experiment was repeated three times. TaqMan primers set were designed according to the specific sequence of the target gene (Invitrogen) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008690.s001">Table S1</xref>). All calculations and analyses were performed using SDS RQ Manager 1.1 software using the 2<sup>&#x2212;&#x394;&#x394;</sup>Ct method with a relative quantification (RQ)min/RQmax confidence set at 95% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Livak1">[28]</xref>. The error bars display the calculated maximum (RQmax) and minimum (RQmin) expression levels that represent SE of the mean expression level (RQ value). The upper and lower limits define the region of expression within which the true expression level value is likely to occur (SDS RQ Manager 1.1 software user manual; Applied Biosystems). Amplification efficiency (98% to 100%) for the two primer sets was determined by amplification of cDNA dilution series using 80, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 ng per reaction (data not shown).

The PCR thermal-cycling parameters were 94&#xB0;C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94&#xB0;C for 20 sec and 58&#xB0;C for 1 min and an extension of 72&#xB0;C for 10 min. Each value is the mean of four separate qPCR reaction normalized to <italic>ACTIN2</italic>. Each experiment was repeated two times using RNA prepared from two biological samples with similar results.</p>

        <p>Two <italic>TaVRN2</italic> sequences were cloned from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv Norstar. The first sequence of 642 bp length was PCR-amplified from wheat cDNA libraries and the second copy of 621 bp length was amplified from genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008690.s002">Sequences S1</xref>). Alignment at the nucleotide level showed 97% identity between the two sequences with deletion of 21 bp in the first exon and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). BLAST search at the DNA level revealed that the expressed sequence cloned from the cDNA libraries shared 96% identity with <italic>TmVRN2</italic> (AY485963.1) from the <italic>T. monoccocum</italic> that carries the diploid genome (AA). This relative low identity suggests that the 642 bp sequence is not the copy A. However, it shows a very good score with the Zinc finger-CCT domain gene (<italic>ZCCT1-B1</italic>) of <italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> ssp. dicoccon; AB genome. A homology search also shows that the 621 bp sequence has 99% identity with the A genome of <italic>TdVRN2</italic> (AY485979.1) indicating that the 621 bp could be assigned as the copy A of <italic>TaVRN2</italic>. Using genomic DNA extracted from ditelocentric wheat lines, the 621 bp sequence was mapped on chromosome 5A whereas the 642 bp sequence was mapped on chromosome 4B as recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Distelfeld1">[29]</xref>. Together with the DNA homology, the data indicate that the 642 bp sequence represents the copy B of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> gene (so-called <italic>TaVRN-B2</italic>) and the 621 bp sequence represents the copy A of the gene (<italic>TaVRN-A</italic>2).</p>
        <p>At the protein level, TaVRN-A2 has a seven amino acid deletion (His 49-His 55) compared to TaVRN-B2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Structural analysis of these two proteins indicated the presence of a zinc-finger DNA binding domain located in the first exon and a CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like and TOC) dimerization domain in the second exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The protein alignment of the two copies is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g001">figure 1B</xref>. The alignment of the CCT domain of TaVRN-A2 and TaVRN-B2 shows four silent polymorphisms and a substitution of a cytosine by a thymine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). This polymorphism changes the amino acid codon at position 35 of the CCT domain from arginine to tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To test if <italic>TaVRN2</italic> homeologous genes show differential expression patterns, qRT-PCR were performed using specific primers designed to preferentially amplify the A and B copies. The results indicated that the transcripts of the two homologous genes are regulated by LT exposure in the winter genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The transcripts level of the two copies remains high during the early stage of LT exposure and starts to decline toward the vernalization saturation point, where the low temperature treatment no longer reduce the final leaf number (FLN). However, <italic>TaVRN-A2</italic> transcript accumulates to a lesser level compared to <italic>TaVRN-B2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

        <title>TaVRN2 acts as a flowering repressor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
        <p>To determine the function of TaVRN2 in modulating flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, transgenic plants expressing <italic>TaVRN-B2</italic> allele under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (<italic>35S::TaVRN2</italic>) were compared with wild type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Col-0) and transgenic plants expressing <italic>GUS</italic> under the control of the <italic>CaMV 35S</italic> promoter (<italic>35S::GUS</italic>). Among the <italic>35S::TaVRN2</italic> homozygous lines showing late flowering phenotypes under LD conditions, ten lines showing different levels of late flowering and transgene expression were randomly selected and brought to the next generation. These observations suggest that there is a correlation between phenotype and the transgene expression level. Based on the strength of the phenotype, seven of these lines were brought to the second generation for further analysis. Three independent lines that conserved the late flowering phenotypes were selected and brought to the third generation. Homozygous plants of the fourth generation were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The flowering time was measured by the number of rosettes of leaves when flowering occurs. The results show that this number was 10 leaves for control plants, and 15, 13 and 12 leaves for line1, line2 and line3 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This flowering time was delayed by 7 days (P&lt;0.01) in line 1 and 5 days in line 2 and 3 when grown under long day conditions confirming that the strength of delay of flowering was consistent with the transgene expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Effect of <italic>TaVRN-B2</italic> expression on flowering initiation and development is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Molecular characterization of <italic>VRN2</italic> in hexaploid wheat demonstrates sequence variations between the homologous <italic>TaVRN2</italic> genes. <italic>TaVRN-A2</italic> and <italic>TaVRN-B2</italic> exhibit marked sequence variation and higher level of transcript accumulation. This could be explained by the fact that the A, B and D genomes evolved at different rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Petersen1">[32]</xref>. This variation also supports the idea that various events of sequence changes have occurred in the evolutionary history of wheat homeologous genomes that diverged about 5.0&#x2013;6.9 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Allaby1">[33]</xref>. Indeed, since the polyploidization event of wheat, significant sequence changes have occurred that might cause mutation or lost of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> in modern (spring) wheat. Alignment of the CCT domain of TaVRN-A2 and TaVRN-B2 shows a point mutation at position 35 of the CCT domain, where a tryptophan (W) substitutes for an arginine (R) amino acid. Mutation within this domain results in that <italic>TaVRN-A2</italic> encodes a non-functional protein as shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Yan2">[21]</xref>. This observation may explain why <italic>TaVRN-A2</italic> is expressed at a very low level to the extent that we could not clone it from our cDNA libraries. It is not known, however, if the gene is expressed into non-functional proteins or is not translated at all.</p>
      <p>The <italic>TaVRN2</italic> genes are also regulated by photoperiod, dehydration, wounding, heat shock and ABA stresses. This indicates that <italic>TaVRN2</italic>, besides having a major role in regulating vernalization and photoperiod responses, might integrate signals from other environmental stresses to execute its functions during wheat adaptability and development. This is supported by the presence of several putative regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-elements in its promoter region. Down regulation of the flowering repressor <italic>TaVRN2</italic> under stress conditions could be used as a strategy to promote flowering and ensure the survival of the species. Flowering time could also be determine by combinatorial responses as in the case of <italic>TaVRN1</italic> and <italic>TaVRT2</italic>, which are regulated by the combination of both low temperature and day length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Danyluk1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Kane1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Kane2">[34]</xref>. However, the biological significance of the regulation of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> by several stresses requires further investigation.</p>
      <p>Transgenic <italic>35S::TaVRN2</italic> lines showed a late-flowering phenotype indicating that the repressive effects of TaVRN2 are recognized by certain proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowering pathways. In these lines, the expression level <italic>AtFVE</italic>, <italic>AtFT</italic> and <italic>AtSOC1</italic> was either slightly increased or similar after 7 days of growth under LD conditions. The increase was more evident after 14 days of growth. However, at both time points, the level of <italic>AtFLC</italic> in transgenic plants was 4 times higher than in control plants. This suggests that despite the observed increased of <italic>AtFVE</italic>, <italic>AtFT</italic> and <italic>AtSOC1</italic>, the <italic>AtFLC</italic> level still high enough to counteract the action of these flowering inducer genes and delays flowering time in plants overexpressing <italic>TaVRN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008690-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
      <p>A model where AtCO is recruited by another direct DNA-binding and interacts with AtFLC in <italic>35S::AtCO 35S::AtFLC</italic> transgenic plants to repress AtSOC1 factor was proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Hepworth1">[35]</xref>. TaVRN2 protein, a zinc finger transcription factor like AtCO, could bind the CCAAT sequence in the <italic>AtSOC1</italic> promoter and regulates its transcription. This hypothesis remains to be confirmed. Taken together, our data indicates that the late flowering of the 35S::<italic>TaVRN2</italic> plants was associated with a complex pattern of expression of the major flowering control <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes <italic>FCA</italic>, <italic>FLC</italic>, <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>FVE</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic>. This suggests that heterologous expression of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can also delay flowering by modulating several floral inductive pathways. In cereals, it has been reported that low temperature and daylength flowering-response pathways are integrated to control expression of VRN3 (the AtFT orthologue) and that might occur through regulation of VRN2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-HemmingMegan1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Yan3">[37]</xref>. In contrast, our data did not show a repression of <italic>AtFT</italic> by <italic>TaVRN2</italic> over-expression, suggesting the possibility of TaVRN2 may act through another pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Overexpressing <italic>TaVRN2</italic> in mutants of these flowering genes will provide the answer to the exact molecular and cellular function of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
      <p>It is known that the length of the vegetative phase in vernalization sensitive plants is associated with the development of freezing tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Fowler1">[2]</xref>. Plants lose their capacity to cold acclimate once the vernalization saturation point is achieved. Thus extending the vegetative phase in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by overexpressing <italic>TaVRN2</italic> should mimic low temperature response. Our data confirms this hypothesis and showed that the delay in the transition to the reproductive phase is associated with enhanced freezing tolerance. This increase in tolerance is partly due to the induction of <italic>AtCBFs</italic> and <italic>AtCORs</italic> genes. <italic>TaVRN2</italic> could have a dual role by regulating flowering time and response to cold as proposed for <italic>AtFVE</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008690-Kim1">[38]</xref>. However, the exact cellular functions of <italic>TaVRN2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> require further investigation.</p>
      <p>Flowering time in plants plays a major role in plant adaptation, particularly in temperate region. Premature flowering initiation has a negative effect on productivity. Thus, identifying key genes involved in regulating this important trait will facilitate the development of molecular markers that will be used in breeding programs. It will be of interest to extend the vegetative phase in cold sensitive species to avoid flowering under unfavorable condition. On the other hand, accelerating flowering could be useful to shorter the life cycle for certain species and thus maximize the use of land resources and increase yield.</p>
