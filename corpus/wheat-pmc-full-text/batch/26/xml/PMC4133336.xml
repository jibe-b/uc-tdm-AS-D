        <p>Plant phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLCs) function in several essential plant processes associated with either development or environmental stress. In this report, we examined the expression patterns of <italic>TaPLC1</italic> under drought and high salinity stress at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. <italic>TaPLC1</italic> mRNA was expressed in all wheat organs examined. U73122 and edelfosine, the PLC inhibitor, impaired seedling growth and enhanced seedling sensitivity to drought and high salinity stress. Though <italic>TaPLC1</italic> expression in wheat was lowest at the seedling stage, it was strongly induced under conditions of stress. When 6-day-old wheat seedlings were treated with 200 mM NaCl or 20% (w/v) PEG 6000 for 6 or 12 h, respectively, the <italic>TaPLC1</italic> transcript level increased by 16-fold compared to the control. Western blotting showed that the TaPLC protein concentration was also maintained at a high level from 24 to 48 h during stress treatment. Together, our results indicate the possible biological functions of <italic>TaPLC1</italic> in regulating seedling growth and the response to drought and salinity stress.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ability to respond to a variety of abiotic stress signals is crucial for plants. Studying the functions of stress-related genes is critical in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in plants <xref rid="pone.0105061-Fleury1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Nevo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In response to high salinity and drought stress, the expression of various genes involved either directly or indirectly in plant protection is altered. The products encoded by these genes include osmolytes, ion channels, receptors, calcium signaling components, and other regulatory signaling factors or enzymes <xref rid="pone.0105061-Tuteja1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Several studies have demonstrated the important role of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway at multiple developmental stages and in response to environmental stress in plants <xref rid="pone.0105061-Munnik1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0105061-Munnik2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLCs, PLCs) are essential enzymes in phosphoinositide signaling. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) upon activation, generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which are second messengers in the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway <xref rid="pone.0105061-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. PI-PLC can act on phosphatidylinositol 4-bisphosphate (PI4P) <italic>in</italic><italic>vitro</italic>. Plant PI-PLC signalling is differences and similarities to the mammalian paradigm. Higher plants lack IP3 receptor, a ligand-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, and PKC. Instead, plants seem to use their phosphorylated products, IP6 and PA, as signaling molecules <xref rid="pone.0105061-Munnik1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Munnik2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The first plant PLC gene to be identified was cloned from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> shoots, and it was found to exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity to animal <italic>PI-PLC</italic> genes <xref rid="pone.0105061-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Subsequently, Hirayama et al. <xref rid="pone.0105061-Hirayama1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> obtained a cDNA (<italic>AtPLC1</italic>) from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> shoots exposed simultaneously to dehydration and salt stress. To date, plant PLCs have been cloned in many plant species, including oat <xref rid="pone.0105061-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, soybean <xref rid="pone.0105061-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, potato <xref rid="pone.0105061-Kopka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <italic>Nicotiana rustica</italic>

The role and regulation of PLC isozymes have been well established in animals <xref rid="pone.0105061-Kadamur1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and their mode of action is considered to be different from that of plant PLCs. Despite conclusive data concerning the roles of PLCs in plant cells, little is known about their <italic>in planta</italic> regulation <xref rid="pone.0105061-Pokotylo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is one of the most important staple foods in the world. Drought and salt affect wheat plant growth and productivity, and reduce yields worldwide <xref rid="pone.0105061-Morran1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Evidence indicates that wheat PLCs (TaPLCs) play a role in the response of plants to abiotic stimuli. As early as 1992, PI-PLC activity was detected in the plasma membrane of wheat root cells <xref rid="pone.0105061-Melin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Pical2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Wheat PI-PLC is similar to that in other plants in that the substrate of TaPLC hydrolysis is phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and PIP2, and TaPLC is dependent on calcium ions for activity <xref rid="pone.0105061-Melin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Jones and Kochian <xref rid="pone.0105061-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> showed that the phytotoxic metal cation Al<sup>3+</sup> inhibited root growth. AlC1<sub>3</sub> and AI-citrate specifically inhibited PLC action in a dose-dependent manner and at physiologically relevant AI levels. Cerebroside C increases tolerance to chilling injury and alters the lipid composition of wheat roots, possibly due to a partial reduction in lipid peroxidation and alterations in lipid composition, including inhibition of the activities of PLC and phospholipase D (PLD) <xref rid="pone.0105061-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. There are two <italic>PLC</italic> genes in the wheat genome: <italic>TaPLC1</italic> and <italic>TaPLC2</italic> (GenBank: HM754654.1 and HM754653.1). <italic>TaPLC1</italic> was recently shown to interact with G&#x3B1; and to be involved in the response to cold stress in wheat <xref rid="pone.0105061-Khalil1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of <italic>TaPLC1</italic> in wheat plants exposed to salt and drought stress in order to provide data for the rational engineering of hardier versions of this plant.</p>

        <p>Seeds of wheat (Chinese Spring background) were briefly surface-sterilized in a solution of 70% (v/v) ethanol, followed by immersion in a 30% (v/v) commercial bleach solution for 10 min. They were then washed with sterilized water three times. Wheat plants were grown and maintained using a hydroponic system. Plates were incubated in a growth chamber under 16 h of light at 22&#xB0;C.</p>
        <p>For high salinity treatment and drought treatment, respectively, NaCl or PEG 6000 was added to the nutrient solution at increasing concentrations up to 200 mM NaCl or 20% PEG 6000. Wheat seedlings treated with various chemicals and stress elicitors along with control plants were sampled at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-treatment. In addition, various tissues, including roots, stems, leaves, and ear, were sampled at different developmental stages. All samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C.</p>
        <p>The shoot length, fresh weight of stressed-seedlings and several relevant physiological parameters were measured.

        <title>Phylogenetic analysis and expression patterns of <italic>TaPLCs</italic></title>
        <p>The <italic>T. aestivum</italic> genome carries two <italic>TaPLC</italic> genes; they possess the relatively simple structure of all plant PI-PLC, including X/Y catalytic domains, a C2 domain, and truncated EF-hand domains (Pokotylo et al., 2014). All higher plant PLCs share a common ancestor and are phylogenetically separated from human and yeast PI-PLC proteins <xref rid="pone.0105061-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of TaPLCs using plant PLC enzymes and found that the PLCs of monocots are separated from those of dicots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is interesting that the <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, has the smallest genome of known plants genomes, contains the most members of the PLC family based on current data, and that the two AtPLC isoforms (AtPLC1/3) were grouped together with the PLCs of monocots. Phylogenetic comparison suggests a single origin of the AtPLC and OsPLC genes, with subsequent expansion of the gene family by duplications <xref rid="pone.0105061-Tasma1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Pokotylo et al. <xref rid="pone.0105061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> think that progenitors of AtPLC1/AtPLC3 possibly arose from a single gene by a duplication event on chromosome 5, with a subsequent duplication and relocation of AtPLC3 to chromosome 4. Our phylogenetic analysis further shows that AtPLC1/3 might represent an evolution closely with monocots.</p>

        <title>The inhibition of PI-PLC decreased seedling growth and resistance to salt and drought stress</title>
        <p>Plant PLCs play roles both in regulating development-related processes and responses to stress. In plant development, they have been well characterized during polarized pollen growth. In our study, due to the large difference in expression between seedlings and old leaves, we examined the effects of TaPLC on seedling growth. U73122, a specific inhibitor of PI-PLC <xref rid="pone.0105061-Staxen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, is added on seeds or seedlings that the germination has already taken place and the radicle can be seen. After 3 days, the treated seeds and seedlings were both about 2 cm in length and fresh weight of each seedling was 0.068 g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g003">Figure 3</xref>), whereas the control seedlings, which were treated with U73343, an inactive analog of U73122, or DMSO, U73122 solvent, were already 3 cm in length and fresh weight of each seedling was 0.092 g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g003">Figure 3</xref>). When the treated-seeds with U73122 begun to emerge the radicle, the inhibitor was removed from the medium and the seedlings have also grown to 3 cm after 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These result showed that seedling growth rate was significantly reduced by U73122, whereas U73122 had no effect on seeds germination. Edelfosine, another PI-PLC inhibitor <xref rid="pone.0105061-Djafi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> was also be used to testing the seeds germination and seedlings growth. The similar results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that TaPLC is involved in the regulation of seedling growth. The seedlings resumed a normal growth rate when U73122 was removed from medium (data not showed). In addition, the results did not show the inhibition for U73122 or edelfosine on seeds germination. We further tested seeds germination using the two inhibitors and confirmed this result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105061.s002">Figure S2</xref>). PI-PLCs are often considered to be stress-activated enzymes <xref rid="pone.0105061-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We therefore examined the regulatory function of TaPLCs in wheat seedling growth during salt and drought treatment. Following treatment for 6 h with 200 mM NaCl or 20% PEG 6000, the leaf apex of the wheat seedlings began to wilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Six days later, the growth of the seedlings was severely impaired, leaves began to curl and yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In comparison, the seedlings pre-treated with U73122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4F and G</xref>) or edelfosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4H and I</xref>) showed enhanced sensitivity to high salt and drought stress. The seedling growth rate was significantly reduced by drought or salinity stress, and it was almost stagnated when the seedlings were further treated with the PI-PLC inhibitors, U73122 or edelfosine (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The seedlings treated with both PI-PLC inhibitor and environment stress condition had lower fresh weight (FW) and relative water content (RWC) than those with environment stimuli only (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>). In addition, biosynthesis of chlorophyll was more significantly inhibited and the malonaldehyde (MAD) contents were more accumulated in the both-treated-seedlings (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g005">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

        <title><italic>TaPLC</italic> is involved in wheat growth and the response to salt and drought stress</title>
        <p>Plants respond to environmental stresses at both the cellular and molecular levels by altering the expression of many genes via complex signaling pathways. The role of <italic>PI-PLC</italic> genes in plant development is multifaceted. Over-expression of <italic>BnPLC2</italic> was found to cause an early shift from vegetative to reproductive growth, with shorter maturation periods <xref rid="pone.0105061-Nokhrina1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0105061-Apostolakos1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Plant PLCs have been well studied during polarized pollen growth <xref rid="pone.0105061-Dowd1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the present study, we found that TaPLC is involved in regulating wheat seedling growth and the response to salt and drought stress using U73122 and edelfosine, both are specific antagonist of PI-PLC. First, U73122 or edelfosine inhibited seedling growth, the shoot length and fresh weight n&#xB0;p seedling of treated-seedlings were both lower than control, and slow-growing seedlings had lower RWC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Second, seedlings treated with U73122 or edelfosine showed enhanced sensitivity to salt and drought stress. After 6 h of exposure to 200 mM NaCl or 20% PEG 6000, wilting was observed at the leaf tips in wheat seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Six days later, all of the seedlings showed evident damage, with a growth decrease and other physiological phenotypes, such as wilting leaves caused by lower RWC, yellow leaves caused by lower content of chlorophyll and higher MAD contents indicate the damage of membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, the seedlings were still alive, and the inhibitory effect of stress on seedling growth was ameliorated when the stress was removed. In comparison, those seedlings whose leaves were treated with U73122 or edelfosine showed a more significant decrease of seedling length and fresh weight, and greater changes of the physiological parameters, such as much lower RWC or chlorophyll and higher content of MDA than before; finally the leaves turned brown, completely collapsed and died under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results confirm the regulatory effect of PI-PLC on plant growth in response to salt and drought stress.</p>
        <p>Pharmacological approaches for detection of gene function have been developed for a long time. There are two inhibitors for PI-PLC, U73122 and edelfosine, and both of them are often used to test the role of PI-PLC both in animals and plants <xref rid="pone.0105061-Djafi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Wong et al. <xref rid="pone.0105061-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> compared the effects of U73122 and the edelfosine on cytokinesis in cranefly and Drosophila spermatocytes. Their data showed that the effects of U73122 are indeed via PLC because U73122 and edelfosine produced similar effects on cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton organization. Djafi et al. <xref rid="pone.0105061-Djafi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> detected and evaluated the two inhibitors in identify genes regulated by a basal PI-PLC activity and showed that the effects of edelfosine and of U73122 are not independent, but inhibition of PI-PLC are common action. Till recently, U73122 was considered and used as the archetypal PI-PLC activity inhibitor and have been more used to research the plant PLC function <xref rid="pone.0105061-Djafi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, especially of participated response to abiotic stress, such as osmotic stress <xref rid="pone.0105061-Parre1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Ghars1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, heat stress <xref rid="pone.0105061-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and cold stress <xref rid="pone.0105061-Vergnolle1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Here we provided the evidence using U73122 and edelfosine that TaPLCs involved in the growth of wheat seedlings and response to salt and drought stress. It is noted that neither U73122 nor edelfosine has effect on seed germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105061.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, the pharmacology experiments couldn&#x2019;t confirm the PLC has no effect on seed germination. Because the inhibitors might not penetrate the seed coat and inhibit the role of PLC.</p>

        <title>TaPLC1 expression is induced by high salinity and drought stress</title>

Several isoforms of plant PLCs have been cloned from a number of species, and PLC signal systems have been shown to be involved in responses to various environmental stresses <xref rid="pone.0105061-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Hirayama1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The function of plant PLCs in response to stress is usually assessed using transcriptome data. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains nine <italic>AtPLC</italic> genes. <italic>AtPLC4</italic>, <italic>AtPLC5</italic>, and <italic>AtPLC7</italic> show similar stress-related induction patterns, including strong induction by salt and drought <xref rid="pone.0105061-Kopka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Tasma1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. <italic>ZmPLC1</italic> from maize (<italic>Zea mays L</italic>.) is up-regulated in response to dehydration <xref rid="pone.0105061-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and enhanced expression of sense ZmPLC1 has been shown to improve the drought tolerance of maize plants <xref rid="pone.0105061-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105061-Pokotylo2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this study, we found that <italic>TaPLC1</italic> expression in wheat was induced in response to high salt and drought stress at both the mRNA and protein levels. <italic>TaPLC1</italic> expression was very low in wheat seedlings under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g002">Figure 2</xref>), but was rapidly up-regulated under conditions of stress. The 16-fold change in <italic>TaPLC1</italic> expression was determined relative to untreated control plants and exhibited similarities with the results obtained for old leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105061-g007">7</xref>). These results imply that a rise in the expression of TaPLC1 in seedlings is an adaptive mechanism of plant development and the response to environmental changes. In plants, the PI-PLC isoform with the lowest expression level appears to be most susceptible to environmental stress. For example, all three <italic>StPLC</italic> genes are expressed in various tissues of potato; however, <italic>StPLC2</italic> mRNA expression was the lowest in expanded leaves of potato plants and was strongly induced by both wounding and wilting <xref rid="pone.0105061-Kopka1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. <italic>Vigna radiata L.</italic> also contains three <italic>VrPLC</italic> genes.

        <p>The various stress-responsive genes identified to date can be broadly categorized as early and late induced genes. The early genes, which encode many signaling components, are induced within minutes of stress signal perception and are often expressed transiently. Late induced genes are activated by stress more slowly, usually after hours of stress perception, and the expression of these genes is often sustained <xref rid="pone.0105061-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. <italic>TaPLC1</italic>, which encodes a signaling protein, seems to be both an early and late induced gene. The expression level of <italic>TaPLC1</italic> was rapidly induced several fold under salt and drought stress within 30 min, and 16-fold after 6 h (salt stress) or 12 h (drought stress). This is perhaps due to the various functions of the phosphoinositide signal system. <italic>Myo</italic>-inositol (Ins) derivatives represent a large family of molecules, many of which are involved in the response to osmotic stress. Some, such as IP6, the product of the stepwise phosphorylation of IP3, have two separate functions: signaling and storage. Storage IP6 is a source of both phosphate and Ins in storage tissues and can be used to produce compatible solutes as osmoprotectant to increase a plant&#x2019;s salt or drought tolerance. InsP6 signalling functions are short-ranged and much faster, such as to release intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, to affect local gene expression and to activate F-box related signalling pathways <xref rid="pone.0105061-Munnik2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In addition, evidence suggests that the phosphoinositide signaling system in wheat is involved in the response of plants to salt and drought. Recently, a proteomic study of a tolerant genotype of durum wheat under salt-stress conditions showed significant changes in the expression of 83 proteins at high levels of salinity. One of these, inositol 3-phosphate synthase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in Ins biosynthesis; it was down-regulated at high levels of salinity <xref rid="pone.0105061-Capriotti1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4 kinases (PI4Ks) generate PI4-phosphate (PI4P), the precursor of regulatory phosphoinositides. PI4P is one of the substrates of PLC <xref rid="pone.0105061-Vermeer1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. A stress-inducible type II PI4K gene named TaPI4KII&#x3B3; was obtained by the <italic>de</italic>
<italic>novo</italic> transcriptome sequencing of drought-treated wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic>). Over-expression of TaPI4KII&#x3B3; revealed that the protein enhanced drought and salt stress tolerance during seed germination and seedling growth <xref rid="pone.0105061-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. DAG, another product of PI-PLC is further phosphorylated to PA via DAG kinase (DGK). Accumulating evidence suggests that PA plays a pivotal role in the plant&#x2019;s response to environmental signals <xref rid="pone.0105061-Arisz1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Recently, Djafi et al. <xref rid="pone.0105061-Djafi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> provided with suspension cells and seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that the inhibitors of PI-PLCs could also inhibit PA formation, showing that basal PI-PLCs act on gene expression through their coupling to DGKs, and some DREB2 genes, encode transcription factors with major roles in responses to environmental stresses, are up-regulated in presence of the inhibitors. Our expression data for <italic>TaPLC1</italic> confirm its role in the regulation of seedling growth and the response to salt and drought stress in <italic>T. turgidum</italic>. Although numerous studies have been conducted to understand how plants deal with salt and drought stress, many questions remain, including the mechanism by which these lipids signal and how osmotic stress activates phosphoinositide signaling <xref rid="pone.0105061-Munnik2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These questions will form the basis for future research and the components of phospholipids signals, such PA and DREB2, would be our concerns for further research. In addition, the activity of TaPLC will also be one of the priorities of our future work.</p>
