      <abstract>
        <p>Wheat starch degradation requires the synergistic action of different amylolytic enzymes. Our spatio-temporal study of wheat &#x3B1;-amylases throughout grain development shows that AMY3 is the most abundant isoform compared with the other known &#x3B1;-amylases. Endosperm-specific over-expression of AMY3 resulted in an increase of total &#x3B1;-amylase activity in harvested grains. Unexpectedly, increased activity did not have a significant impact on starch content or composition but led to an increase of soluble carbohydrate (mainly sucrose) in dry grain. In AMY3 overexpression lines (A3OE), germination was slightly delayed and triacylglycerol (TAG) content was increased in the endosperm of mature grain. Despite increased AMY3 transcript and protein content throughout grain development, alterations of &#x3B1;-amylase activity and starch granule degradation were not detected until grain maturation, suggesting a post-translational inhibition of &#x3B1;-amylase activity in the endosperm during the starch filling period. These findings show unexpected effects of a high level of &#x3B1;-amylase on grain development and composition, notably in carbon partitioning and TAG accumulation, and suggest the presence of a hitherto unknown regulatory pathway during grain filling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) has been recently described as the &#x201C;best known amylolytic enzyme&#x201D; (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Janecek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, the role of individual isoforms of &#x3B1;-amylase in cereal starch degradation remains unclear.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Starch is composed of two distinct fractions: amylopectin (highly branched, 75% of starch dried mass) and amylose (mostly linear, 25% of dried mass). Both are made of &#x3B1;-1,4 glucosidic bond glucose residues branched via &#x3B1;-1,6 glucosidic linkages (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ball and Morell, 2003</xref> for review). Starch is usually classified in two categories: (A) transitory starch, which accumulates in the chloroplasts of leaf cells during the day and is hydrolysed during the night and (B) reserve starch, which accumulates in the amyloplasts of starch storage organ cells, such as cereal endosperm or potato tuber, and is used during germination to fuel the first stages of seedling growth.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Starch degradation requires the orchestrated action of a range of enzymes including glucan water dikinases (GWD, PWD), phosphatases (starch excess 4 (SEX4), like-sex-four (LSF1 and LSF2)) and many amylolytic enzymes (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Blennow and Engelsen, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Ritte <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Streb <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The arsenal of enzymes mobilised to digest starch varies between species and starch type, depending on plant requirements (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In developing plants, degradation of transitory starch reaches completion at the very end of the night period (for review, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Graf and Smith, 2011</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Scialdone <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> have established a mathematical model that suggests a very precise control of the energy reserves throughout the non-photosynthetic period. Exo-amylases, such as &#x3B2;-amylases, or debranching enzymes, such as isoamylases or limit dextrinases, are the primary enzymes involved in transitory starch degradation. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants lacking &#x3B2;-amylase (BAM1) showed a severe starch excess phenotype associated with slower development owing to their inability to remobilize starch at night (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fulton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">To provide a steady supply of rapidly metabolised sugars such as glucose and maltose, starch needs to be degraded progressively during the night. Different control mechanisms have been proposed. Light-induced redox control or circadian rhythm are considered to be the primary factors behind regulation of starch degradation (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Mikkelsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Ral <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Carbon balance and sugar sensing have recently been described as another potential mechanism controlling starch degradation. <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Weise <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> reported that starch degradation was strongly controlled by the carbon balance, inhibited when the carbon presence is high and stimulated when the pool of carbon available is low. The work highlighted maltose and glucose as the primary metabolites produced from starch degradation to provide substrates for sucrose biosynthesis; they have been described as major regulators of starch degradation. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants unable to export maltose from the chloroplast accumulate chloroplastic maltose, which results in a severe starch excess phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Niittyl&#xE4; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). High levels of sucrose in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves have been shown to inhibit starch degradation strongly via another sugar-signalling metabolite, trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P). Although the mechanism underlying the inhibition of starch degradation by T6P remains unclear, leaf starch excess associated with altered starch granule morphology were described in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants accumulating T6P (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Martins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In non-photosynthetic organs, high levels of reserve starch need to be mobilized very rapidly during germination and early seedling growth. For most cereals, &#x3B1;-amylases are the primary enzymes responsible for starch degradation during germination. Alpha-amylases are endo-hydrolases belonging to the GH13 family (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Majzlova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The roles and number of isoforms vary across the plant kingdom. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, three isoforms have been described: AtAMY1, AtAMY2, and AtAMY3 (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). AtAMY3 is the only plastidic alpha-amylase, whereas AtAMY1 and AtAMY2 do not have any chloroplast targeting peptide (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Stanley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Initially AtAMY3 was thought not to be required for transitory starch metabolism, as mutation of the gene did not affect the starch biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, when AtAMY3 knock-out was combined with knock-outs of debranching enzyme and/or limit dextrinase deficient lines, the importance of AtAMY3 in transitory starch catabolism was demonstrated. AtAMY3 acts on starch granules producing short branched glucans within the chloroplast stroma. These branched glucans are then rapidly converted into maltose and glucose by debranching enzymes (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Streb <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). AtAMY3 has been demonstrated to be under redox control and potentially involved in redox-regulated, stress-induced starch degradation, particularly in response to osmotic stress or cold shock (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Seung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In barley there are at least four &#x3B1;-amylase categories from HvAMY1 to HvAMY4 (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Radchuk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), whereas rice contains multiple isoforms from ten separate genes clustered into three subfamilies (OsAMY1, OsAMY2 and OsAMY3, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). All subfamilies in barley or rice have been demonstrated to be expressed at different grain developmental stages and in various tissues (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hwang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In wheat, three isoforms of &#x3B1;-amylase have been clearly identified, and a fourth has been suggested based on detection of expression (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barrero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The two major isoforms, TaAMY1 and TaAMY2 have been extensively characterised and isolated based on their isoelectric point (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>). Wheat lines with abnormal accumulation of these &#x3B1;-amylases have reduced starch viscosity, which is correlated with poor flour quality, most notably in the case of TaAMY2 and pre harvest sprouting (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gubler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Mares and Mrva, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Although TaAMY1 and TaAMY2 have been well described, very little is known about TaAMY3 in wheat. However, the gene encoding TaAMY3 seems to be expressed throughout the grain development which implies a role in grain maturation (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Baulcombe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Here, we present the spatio-temporal characterization of wheat TaAMY3 and its relative importance compared with the other known &#x3B1;-amylases during kernel development. We also describe the development of endosperm-specific TaAMY3 overexpression wheat lines (A3OE) and the potential consequences of increased TaAMY3 activity on starch structure and granule morphology. We report unexpected effects of high levels of &#x3B1;-amylase level on grain composition, carbon partitioning, and lipid accumulation and finally speculate on the potential role of soluble carbohydrate in the regulation of starch metabolism during grain early development and grain filling.</p>

        <title>Engineered AMY3 profiling during grain development</title>
        <p>The presence of high levels of soluble carbohydrates, sucrose in particular, within the mature grain of the A3OE lines suggested an impact of TaAMY3 on the starch granules. However, the absence of a significant reduction in the total starch content of the mature grain despite very large increases on TaAMY3 activity suggests some limitations of TaAMY3 in hydrolysing the starch granule efficiently.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Therefore we assessed the total &#x3B1;-amylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>), the presence of the TaAMY3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), and starch granule morphology during grain development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Isogenic negative segregants showed a similar pattern to the wild-type wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) characterized by decreasing total &#x3B1;-amylase activity during grain development to nearly zero at maturity. The positive lines showed a similar pattern of decreasing total &#x3B1;-amylase activity up to 30 DPA, but then increased during maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). In negative segregants, TaAMY3 protein levels seemed to increase from 10 to 20 DPA, remain stable to 30 DPA and decrease to very low levels at maturity. In contrast, protein levels were highest in A3OE lines at 10 DPA, and decreased during development. Despite the steady decrease during development, protein levels were higher in A3OE lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Western-blot profiling showed the presence of two forms of TaAMY3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru299/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link>, available at <italic>JXB</italic> online) separated by a few kDa. In the A3OE line, the larger form was mainly present before and after the endosperm starch filling process and the smaller form was the dominant form detected during endosperm starch filling. Relative quantification measured with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry showed that peptides derived from the TaAMY3 protein were significantly higher (&#x2265;45-fold increase) in the A3OE lines than the negative segregants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru299/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>, available at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The importance of &#x3B1;-amylase during grain development has been previously suggested in cereal (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barrero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hwang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). However, results from this project have identified the relative importance of the specific isoform TaAMY3 and suggested the presence of an apparent control over &#x3B1;-amylase activity in wheat during the grain-filling process.</p>
      <sec id="s24">
        <title>TaAMY3 is the prevalent &#x3B1;-amylase isoform in developing wheat grains</title>
        <p>Grain development can be divided into three parts: cell division and endosperm differentiation from anthesis to 15 DPA; grain filling, where starch is accumulated in the endosperm, from 15 to 35 DPA; and grain desiccation and ripening from 35 DPA until dry (for review <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Evers, 1970</xref>). The length of each period is highly dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature, day length, or moisture (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Emes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The greater protein content of TaAMY3 compared with TaAMY2 at all sampled time points from 10&#x2013;30 DPA and the absence of detectable level of TaAMY1 indicates that TaAMY3 is the most abundant &#x3B1;-amylase isoform in wild-type developing wheat grains. The localization of protein to the pericarp and aleurone also suggests a well-controlled, tissue-specific regulation. In barley, it has been proposed that the pericarp of developing grains acts as a major short-term starch storage tissue, ensuring sink strength of the grain (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Radchuk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Noticeably, one pathway involving &#x3B1;-amylases occurs in tissues such as the pericarp and nucellus undergoing programmed cell death. Once accumulated during cell differentiation, starch is degraded during the seed-filling period, ensuring relocation of sugars (mainly sucrose) from the pericarp into the starchy endosperm.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Our goal was to investigate the effects of altering the controlled distribution of TaAMY3 during grain development and its implications for carbohydrate supply during germination. Therefore, we chose to use an endosperm-specific promoter, as no &#x3B1;-amylase isoform was found in that tissue in wild-type grain at 20 DPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Previous work has shown that a thermophilic &#x3B1;-amylase only expressed in non-endosperm tissues, spatially separated from starch, did not show any alterations in germination or development (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lanahan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and was only capable of hydrolysing starch after the tissue was ground.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Despite the over-expression construct being controlled by the endosperm specific promoter <italic>Bx17</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Ral <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), we have identified some ectopic non-endosperm transcript in line A10. However, the levels detected were low compared with those in the endosperm, and diminished with distance from the grain. There was also no detection of increased &#x3B1;-amylase activity outside of the endosperm, and no overall plant morphology or yield change in A10 line compared with the other A3OE lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/eru299/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>, available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Nevertheless, presence of elevated level of <italic>TaAmy3</italic> transcript outside of the grain in one of the A lines is intriguing and needs to be investigated further.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s25">
        <title>High endosperm &#x3B1;-amylase activity does not significantly affect starch content or grain yield.</title>
        <p>One of the most surprising results was the minimal effect on either the overall grain weight or the starch content of the A3OE grain. Although traces of degradation were clearly visible on the starch granules from mature grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), the efficiency of degradation was not as high as would be expected from such an increase of &#x3B1;-amylase. This apparent contradiction may be explained via several different mechanisms.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Our first hypothesis was that the absence of digestion, at least until the end of the starch-filling process, could be an indication of different localization between the engineered TaAMY3 enzyme and its substrates. During grain fill, starch in cereal grain is produced in amyloplasts. During maturation, the grain triggers a rapid net water loss and the membrane of the desiccated amyloplasts degrades (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Pepler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). If TaAMY3 is located outside of the plastid, the degradation of the granule could only occur when the lipid membrane surrounding the amyloplast breaks down.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">However, there are good reasons to believe that the over-expressed protein is in amyloplasts during development. Firstly, the <italic>TaAmy3</italic> sequence used for the construct shows the presence of a plastid targeting signal increasing the likelihood of an amyloplast localization of the engineered TaAMY3 protein during the grain development. The presence of the smaller form of TaAMY3 protein is consistent with cleavage of the transit peptide during passage across the amyloplast membrane (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Lao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and therefore an amyloplastic localization of the TaAMY3 protein during the starch-filling process. Sequence analysis using peptide prediction software ChloroP (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Emanuelsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) confirmed the size of the TaAMY3 transit peptide to be near 3kDa. The presence in mature grain of the TaAMY3 precursor form is probably due to a loss of amyloplast integrity, which would allow the non-cleaved protein access to starch granules. Secondly, the A3OE profiling during grain development showed an absence of elevated total &#x3B1;-amylase activity in crude extract from total grain despite an increase in TaAMY3 protein. This suggests that the lack of starch granule digestion during grain fill is due to &#x3B1;-amylase inactivation rather than physical separation. Purified amyloplasts during grain development would represent the ideal material to assess the localization of the A3OE protein within the endosperm and to identify the mechanism controlling amylase activity.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Another possible explanation is that the affinity for the TaAMY3 for the starch granule is relatively low. The specific location of the hydrolysis on the groove surrounding the granule suggests some limited entry point during the starch granule degradation. Amylases in general and &#x3B1;-amylases in particular show different affinity, mode of action, or efficiency depending on the presence, the amount, and the type of carbohydrate binding domain (CBM) or specific domain called the &#x201C;Sugar Tong&#x201D; (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Janecek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). For example, the AtAMY3 shows a unique and characteristic double CBM45, whereas the other known AMYs display a single CBM20 (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Glaring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">The final explanation for the lack of a major difference in the overall starch content would be the inhibition of all &#x3B1;-amylase activity including the over-expressed TaAMY3 during the grain filling process of the transgenic lines. Despite elevated <italic>TaAmy3</italic> transcript and higher protein content, the level of &#x3B1;-amylase activity in the A3OE lines was reduced to wild-type level during the grain-filling process, indicating translational and/or more likely post-translational regulation of activity. The regulation was reduced or removed during maturation, as &#x3B1;-amylase activity was increased in A3OE lines during that phase, despite protein levels being apparently reduced. Between the removal of inhibition and complete desiccation of the grain, there seems to be sufficient time to allow the partial degradation of starch granules seen in the SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), and increase in the soluble carbohydrate pool without significantly impacting overall starch content.</p>

        <title>Over-expression of TaAMY3 suggests post-transcriptional regulation during wheat grain filling</title>
        <p>The absence of transcript repression in our AMY3 A3OE and elevated protein in A3OE lines suggests the presence of inhibitors or post-transcriptional inhibition affecting the TaAMY3 during the carbohydrate accumulation process.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Alpha-amylase inhibitors have been described for many years and are exclusively located within the endosperm in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Buonocore <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>). However, they are not active against the endogenous &#x3B1;-amylase like the over-expressed TaAMY3 used in our transgenics.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Alpha-amylases have been shown to be potentially phosphorylated or redox-activated (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Glaring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Heazlewood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Seung <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> demonstrated light activation of AtAmy3 suggesting a major role of &#x3B1;-amylase in a stress-response mechanism. In addition, RNAi-mediated inactivation of thioredoxin showed clear reduction of starch-related enzyme activities, including &#x3B1;-amylase and &#x3B2;-amylase (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Light-induced activation in a non-photosynthetic tissue seems very unlikely. However, a potential effect of respiration change affecting redox statute of starch-related enzymes cannot be discounted. Respiratory changes in relation to endosperm starch synthesis have been described (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Emes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). This study suggested the presence of respiratory metabolism partitioning between protein and starch synthesis during endosperm development.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Recent work has highlighted the involvement of sucrose, via T6P, in a negative feedback loop of starch degradation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Martins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The model suggests that high levels of sucrose would increase T6P accumulation, which would then trigger a feedback mechanism that switches from starch catabolism to biosynthesis.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">High levels of sucrose in the mature grain could potentially trigger similar inhibitory effects during the early stage of the grain germination, explaining the observed delay in emergence of A3OE roots and coleorhizae. Seed-specific GWD RNAi in wheat showed a delay in germination associated with a significant increase of &#x3B1;-amylase (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Ral <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The similarity between the phenotype of the two transgenics suggests that delay could be due to the &#x3B1;-amylase increase, rather than a starch phosphate content alteration. Further characterization needs to be undertaken to identify the regulatory mechanism involved.</p>

        <title>Maintaining energy homeostasis at all costs</title>
        <p>The profiling of soluble carbohydrates present in the mature grain of A3OE lines showed a slight but significant increase in maltose along with a high level of glucose and sucrose. Although the excess of maltose and glucose are understandable as they are products of starch degradation by &#x3B1;-amylase (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), the very high level of sucrose in the mature grain is intriguing.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">The sucrose biosynthesis pathway has been well described in transitory starch metabolism (for review, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Koch, 2004</xref>). In aerial tissues, photosynthetic energy is initially captured as sucrose and excess is stored via starch accumulation. Starch is then mobilized at night, releasing maltose and glucose that can be exported and converted into sucrose, ensuring readily available energy for plant processes. Sucrose is also the major transport disaccharide and its role in regulation of plant development and physiology has been well described (for review <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wind <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">In the wheat grain, sucrose is mostly present at the early stage of grain development. During the grain-filling process, the conversion of sucrose from sink tissue into the precursor of starch synthesis, ADP&#x2013;glucose (ADP&#x2013;glc), ensures starch accumulation in the endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dale and Housley, 1986</xref>). High levels of sucrose in the A3OE mature grain suggest an additional mechanism converting the &#x3B1;-amylase degradation products (maltose then glucose) into sucrose during grain development. The role of sucrose in a regulatory mechanism for growing tissues and cell differentiation has been described in non-photosynthetic tissues (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Barajas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">In potato, high levels of sucrose have been shown to redox-activate the ADP&#x2013;glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) responsible for providing the unique precursor of starch biosynthesis, ADP&#x2013;glc (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Tiessen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In addition, sucrose, acting via T6P, has been identified as an inhibitor of the main regulator of the stress response and sugar signalling SNF1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In rice, &#x3B1;-amylase 3 has been characterised as a component of a sugar response complex including SnrK1 and a transcription factor MYBS1 (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, the mechanism through which sucrose is sensed and the components directly inhibiting or enabling starch degradation remain unknown.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">The presence of an elevated level of sucrose while not being the primary product of starch degradation by &#x3B1;-amylase suggests the presence in developing grain of a similar alternative pathway sensing and recycling degradation products into usable sugar ensuring energy homeostasis during grain development.</p>

Carbohydrates produced from starch breakdown could also be a substrate for oil production in the A3OE lines.
