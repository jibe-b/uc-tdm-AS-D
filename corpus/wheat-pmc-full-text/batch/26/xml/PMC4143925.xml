        <p>During meiosis, homologous chromosomes synapse and recombine at sites marked by the binding of the mismatch repair protein MLH1. In hexaploid wheat, the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus has a major effect on whether crossover occurs between homologues or between related homoeologues. Here we report that&#x2014;in wheat&#x2013;rye hybrids where homologues are absent&#x2014;<italic>Ph1</italic> affects neither the level of synapsis nor the number of MLH1. Thus in the case of wheat&#x2013;wild relative hybrids, <italic>Ph1</italic> must affect whether MLH1 sites are able to progress to crossover. The observed level of synapsis implies that <italic>Ph1</italic> functions to promote homologue pairing rather than suppress homoeologue pairing in wheat. Therefore, <italic>Ph1</italic> stabilises polyploidy in wheat by both promoting homologue pairing and preventing MLH1 sites from becoming crossovers on paired homoeologues during meiosis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are synapsed along their length by the loading of a proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex, between them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Within this framework, homologues can recombine. When the synaptonemal complex is degraded, crossovers (COs) or chiasmata enable the homologues to remain associated at metaphase I and so segregate properly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Two classes of COs coexist in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Class I gives rise to interfering COs and is thought to constitute the main pathway in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Class II results in non-interfering COs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Class I COs require MLH1, a DNA mismatch repair protein, part of the MutL complex, that is required for resolution of Double Holliday Junctions as COs, but not as non-crossovers (NCO). In all mammalian and diploid plant species so far studied, the presence of MLH1 sites on paired chromosomes at diplotene is the final marker for sites that will result in COs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>Despite possessing three related genomes (A, B and D), hexaploid wheat (2n=42) behaves as a diploid at meiosis. The major regulator of homoeologue pairing and recombination in wheat, the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, ensures that recombination is restricted to true homologues rather than homoeologues (equivalent chromosomes from other genomes)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. A number of studies have analysed <italic>Ph1</italic>&#x2019;s effect on chromosome organisation in premeiotic and early meiotic stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Here we study the dynamics of synapsis and the loading of the recombination machinery, and assess whether the formation and progression of these events are affected by the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>.</p>
    <sec disp-level="1">
      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>In wheat, whether the <italic>Ph1</italic> is present or not, the overall level of synapsis is similar; however, significant homoeologous synapsis occurs at late pachytene in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This synapsis may or may not result in chiasmata, as univalent, bivalents and multivalents are observed at metaphase I. The number of MLH1 sites on paired chromosomes during diplotene marks sites that will become interfering COs. It has been shown in wheat that the distribution and frequency of COs between homologues and homoeologues are similar in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), suggesting that this locus is affecting the major class I interfering pathway dependent on the MLH1 protein. Thus the number of MLH1 sites would be expected to depend on the presence or absence of <italic>Ph1.</italic> Wheat has normally at least one chiasma linking each of the arms of the 21 homologue pairs in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>. So about 42 MLH1 sites would be expected to be present in diplotene meiocytes. Consistent with this prediction, 48&#xB1;4 MLH1 sites are observed in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). When <italic>Ph1</italic> is absent, on average seven chromosome arms lacked chiasmata at metaphase I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Consequently, fewer MLH1 sites would be expected. However, surprisingly, the number of MLH1 sites is not decreased (52&#xB1;5 at diplotene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This indicates that in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, when both homologous and homoeologous synapsis occurs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the number of COs does not correspond with the number of MLH1 sites. The presence of slightly more MLH1 sites (48) than COs (42) may be because some of the MLH1 sites are on homoeologous chromosomes which would not progress to COs. The fact that we observe about 50 MLH1 sites in both the presence and absence of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus suggests some kind of homeostatic control to maintain CO number as has been reported in yeast, worms and mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
      <p>The effect of homoeologous synapsis on the number of MLH1 sites can be studied more directly in a situation where no homologous synapsis can occur. Wheat&#x2013;rye hybrids contain a haploid set of 21 wheat chromosomes and a haploid set of seven rye chromosomes, thus possessing 28 homoeologues but no homologues. Several studies have reported an average of less than one rod bivalent in these hybrids, implying one chiasma or less at metaphase I with <italic>Ph1</italic> present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, an average of 7.8 rod bivalents or more than 15 chromosome arms are linked by chiasmata in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Thus it would be reasonable to expect only one MLH1 site in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> but around 7 or 8 MLH1 sites in its absence. Again surprisingly, similar numbers of MLH1 sites are observed at diplotene whether in the presence or absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (19&#xB1;3 and 22&#xB1;3, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Therefore we can confirm that the number of MLH1 sites does not correlate directly with the number of COs when homoeologous synapsis occurs; only when homologues synapse.</p>
      <p>It is known that there are several fold more double-strand breaks generated at the start of meiosis, than are processed later into COs, and that there is a significant level of double-strand break repair using sister chromatids during meiosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In fact it has been reported that about a third of all double-strand breaks might be repaired using sister chromatids during meiosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although our results show more MLH1 sites than would be expected from the number of COs with <italic>Ph1</italic> either present or absent, if these MLH1 sites included sister chromatid repair sites, there would be substantially more than the number observed. Haploid <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> exhibits little synapsis and no chromosome fragmentation at metaphase I<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, implying that double-strand breaks have been repaired using sister chromatids. However there is only an average of one MLH1 site observed at diplotene in this haploid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, indicating that MLH1 is not marking the sites of sister chromatid repair. Therefore, although we do observe more MLH1 sites than COs, the vast majority of MLH1 sites in the wheat&#x2013;rye hybrid must mark Double Holliday Junctions between homoeologues that fail to be processed into COs after MLH1 loading, and then are processed into NCOs as the synaptonemal complex is degraded. Interestingly, deleting <italic>Ph1</italic> does alleviate to some extent the stalling of MLH1 sites, as seven to eight of these sites managed to progress further and crossover.</p>
      <p>Molecular analysis of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus revealed that it carries a cluster of defective kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>; and indeed, the closest homologue of the <italic>Ph1</italic> kinase in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also regulates pairing and recombination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Proteomic analysis showed that deletion of <italic>Ph1</italic> leads to increased phosphorylation at Cdk2-type sites during meiosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, which implies that the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> decreases Cdk2-type phosphorylation. Consistent with this, treatment with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatase activity, increases Cdk2-type phosphorylation, and phenocopies the deletion of <italic>Ph1</italic> by inducing COs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus deleting <italic>Ph1</italic> or treating with okadaic acid, both of which increase Cdk2-type activity, lead to an increased efficiency in processing of MLH1 sites on paired homoeologues into COs. Consistent with these observations, studies indicate that the MLH1 complex in mouse associates with Cdk2 on Double Holliday Junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and that there is a requirement for Cdk activity in the resolution of the junction between homologues as a CO in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p>
      <p>The level of homoeologue synapsis is reduced by the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However we have shown that there are similar numbers of MLH1 sites in either the presence or absence of <italic>Ph1.</italic> This implies that in the wheat&#x2013;rye hybrid, where only homoeologues are present, <italic>Ph1</italic> might not have a major effect on earlier meiotic pairing events as has been shown in wheat. To assess whether this is indeed the case, we used an antibody against RAD51, which marks sites of double-strand break formation, to assess the number of sites and their processing dynamics during earlier meiosis with and without <italic>Ph1</italic>. In both cases, the RAD51 sites are observed early in leptotene, increase during zygotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>) and disappear later in meiosis when Double Holliday Junctions are formed. The numbers of RAD51 sites observed in wheat&#x2013;rye meiocytes, along with their dynamics, are indeed similar in hybrids with and without <italic>Ph1</italic>.</p>
      <p>ASY1 is part of the lateral element of the synaptonemal complex around which each chromosome, comprising two sister chromatids, is organized; whereas the ZYP1 is part of the central region, which assembles between the lateral elements. The comparisons of the total lengths of the ZYP1-labelled elements with those of the ASY1, provides an indication of the level of synapsis achieved at pachytene when the synaptonemal complex is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The average total length of ASY1 elements traced at pachytene is 1,594&#xB1;540&#x2009;&#x3BC;m with <italic>Ph1</italic>, and 1,662&#xB1;535&#x2009;&#x3BC;m without <italic>Ph1</italic>; and for ZYP1 elements, 403&#xB1;89&#x2009;&#x3BC;m with <italic>Ph1</italic> and 378&#xB1;141&#x2009;&#x3BC;m without <italic>Ph1</italic>. The level of overall synapsis is 27%&#xB1;9 with <italic>Ph1</italic> and 26%&#xB1;15 without <italic>Ph1,</italic> indicating no significant difference. During this analysis, some synapsed bivalents could be traced almost in their entirety in the wheat&#x2013;rye hybrids. The level of synapsis, the occurrence of synapsed bivalents, the rye genome structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and the number of MLH1 sites are all consistent with reported preferential chiasma formation between the A and the D genomes in the wheat&#x2013;rye hybrid in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Potentially 14 of the 28 homoeologues could preferentially synapse with at least one MLH1 site per paired arm, resulting in a minimum of 14 MLH1 sites. Surprisingly, homoeologue synapsis is not reduced at pachytene in the hybrid, as it is in wheat itself, by the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The hybrid possesses just homoeologues, whereas wheat possesses both homologues and homoeologues. Suppression of homoeologue synapsis therefore requires the presence of both homologues as well as <italic>Ph1</italic>. This implies that <italic>Ph1</italic> promotes homologue pairing, rather than suppressing homoeologue pairing, as homoeologue pairing during pachytene occurs in the hybrid even in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>.</p>
      <p>The presence of homologues has been shown to trigger chromosome elongation events on both homologues as part of the initial pairing process in wheat and <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This elongation event is initiated in the telomere regions in wheat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. <italic>Ph1</italic> affects telomere dynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, as well as synchronization of the elongation events at the onset of meiosis. Cdk2 colocalizes with MLH1 on the paired chromosomes and to the telomere regions affecting their dynamics during mouse meiosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Therefore it is conceivable that the promotion of homologous synapsis in wheat by <italic>Ph1</italic> may simply be through a Cdk effect on the telomere regions. Thus <italic>Ph1</italic> stabilizes wheat as a polyploid during meiosis by both promoting homologue pairing in early meiosis and preventing MLH1 sites on paired homoeologues from becoming COs later in meiosis. In the case of wheat&#x2013;wild relative hybrids used by breeders to introduce important traits from relatives, <italic>Ph1</italic> suppresses recombination between homoeologues by just preventing the MLH1 sites becoming COs.</p>

        <title>Meiosis staging and polyacrylamide embedding of meiocytes</title>
        <p>Meiocytes of wheat and wheat&#x2013;rye hybrids were embedded in acrylamide to preserve their three-dimensional (3D) architecture. Embedding of meiocytes was based upon the method of Bass <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> Briefly, tillers were harvested when the flag leaf was starting to emerge (around 2&#x2009;cm). For each dissected floret, one of the three synchronized anthers was squashed in acetocarmine stain and examined under the light microscope to identify the appropriate stage of meiosis. The two remaining anthers were harvested into buffer A (15&#x2009;mM Pipes-NaOH pH 6.8, 80&#x2009;mM KCl, 20&#x2009;mM NaCl, 0.5&#x2009;mM EGTA, 2&#x2009;mM EDTA, 0.2&#x2009;mM spermine tetra HCl, 0.5&#x2009;mM spermidine, 1&#x2009;mM DTT, 0.32&#x2009;M sorbitol) and the anthers from several plants were pooled. Anthers were then fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15&#x2009;min and washed twice in buffer A for 10&#x2009;min. Anthers were macerated in buffer A and the meiocyte suspension was used to prepare the polyacrylamide pads. 10&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of the meiocyte suspension were transferred onto a coverslip (24 &#xD7; 24&#x2009;mm) followed by immediate addition of 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of activated acrylamide stock. The activated acrylamide stock was made by addition of 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of 20% ammonium persulphate and 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of 20% sodium sulphite to 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of acrylamide stock (50&#x2009;&#x3BC;l 2 &#xD7; buffer A, 50&#x2009;&#x3BC;l 30% 29:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide). The polymerising suspension was covered by another coverslip positioned with an overhang to allow easy removal after polymerisation. The coverslip was removed after 1&#x2009;h, leaving a thin pad of acrylamide with embedded meiocytes attached to the slide. All washing steps below consisted of placing 2&#x2009;ml on top of the face-up acrylamide placed in a petri dish (40 &#xD7; 40&#x2009;mm). Solutions were carefully removed by aspiration to avoid disturbing the acrylamide pads.</p>

        <p>The meiotic nuclei embedded in polyacrylamide were washed twice in buffer A for 10&#x2009;min to remove unpolymerized acrylamide, followed by 1-h wash in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% Triton X-100, 1&#x2009;mM EDTA pH 8 and 2-h incubation in blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1&#x2009;mM EDTA pH 8). Acrylamide pads were incubated with the appropriate antibodies diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer for 48&#x2009;h at 4&#x2009;&#xB0;C.

The pads were washed for 3&#x2009;h (6 &#xD7; 30&#x2009;min) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1&#x2009;mM EDTA pH 8 followed by a 15&#x2009;min wash in PBS. DAPI at 1&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> was applied on the pads for 3&#x2009;min and washed in PBS for 15&#x2009;min. The pads were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and left to cure for 2 or 3 days (to reach an optimum 1.47 refractive index) before being sealed with nail varnish.</p>

        <title>Image acquisition and analysis</title>
        <p>Nuclei were optically sectioned using a Leica TCS SP5II confocal laser scanning microscope controlled by Leica LAS-AF software. Z-stacks were deconvolved using AutoQuant X2 (Media Cybernetics). Projections and analysis of 3D pictures were performed using Fiji (an implementation of ImageJ, a public domain program by W. Rasband available from <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). More than 300 nuclei obtained from multiple wheat and wheat&#x2013;rye hybrid plants were scored by this method. Some of these nuclei were then selected for further analysis using Imaris 7.6.5 (Bitplane). Imaris allows the Z-stacks to be rendered in 3D; following this, the bivalents were traced by 3D modelling. The selection of MHL1 sites was performed automatically using the &#x2018;spot detection&#x2019; wizard in Imaris 7.6.5, and the results were subsequently manually edited to remove any sites that lay away from the nucleus or to add in sites that the automatic detection failed to select.</p>
