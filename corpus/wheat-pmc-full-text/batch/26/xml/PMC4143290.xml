      <abstract>
        <p>Hematopoiesis is a complex process that relies on various cell types, signaling pathways, transcription factors and a specific niche. The integration of these various components is of critical importance to normal blood development, as deregulation of these may lead to bone marrow failure or malignancy. <italic>Tle4</italic>, a transcriptional corepressor, acts as a tumor suppressor gene in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia, yet little is known about its function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis or in mammalian development. We report here that <italic>Tle4</italic> knockout mice are runted and die at around four weeks with defects in bone development and BM aplasia. By two weeks of age, <italic>Tle4</italic> knockout mice exhibit leukocytopenia, B cell lymphopenia, and significant reductions in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. <italic>Tle4</italic> deficient hematopoietic stem cells are intrinsically defective in B lymphopoiesis and exhaust upon stress, such as serial transplantation. In the absence of <italic>Tle4</italic> there is a profound decrease in bone mineralization. In addition, <italic>Tle4</italic> knockout stromal cells are defective at maintaining wild-type hematopoietic stem cell function <italic>in vitro</italic>. In summary, we illustrate a novel and essential role for <italic>Tle4</italic> in the extrinsic and intrinsic regulation of hematopoiesis and in bone development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The bone marrow (BM) is a heterotypic organ that dynamically integrates a variety of signals to modulate both quantitative and qualitative output of hematopoiesis to meet specific needs such as oxygen transport, immunity, and clotting. It is increasingly recognized that the differentiation of blood cells is affected not only by factors intrinsic to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) but also a variety of cell types in the HSPC niche, including endothelial cells, osteolineage cells, sympathetic neurons, Cxcl12-activated reticular (CAR) cells, and nestin expressing stromal cells <xref rid="pone.0105557-Nwajei1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Together, these external and internal regulators work in concert to dynamically respond to physiological demand.</p>
      <p>Genetic aberrations in these HSPC can lead to clonal expansions of progenitor cells as in leukemia. One such recurrent genetic mutation occurring in approximately 2% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is del(9q), which is enriched in patients with the t(8&#x2236;21) fusion protein <italic>AML1-ETO</italic><xref rid="pone.0105557-Grimwade1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Previously, we showed that loss of two genes, <italic>Tle1</italic> and <italic>Tle4</italic>, within the commonly deleted region of 9q can cooperate specifically with the <italic>AML1-ETO</italic> fusion product in a zebrafish model of myeloblastic expansion. Moreover, modulation of these genes in cell lines harboring t(8; 21) can influence the proliferative and apoptotic rate of these cells <xref rid="pone.0105557-Dayyani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Additionally, <italic>Tle1</italic> has been shown to be silenced by methylation in a broader set of AML samples, as well as in non-Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas <xref rid="pone.0105557-Fraga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The TLE family of genes is a group of highly conserved transcriptional corepressors. The TLE homologue in Drosophila, <italic>Groucho</italic> (Gro), plays a crucial role in multiple developmental processes including neurogenesis, segmentation, and sex determination <xref rid="pone.0105557-Paroush1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Gro also has instructive roles in many signaling pathways including receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/MAPK, Notch, Wingless (Wg)/Wnt, and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) <xref rid="pone.0105557-TurkiJudeh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Proteins in the <italic>TLE</italic> family can influence transcription by either direct binding to a variety of transcription factors essential to both hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, including members of the Hes, Runx, LEF1/Tcf, Pax, and Myc families, as well as recruitment of histone deacetylases and methylases, leading to chromatin silencing via condensation over large domains <xref rid="pone.0105557-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A combination of these effects likely underlies the ability of this protein family to influence cell fate and malignant transformation. Depending on context, these proteins may behave as either tumor suppressor genes or as facilitators of oncogenesis as in invasive breast cancer and synovial cell sarcoma, respectively <xref rid="pone.0105557-Brunquell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105557-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To better understand the role of <italic>Tle4</italic> in development and oncogenesis, we developed a <italic>Tle4</italic> knockout (KO) mouse. <italic>Tle4</italic> KO mice have significant postnatal growth abnormalities, including skeletal and hematological defects. By three weeks of age, KO mice are leukopenic and display specific deficiencies of B cells and HSPC. We show that these defects arise from a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic defects.</p>

        <title>Generation of <italic>Tle4</italic> null Mice</title>
        <p>A conditional <italic>Tle4</italic> null mouse was constructed by targeting LoxP sites to flank exon 2 via homologous recombination using the 129S6/SvEvTac ES cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Resultant mice were crossed with <italic>&#x3B2;-actin: Cre</italic> mice (gift of Susan Dymecki) to delete exon 2 in all tissues. Heterozygote mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 background for over 6 generations and interbred to generate <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice.</p>

            <p>(a) Targeting schema for generation of <italic>Tle4</italic> null animals. Conditional <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice were created by homologous recombination with an original construct containing a pgk-neo positive selection cassette and a Diptheria toxin (Dt) negative selection sequence, The pgk-neo selection cassette was excised between flanking Frt sites (white arrow head) by breeding mice to beta actin-Flp mice, leaving loxp sites flanking exon 2. These conditionally <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice were bred to beta-actin cre mice to generate <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice with a deleted exon 2 between flanking Loxp sites (black arrowheads). (b) RT-PCR showed exon 2 was cleanly excised. Loss of exon 2 creates a frameshift in the cDNA and a truncated non-functional Tle4 peptide. (c) Loss of Tle4 does not significantly affect the expression of other Tle family members as shown by RT-PCR of cDNA from the bone marrow of 2 week old mice. (d) Loss of Tle4 expression in <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice was demonstrated by Western blot with protein from brain and lung.</p>

        <p>To assess homing potential, total BM from three week old KO and WT littermates were pooled by genotype and stained with 1&#x2236;500 dilutions of DiD or DiI (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 1&#xD7;10<sup>7</sup> cells were injected into lethally irradiated WT CD45.1 expressing C57BL/6 mice. After 18 hours post-transplantation, total BM was isolated from recipient mice and analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The homing index was calculated as a quotient of the Input Ratio (%KO/%WT) over the Recovered Ratio (%KO/%WT), as described previously <xref rid="pone.0105557-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>

This was confirmed by TUNEL staining of paraffin-embedded humeri harvested from two-week old WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g008">Figure 8c</xref>). Compared to WT, various compartments of KO bone exhibited increased TUNEL staining, including the periosteal cells lining lacunae in the epiphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g008">Figure 8c</xref>, panel C vs H) and periosteal cells under the cortex of the diaphyseal portion of the humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g008">Figure 8c</xref>, panel D vs I). Moreover, TUNEL staining was more extensively pervasive throughout trabeculae and bone marrow in KO compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g008">Figure 8c</xref>, panel B vs G, E vs J). This further suggested the possibility that the hematopoietic abnormalities seen in KO mice might be at least in part due to the absence of support from the osteoblastic niche.</p>
        <p>To further elucidate whether impaired HSC maintenance by KO BM was dependent on stromal cell irregularities, western blots using whole bone lysates from two week old WT and KO mouse were performed using antibodies against <italic>Scf</italic>, a known factor involved in the maintenance of HSC <xref rid="pone.0105557-Nwajei1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0105557-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Though some KO mice displayed a complete lack of Scf expression, others showed modest protein levels (results not shown). The considerable animal to animal variation suggests that down-regulation of <italic>Scf</italic> expression is not a direct effect of Tle4 loss, but might reflect a loss of an <italic>Scf</italic> producing cell type in <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice. Other factors may account for the impairment of HSC maintenance.</p>
        <p>Since <italic>Tle4</italic> null animals do not survive long enough to serve as bone marrow recipients of wild-type HSPC, we adapted a co-culturing assay to determine whether HSC-extrinsic factors may have influenced the observed hematological phenotype <xref rid="pone.0105557-Mukherjee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Wild-type LKS cells from two week old mice were co-cultured on WT or KO stroma cells derived from 3 day old mice for two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g009">Figure 9a</xref>). Non-adherent cells were harvested and analyzed for expression of c-Kit and Sca-1. In WT co-cultures, 6&#x2013;15% of recovered cells were positive for both markers. In stark contrast, less than 1% of cells recovered from WT LKS cells plated on KO stromal co-cultures were C-kit<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g009">Figure 9b</xref>). Long-term co-culture experiments plated in methylcellulose revealed an even more pronounced effect. Cells recovered from WT co-cultures exhibited an average of 10-fold more colonies than their KO counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g009">Figure 9c</xref>). Some KO co-cultures failed to exhibit any colony forming ability. Thus, <italic>Tle4</italic> null stromal cells cannot maintain and support HSPC growth as efficiently as WT stromal cells.</p>

        <title><italic>Tle4</italic> null HSPC are intrinsically impaired in B cell differentiation and exhaust after serial transplantation</title>
        <p>Due to the progressive leukopenia in primary <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice and the extrinsic effects noted above, we tested the colony-forming ability of sorted LKS cells from 2 week old WT or <italic>TLE4</italic> null mice.

After 13 days in methylcellulose culture, sorted LKS cells from KO were less efficient in forming CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM compared to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g010">Figure 10b</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further test this effect, we performed <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic> transplantation assays using BM from 2 week old animal or fetal liver hematopoietic cells to determine whether loss of <italic>Tle4</italic> intrinsically affected HSC self-renewal and repopulation efficiency. Whole BM from two-week-old CD45.2<sup>+</sup> KO and WT animals was isolated and transplanted into lethally irradiated allogeneic WT mice expressing CD45.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11a</xref>). Given our observation of non-significant differences in LKS SLAM populations, representing long-term HSC, between WT and KO BM, equal numbers of cells from donor KO and WT BM were transplanted into recipient mice. Sixteen weeks after BM transplant (BMT), recipients of KO and WT BM showed non-significant differences in donor chimerism in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11b</xref>). However, FACS analysis of peripheral blood showed that recipient mice of KO BM had significant reductions in the frequency of B cells, with concomitant increases in both T and myeloid cell frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11b</xref>). At 32 weeks after transplant, CBC analysis of KO BM recipients demonstrated the development of significant leukopenia, especially a decrease in myeloid and lymphoid lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11c, left panel</xref>). Immunophenotypic analysis showed that the leukopenia was mostly due to a decreased frequency of B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11c, right panel</xref>). Fractionation of B cell precursors in recipients 32 weeks post-transplant showed a reduction in the absolute number of Fraction D and E cells and an increase in Fraction C before progression to fraction D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11d</xref>). This suggests that transplanted <italic>Tle4</italic> null BM cells have a block in B cell development at the late pro-B to pre-B-cell stage, more restricted than seen in situ with Tle4 null mice, but still distinct from the early pro-B to late pro-B block reported with <italic>Pax5</italic> deficiency <xref rid="pone.0105557-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105557-Nutt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105557-Milili1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Analysis of HSPC in recipients 32 weeks after transplant, which has been shown to reflect long term repopulating activity of HSC [32], revealed no significant differences between KO and WT recipients in the absolute number of LKS, CLP, CMP, or GMP compartments. However, MEPs were significantly reduced in KO recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11e</xref>). A competitive homing experiment revealed that at 18 hours after transplant, KO HSC were able to home to the recipient niche as efficiently as WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11f</xref>), indicating the observed abnormalities were not due to homing defects of these cells. These findings suggest that BMT with <italic>Tle4</italic> null HSC results in leukopenia, specifically B lymphopenia arising from partial blocks in ProB development. However, KO donor BM retained normal frequencies of most HSPC fractions after transplantation into a normal BM niche.</p>
        <p>To test self-renewal capacity of KO versus WT HSC while excluding confounding effects possibly due to prior exposure to a defective <italic>Tle4</italic> null BM niche, we performed serial transplantations of fetal liver hematopoietic cells (FL) of E13.5 WT and KO CD45.2<sup>+</sup> fetuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12a</xref>). Recipients of KO and WT FL primary transplants exhibited peripheral leukopenia and specific B cell lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g007">Figure 7b</xref>, left and middle panels), recapitulating the phenotype observed in recipients of KO BM in prior BMT experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g011">Figure 11c and 11d</xref>). Additionally, there were no differences in the frequency of HSC between primary recipients of KO or WT FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12b</xref>, right). Upon serial transplantation of FL into secondary transplant recipients, we again saw highly significant leukopenia and lymphopenia 16 weeks after transplant in KO recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12c</xref>, left). Interestingly, secondary KO FL recipients also exhibited a significant reduction in <italic>Tle4</italic> null-derived LKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12c</xref>, right). Moreover, these LKS cells present at secondary transplant had high expression of CD34, with few CD34<sup>&#x2212;</sup> LKS cells, while WT recipients had relatively equal numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>&#x2212;</sup> LKS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12c</xref>, right). Sixteen weeks after tertiary transplant, total peripheral blood leukocytes decreased five fold with an even more significant reduction in the frequency of B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12d</xref>). Additionally, there was a striking reduction and, in some KO FL recipients, a complete absence, of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> LKS cells, CD34<sup>&#x2212;</sup> LKS cells, and LKS CD34<sup>&#x2212;</sup> SLAM long term HSC at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105557-g012">Figure 12e</xref>). These serial transplantation experiments suggest that the absence of Tle4 leads to reduced self-renewal of HSC.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In Drosophila, <italic>Groucho</italic> is a master transcriptional regulator expressed ubiquitously throughout development and influences multiple key developmental processes <xref rid="pone.0105557-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The precise roles of the various TLE homologues in vertebrates are not very well understood. To characterize those functions specific to <italic>Tle4</italic>, we developed a novel <italic>Tle4</italic> null mouse model. Our studies have identified the critical importance of <italic>Tle4</italic> in bone calcification, bone marrow niche formation, BM cellularity, B cell development, HSPC self-renewal capacity, and thymic and splenic architecture.</p>
      <p>One of the striking abnormalities in these KO mice is a decreased calcification of the skeleton. This impaired ossification is apparent in both membranous bone (flat skull bones) as well as endochondral bones (long bones) by birth. The phenotype of impaired mineralization and abnormal growth plates in <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice is similar to that reported in mice lacking <italic>Grg/Aes</italic>, a truncated member of the Groucho/TLE gene family <xref rid="pone.0105557-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, the defects in <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice are more profound and worsen with age instead of phenotypic recovery seen in <italic>Grg5</italic> null mice. Given the reported function of <italic>Grg5</italic> as a dominant negative inhibitor of Tle proteins, it might be surprising to see a similar phenotype between loss of <italic>Grg5</italic> and <italic>Tle4</italic>, however, this dominant negative effect is only demonstrated in some over-expression or mis-expression studies and evidence points to other roles for <italic>Grg5</italic> independent of its ability to inhibit the Tles, and in some contexts has similar repressive functions as the Tles <xref rid="pone.0105557-Beagle1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The Groucho/TLE proteins are capable of interacting with multiple signaling pathways and may alter the function of key proteins important for bone formation, including Runx2/Cbfa1, a critical regulator of bone development and maturation <xref rid="pone.0105557-McLarren1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105557-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The apparent resorption of trabeculae seen in 4 week old mice under the growth plate suggests additional abnormalities in addition to bone formation. Further investigations are underway to better characterize the nature of this defect in bone development and maintenance.</p>
      <p>Several reports have described the role of the BM microenvironment on hematopoiesis <xref rid="pone.0105557-Calvi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105557-Asada1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Osteoblasts have a well-defined role in supporting B lymphopoiesis via expression of the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit G(s)alpha <xref rid="pone.0105557-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105557-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. While we have not yet determined whether osteoblasts are specifically affected in our model <italic>per se</italic>, it is reasonable to assume that the compromise of trabecular bone is at least contributory to the observed B cell and HSPC defects. The inability of <italic>Tle4</italic> null stromal cells cultured <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> to maintain WT HSC suggests that the hematopoietic phenotype seen in KO mice may derive in part from niche-induced deregulation. Furthermore, as evidenced by TUNEL staining of bones harvested from WT and KO mice, it is clear that the absence of <italic>Tle4</italic> has an effect on the viability and integrity of the BM niche and stroma, Further experiments are needed to better characterize the nature of this defective stromal support of HSPC.</p>
      <p>Loss of <italic>Tle4</italic> appears to significantly impair LSK differentiation into granulocyte, monocyte, macrophage progenitors and LSK self-renewal, at least in part due to increased cellular apoptosis. The finding of preserved numbers of long term stem cells as marked by CD34+ LSK CD48&#x2212; CD150+ in two week old <italic>Tle4</italic> knockout mice, despite decreases in more mature lineages, further studies are need to understand the mechanisms of this preservation.</p>
      <p>Concurrently, BM and fetal liver serial transplantation experiments demonstrate a robust HSPC-intrinsic effect of <italic>Tle4</italic> deletion. In both transplant models, mice receiving KO HSPC develop peripheral leukopenia. Moreover, this finding in FL serial transplantation illustrates the potential HSPC-intrinsic defects of Tle4 loss leading to decreased capacity of HSPC self-renewal. Additionally, our study provides the first direct <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic> evidence of a role of Tle4 on B-cell development, an effect previously inferred based on interactions of Tle4 and Pax5 <xref rid="pone.0105557-Eberhard1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0105557-Linderson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The somewhat distinct block in B-cell differentiation seen with Tle4 loss compared to that reported with Pax5 loss suggests Tle4 may exert some B-cell effects independent from Pax5, although we can&#x2019;t exclude potential animal models differences as accounting for this effect. Taken together, our data demonstrates the critical importance of <italic>Tle4</italic> in regulating various developmental processes central to bone maturation, medullary hematopoiesis, and HSPC maintenance. These findings may have significant implications for understanding hematopoiesis in both normal and disease states. Moreover, our observations provide further insight and affirmation to previous findings that implicate <italic>Tle4</italic> as a critical regulator of leukemia and other states of hematological dysregulation.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In summary, by the development of the first model for <italic>Tle4</italic> deletion in mammals, our data provide evidence for an essential role for <italic>Tle4</italic> in mammalian bone and blood development. <italic>Tle4</italic> deficient B cells exhibit intrinsic developmental defects and HSC exhibit stem cell depletion after serial transplantation. <italic>Tle4</italic> null bone marrow stromal cells fail to support hematopoiesis <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic>, suggesting a potentially novel extrinsic role of <italic>Tle4</italic> in the regulation of hematopoiesis. <italic>Tle4</italic> null mice have profound defects in bone mineralization and growth plate organization, which apparently affects skeletal growth.</p>
      <p>Our work has shed light on a novel regulatory function for this corepressor in normal hematopoiesis and bone development. As such, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms controlled by <italic>Tle4</italic> offers a significant challenge and opportunity for expanding our understanding of bone development and the multicellular orchestration of hematopoiesis. This work further potentially offers novel insight into the transcriptional processes underlying malignant transformation.</p>
