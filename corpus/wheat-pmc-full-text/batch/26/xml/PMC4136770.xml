      <abstract>
        <p>The production of ethanol from pretreated plant biomass during fermentation is a strategy to mitigate climate change by substituting fossil fuels. However, biomass conversion is mainly limited by the recalcitrant nature of the plant cell wall. To overcome recalcitrance, the optimization of the plant cell wall for subsequent processing is a promising approach. Based on their phylogenetic proximity to existing and emerging energy crops, model plants have been proposed to study bioenergy-related cell wall biochemistry. One example is <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, which has been considered as a general model plant for cell wall analysis in grasses. To test whether relative phylogenetic proximity would be sufficient to qualify as a model plant not only for cell wall composition but also for the complete process leading to bioethanol production, we compared the processing of leaf and stem biomass from the C<sub>3</sub> grasses <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (wheat) with the C<sub>4</sub> grasses <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize) and <italic>Miscanthus</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic>, a perennial energy crop. Lambda scanning with a confocal laser-scanning microscope allowed a rapid qualitative analysis of biomass saccharification. A maximum of 108&#x2013;117 mg ethanol&#xB7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> dry biomass was yielded from thermo-chemically and enzymatically pretreated stem biomass of the tested plant species. Principal component analysis revealed that a relatively strong correlation between similarities in lignocellulosic ethanol production and phylogenetic relation was only given for stem and leaf biomass of the two tested C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Our results suggest that suitability of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> as a model plant for biomass conversion of energy crops has to be specifically tested based on applied processing parameters and biomass tissue type.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The increasing global energy demand leads to an elevated consumption of fossil energy resources, which is not only associated with the observed climate change <xref rid="pone.0103580-Ash1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> but also a with a growing threat for sensitive ecosystems due to expanded explorations for fossil energy sources <xref rid="pone.0103580-Finer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-Sojinu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. One strategy to face this challenge is the substitution of fossil by renewable energy sources. In the sector of transportation, liquid fossil fuels have a predominant role. Here, second generation biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstock have the potential for an extended substitution in the near future <xref rid="pone.0103580-Sims1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A main source of lignocellulosic feedstock could be stover and straw from field crops, which would mainly derive from <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize) and <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (wheat) in temperate climates, where these two crops are predominantly cultivated in agriculture according to the 2012 FAO statistics of crop production <xref rid="pone.0103580-FAOSTAT1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, to meet the expected demand on lignocellulosic feedstock and to improve a sustainable production of biomass, an extended cultivation of energy crops is a promising solution <xref rid="pone.0103580-Somerville1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In terms of sustainability, perennial C<sub>4</sub> grasses are preferred low-input energy crops because they can recycle their nutrients and store them in their rhizomes in the non-growing season, which results in a minimized fertilizer input. In addition, they have a reduced requirement for herbicide application because of fast growth, providing habitats for animals, and reducing soil erosion with their extended, permanent root systems <xref rid="pone.0103580-Beale1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Among the group of perennial C<sub>4</sub> grasses, <italic>Miscanthus</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> not only meets the mentioned criteria for sustainable biomass production <xref rid="pone.0103580-vanderWeijde1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> but also proved to be the most productive energy crop under temperate climate conditions <xref rid="pone.0103580-Dohleman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-vanHulle1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Hence, the calculated lignocellulosic ethanol yield per ha cropland for <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> was higher than in other designated energy crops including <italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>Panicum virgatum</italic> (switchgrass) <xref rid="pone.0103580-Heaton1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, the efficiency of lignocellulosic ethanol production is restricted by the recalcitrance of the cell wall, which results in a relatively low saccharification. Main factors that determine biomass saccharification are cellulose crystallinity <xref rid="pone.0103580-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-Puri1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> but also lignin and hemicellulose content <xref rid="pone.0103580-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103580-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Apart from modifying and adapting different biomass pretreatment methods, the optimization of the cell wall for improved saccharification is a strategy to overcome biomass recalcitrance. Whereas different genetic tools and their application have already been established for major crops like <italic>T. aestivum</italic> and <italic>Z.mays</italic>, none of these tools are available for <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic>. Therefore, the wild grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> with its relatively small and sequenced diploid genome, efficient transformation, easy cultivation, and fast generation cycle has been proposed as a suitable model to test modified or engineered cell walls for altered saccharification. However, whereas genomic and cell wall composition studies already revealed the suitability of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> as a model for other grasses <xref rid="pone.0103580-Alves1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, comparative analyses of the complete process starting from biomass pretreatment via saccharification efficiency to fermentation leading to ethanol production have not been performed.</p>
      <p>Our study aimed to test whether phylogenetic relation could be used as a marker for similarities in the processing of biomass for ethanol production with a special focus on <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and its qualities as a model plant for energy crops regarding ethanol production via fermentation. In case phylogenetic proximity would correlate with the process of biomass fermentation, we expected that results from <italic>B. distachyon</italic> would reveal highest similarity to <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, which are both C<sub>3</sub> grasses, and not to the C<sub>4</sub> grasses <italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic>. We distinguished between leaf and stem biomass because we identified a specific requirement to establish a model plant for stem biomass. In general, biomass from perennial grasses like <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> mainly derives from stems because it is typically harvested in early spring when most leaves have fallen off and the water content is low. We cultivated all plants and performed all experiments under the same conditions to ensure that observed differences or similarities would not be based on the experimental setup but on cell wall characteristics.</p>
      <p>Our results revealed that phylogenetic relation cannot be regarded as a general marker for similarities in the processing of biomass for bioethanol production because other factors like biomass pretreatment as well as tissue type of the biomass seem to have an additional influence.</p>

Therefore, these differences in cellulose and hemicellulose content were the first indication that a phylogenetic relation might not directly refer to relatively high similarities in cell wall composition.

The combination of a thermo-chemical pretreatment using diluted acid with a subsequent enzyme application is regarded as one of the most promising strategies to overcome biomass recalcitrance and release of fermentable carbohydrates <xref rid="pone.0103580-Pu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the leaf biomass of all analyzed plant species, we observed a shift in the glucose to xylose mol%-ratio from 1/7 before treatment to nearly 1/1 ratio after sulfuric acid and combined sulfuric acid and enzymatic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), which was even stronger for <italic>B. distachyon</italic> leaf biomass after the combined pretreatment. Here, the glucose to xylose mol%-ratio shifted to almost 2/1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). For stem biomass, we observed a similar increased recalcitrance of glucose-containing hemicelluloses compared to xylose-containing, which was again most prominent for <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, where the glucose to xylose mol %-ratio shifted from about 1/7 before treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) to 1/1 after sulfuric acid pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and to almost 2/1 after combined acid and enzyme pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In addition to the differences in the non-cellulosic monosaccharide composition observed for <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, we found additional significant differences especially for the arabinose content of <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> leaf and stem biomass, which was highest after both, sulfuric acid and combined sulfuric acid and enzymatic treatment compared to the other plant species, and for <italic>Z. mays</italic> stem biomass where the galacturonic acid content was highest after the two types of biomass treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g003">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). These results revealed that the applied pretreatment methods favored the release of xylose rather than glucose from hemicelluloses. Our results confirmed previous studies where xylan, the main hemicellulose and main source of xylose, was better hydrolyzed during thermo-chemical biomass pretreatment than glucomannan, which mainly consists of glucose residues <xref rid="pone.0103580-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-Marzialetti1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

        <title>Rapid qualitative analysis of biomass saccharification by confocal lambda scanning</title>
        <p>To test the application of a rapid qualitative analysis of biomass composition and saccharification after different methods of biomass pretreatment, we applied a lambda scan via confocal laser-scanning microscopy to the different tissue types of biomass deriving from all four analyzed plant species. The qualitative mapping of the plant cell walls is based on its auto-fluorescence during lambda scanning. The excitation of the plant biomass with the 405 nm diode laser induced the emission of green fluorescence, which mainly derives from bound ferulic acid in cell walls <xref rid="pone.0103580-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103580-Fincher1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and carbohydrates; especially from cellulose <xref rid="pone.0103580-Phlker1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103580-Roshchina1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> as the most abundant polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). In this regard, a decrease in green fluorescence during pretreatment procedures as well as subsequent fermentation would not only indicate the hydrolysis of cellulose but also a reduction of cross-linked polysaccharides. The interdependency of these two processes is reflected by the fact that ester-linked ferulic acids at arabinose side chains of arabinoxylan are involved in the cross-linking of these cell wall polysaccharides and in forming ferulate-polysaccharide-lignin complexes that support cell wall cross-linking <xref rid="pone.0103580-deOBuanafina1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Therefore, the emitted green fluorescence can be seen as a marker for the recalcitrance of cell wall material to saccharification <xref rid="pone.0103580-Himmel1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. The parallel excitation of the plant cell wall material with 561 nm DPSS laser induced the emission of red-shifted fluorescence from <italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl, guiacyl, and syringyl families of lignins with an accumulated wavelength of about 600 nm <xref rid="pone.0103580-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Manual selection of regions used for spectral analysis facilitated a precise identification of cell wall parts in the heterogeneous cell wall suspension, which minimized the interference of the measurement by background auto-fluorescence of the fermentation broth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected from biomass without pretreatment, the leaf and stem cell walls of all plant species revealed a strong green auto-fluorescence peaking at about 500 nm, which indicated a relatively high content of cellulose and other carbohydrates as well as ferulic acid in cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The absolute strength of the green fluorescence overlaid the red fluorescence deriving from excited lignin, which was detected in parallel and indicated by a small shoulder formation at 600 nm mainly visible in leaf biomass samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). After thermo-chemical pretreatment with diluted sulfuric acid, the predominant auto-fluorescence of the leaf cell walls from <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, and <italic>Z. mays</italic> as well as <italic>T. aestivum</italic> stem cell walls was still green and peaked at about 500 nm. Hence, the efficiency of saccharification of this biomass was slightly lower compared to stem cell walls from <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, <italic>Z. mays</italic>, and especially <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic>, where also leaf cell walls revealed a second peak at about 600 nm after spectral analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This peak revealed a higher relative content of lignin due to hydrolysis of carbohydrates. Interestingly, the recalcitrance of leaf biomass was slightly higher than of stem biomass after thermo-chemical pretreatment. Based on previous reports <xref rid="pone.0103580-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103580-Jung3" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, we expected a higher recalcitrance of stem biomass, which would be mainly caused by a higher lignin content of stem biomass compared to leaf biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Therefore, other factors that determine biomass recalcitrance have to be considered. In this regard, the slightly higher hemicellulose content of leaf biomass samples than of stem biomass samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) might be involved as the content of hemicellulose affects cell wall digestibility due to a putatively higher cross-linking <xref rid="pone.0103580-deOBuanafina1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The combined biomass pretreatment with an initial diluted sulfuric acid and a subsequent enzymatic application resulted in a clearly improved saccharification of the cell walls. Auto-fluorescence from lignin components peaked at about 600 nm for almost all cell wall samples except the leaf and stem samples from <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and the stem samples from <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, where a second, weaker but distinct 500 nm peak was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), which indicated a relatively high carbohydrate content of the cell walls. Whereas increased recalcitrance of <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> biomass correlated with a relatively high lignin content in leaf and stem samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), we could not attribute a high lignin content to the relatively high recalcitrance of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> stem biomass because it was lowest in this measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Also the hemicellulose content, which can affect cell wall digestibility <xref rid="pone.0103580-deOBuanafina1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, was not significantly different from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> or <italic>Z. mays</italic> stem biomass that did not reveal an increased recalcitrance. This may indicate that cellulose crystallinity and/or ferulic acid-mediated cross-linking could be altered in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> stem cell walls. To analyze whether the observed recalcitrance of the leaf and stem cell walls from <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and the stem cell walls from <italic>B. distachyon</italic> would be conserved during fermentation, we performed a lambda scan of sulfuric acid and enzymatic pretreated cell walls 72 h after start of fermentation. Whereas the degree of saccharification for the <italic>B. distachyon</italic> stem sample was comparable to the <italic>B. distachyon</italic> leaf sample and all <italic>T. aestivum</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic> samples, the <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> samples were more recalcitrant to carbohydrate hydrolysis compared to all other samples because spectral analysis still revealed a relatively strong 500 nm peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In general, the effectiveness of saccharification is not only dependent on the lignin content of the biomass but also on the level of hemicelluloses and cellulose. Comparing the cellulose und hemicelluloses level in our study with those reported by Xu et. al. <xref rid="pone.0103580-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, the dried <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> biomass that we used in this study revealed most similarities to those <italic>Miscanthus</italic> accessions that gave the lowest total sugar yield after diluted sulfuric acid biomass pretreatment with subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. This might explain the relatively high degree of recalcitrance of <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> cell walls as indicated by the relatively strong emission of green fluorescence in confocal lambda scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Determination of glucose content and ethanol production during fermentation</title>
        <p>The quantification of the glucose content via HPLC in the pre-fermentation broth after biomass pretreatment resembled the observations that we previously made during lambda scanning. The degree of saccharification, which was indicated by a shift of the cell wall's auto-fluorescence from green to red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g006">6</xref>), correlated with the amount of released glucose; a low efficiency of saccharification and a low amount of released glucose after diluted sulfuric acid pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">7A</xref>), and an efficient saccharification with a high glucose concentration of the pre-fermentation broth after combined sulfuric acid and enzymatic biomass pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">7C</xref>). We also observed a correlation between the results of the spectral cell wall analysis and the HPLC analysis of glucose deriving from biomass that was only pretreated with diluted sulfuric acid. Those samples that showed the strongest shift of the auto-fluorescence spectrum from green to red also revealed the highest amount of released glucose. This was most prominent for stem biomass where <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic> showed the most distinct green to red shift in the spectral cell wall analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), which resembled the three-fold and two-fold higher amount of hydrolyzed glucose compared to <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and <italic>T. aestivum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s002">Tab. S1</xref>). Consequently, we detected a three-fold higher ethanol production for <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and a two-fold higher ethanol production for <italic>Z. mays</italic> stem biomass compared to <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and <italic>T. aestivum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s002">Tab. S1</xref>). Unlike stem biomass after diluted sulfuric acid treatment, we detected glucose in supernatants of the fermentation broth from leaf biomass even 48 h and 72 h after the start of fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). This indicated that the fermentation could be inhibited by compounds or cell wall components that might be only found in the leaf but not the stem where we did not detected an increased inhibition of fermentation. In general, furans formed by carbohydrate hydrolysis and phenolic monomers, which derive from lignin degradation, are known inhibitors of biomass fermentation with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0103580-Klinke1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Apart from biochemical approaches to reduce fermentation inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0103580-Weil1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> or the generation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains with improved resistance to inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0103580-Larsson1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, different process technologies like continuous fermentation have been discussed to reduce the problem of inhibition <xref rid="pone.0103580-Palmqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. The increase in the released glucose amount of sulfuric acid pretreated leaf biomass from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> between 0 h and 48 h after the start of fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) could indicate an ongoing saccharification process. Under these pretreatment conditions, the stem biomass of the C<sub>4</sub> grasses <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic> revealed the best ethanol production performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), which was mainly based in relatively high glucose yield of 11% and 8% of the total biomass, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s002">Tab. S1</xref>). The differences in saccharification efficiency and ethanol production, which we observed with biomass that was only pretreated with diluted sulfuric acid, were almost equalized when an additional enzymatic pretreatment followed the initial acid pretreatment. On average, results from leaf biomass revealed a four- to seven fold higher biomass to glucose conversion efficiency due to enzymatic hydrolysis for the C<sub>3</sub> grasses and a three- to five-fold higher conversion efficiency for the C<sub>4</sub> grasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s002">Tab. S1</xref>). The increased amount of produced ethanol (three-fold for <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, ten-fold for <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, and almost six-fold for <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic>) resembled the improved saccharification efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s002">Tab. S1</xref>). Interestingly, we did not detect glucose in the supernatant of the fermentation broth from leaf biomass with combined acid and enzymatic pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>) as we did after single acid treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). This not only indicated a more efficient hexose release due to the pretreatment before fermentation but probably also less putative fermentation inhibitors. Hence, a comparative compound analysis of the differentially pretreated leaf biomass might support the identification of fermentation inhibitors, especially from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> leaf biomass, where our data suggest a higher level of inhibitors than in the other three plant species. Our observation that the enzyme mixture may reduce the concentration of putative fermentation inhibitors would support their identification. Putative fermentation inhibitors might be tested for the susceptibility to degradation by the enzyme mixture used for saccharification. Comparing leaf and stem biomass after combined acid and enzymatic pretreatment, we did not determine major differences in saccharification or ethanol production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7C,D</xref>). Within stem biomass samples, only <italic>B. distachyon</italic> stem biomass showed an increased amount of released glucose, which was significantly higher than in <italic>Z. mays</italic>, but did not result in a significantly higher ethanol production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). The amounts of produced ethanol from <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> of 105&#x2013;110 mg&#xB7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> dry biomass that we determined for diluted acid and enzymatically pretreated biomass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103580.s002">Tab.

For <italic>Z. mays</italic> biomass, our ethanol yields after diluted acid and enzymatic pretreatment of 106&#x2013;109 mg ethanol&#xB7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> dry biomass outcompeted the ethanol yields of 20&#x2013;100 mg&#xB7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> dry biomass as reported in previous studies with alternative pretreatment methods <xref rid="pone.0103580-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0103580-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Only for <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, we yielded less ethanol than in a comparable study with a dilute acid and enzymatic pretreatment <xref rid="pone.0103580-Saha1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The higher ethanol yield in that study could be explained by the usage of a recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain and overliming of the biomass hydrolyzates, which seems to be more effective in <italic>T. aestivum</italic> biomass fermentation than the usage of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> without overliming.</p>

        <title>Principal component analysis</title>
        <p>To evaluate and summarize the potential of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> as model plant for the production of ethanol by fermentation of senesced and dried leaf and stem biomass, we performed separated two-factored principal component analyses (PCA) of stem and leaf biomass with a thermo-chemical diluted sulfuric acid pretreatment and the combined pretreatment with diluted sulfuric acid followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. The calculation of the PCA and factor analysis was based on six different parameters that comprised cell wall composition, saccharification efficiency, and ethanol production from pretreated biomass of <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic>, and <italic>Z. mays</italic>. A parallel analysis of multiple parameters would allow a more precise prediction of possible similarities than an evaluation of a single parameter or simple combinations as shown in <italic>Z. mays</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0103580-Jung4" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. The PCA revealed that <italic>B. distachyon</italic> is most suitable as model for the process of lignocellulosic ethanol production from stem biomass of the tested <italic>T. aestivum</italic> line after thermo-chemical biomass pretreatment. Previously, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> was also described as a suitable model to study modifications of arabinoxylan structure and biosynthesis that could be applied on monocot energy crops for saccharification improvements <xref rid="pone.0103580-Kulkami1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. However, based on our PCA results, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> would neither qualify as a good model for the process of lignocellulosic ethanol production from stem biomass of the tested crop lines after combined thermo-chemical and enzymatic biomass pretreatment nor as a good model for lignocellulosic ethanol production from leaf biomass independent of the applied method for biomass pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). A constant, direct correlation between phylogenetic relation and similarity in lignocellulosic ethanol production was only found for the C<sub>4</sub> grasses <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic>, which was independent of the applied biomass pretreatment method and type of biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast to its phylogenetic relation, <italic>T. aestivum</italic> revealed a higher similarity in lignocellulosic ethanol production to the C<sub>4</sub> grasses <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic> than to the C<sub>3</sub> model grass <italic>B. distachyon</italic> especially in the two scenarios with a combined thermo-chemical and enzymatic biomass pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). This may reflect previous observations where even within a plant species, <italic>Z. mays</italic>, strong differences in cell wall composition and saccharification were reported from different cultivars <xref rid="pone.0103580-Mchin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Therefore, it has to be generally considered that phylogenetic relation of plant species does not directly indicate a good suitability as model for lignocellulosic ethanol production. The PCA analysis also showed that the degree of similarity in lignocellulosic ethanol production can be altered by the application of different biomass pretreatment methods. This was most obvious for stem biomass of <italic>T. aestivum</italic> where the combined acidic and enzymatic pretreatment increased similarity in ethanol production to <italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic> but broke the relatively high similarity to <italic>B. distachyon</italic> compared to a single acidic biomass pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103580-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). For stem biomass, we also determined a difference of the principal component (PC) loadings associated with the PCA after different types of biomass pretreatment. Whereas the variable &#x201C;cellulose amount&#x201D; contributed most to the separation of factor 1 and &#x201C;lignin amount&#x201D; to factor 2 after single acidic biomass pretreatment, the PC loading pattern changed to &#x201C;ethanol production&#x201D; for factor 1 and &#x201C;cellulose amount&#x201D; for factor 2 after combined acidic and enzymatic pretreatment (Tab. S2). For leaf biomass, &#x201C;cellulose amount&#x201D; was the variable with the highest contribution to the separation of factor 1 and &#x201C;ethanol production&#x201D; of factor 2, which was independent of the applied biomass pretreatment method (Tab. S2). Except for stem biomass after single acidic pretreatment, the variable &#x201C;glucose amount from hemicellulose fraction&#x201D; revealed a constantly low contribution to the separation of the two factors associated with the PCA.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The suitability of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> as model plant for lignocellulosic ethanol production from leaf and stem biomass was analyzed in comparative study with the two major crops from temperate climate, <italic>T. aestivum</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic>, and the emerging energy crop <italic>M.</italic> x <italic>giganteus</italic>. The model qualities of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> were best for stem biomass from <italic>T. aestivum</italic> after thermo-chemical biomass pretreatment whereas model qualities for leaf biomass were only limited for all tested crop lines.
