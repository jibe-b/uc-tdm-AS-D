      <abstract>
        <p>Graphene oxide (GO) is widely used in various fields and is considered to be relatively biocompatible. Herein, &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity is first defined as toxic amplification of toxicants or pollutants by nanomaterials. This work revealed that GO greatly amplifies the phytotoxicity of arsenic (As), a widespread contaminant, in wheat, for example, causing a decrease in biomass and root numbers and increasing oxidative stress, which are thought to be regulated by its metabolisms. Compared with As or GO alone, GO combined with As inhibited the metabolism of carbohydrates, enhanced amino acid and secondary metabolism and disrupted fatty acid metabolism and the urea cycle. GO also triggered damage to cellular structures and electrolyte leakage and enhanced the uptake of GO and As. Co-transport of GO-loading As and transformation of As(V) to high-toxicity As(III) by GO were observed. The generation of dimethylarsinate, produced from the detoxification of inorganic As, was inhibited by GO in plants. GO also regulated phosphate transporter gene expression and arsenate reductase activity to influence the uptake and transformation of As, respectively. Moreover, the above effects of GO were concentration dependent. Given the widespread exposure to As in agriculture, the indirect nanotoxicity of GO should be carefully considered in food safety.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, a novel engineered nanomaterial, have been applied in various fields, such as biology, chemistry, medicine, exploration and environmental protection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Before using GO in such applications, it is essential to scientifically understand ecological risk and health significance of this material. The interactions of GO with biological molecules (DNA and proteins) as well as its cytotoxicity, uptake, pharmacokinetics and hematopathology have mainly been examined in animal experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, while its phytotoxicity remains largely unexplored. Considering that plants are the primary producers in ecosystems, understanding the interactions between nanomaterials and plants is crucial for comprehending the impact of nanomaterials on ecosystems and food safety. However, little progress has been made in this arena<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>The direct nanotoxicity of GO observed in living organisms suggests that GO is relatively biocompatible. For instance, GO acts as a general enhancer of cellular growth by increasing cell attachment and proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Further investigations based on histological examination of organ slices and hematological analyses revealed that GO toxicity in the treated animals was insignificant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The positive impacts of 400&#x2005;mg/L of GO included significant improvement of the plant health status indicated by decreased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and lipid and protein oxidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In fact, exposure of living organisms to multi-toxicants or pollutants is generally concomitant in the natural environment, rather than occurring in single exposure events. For instance, multiwalled carbon nanotubes and fullerenes increase the accumulation of pesticides in agricultural plants, with implications for food safety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Fullerenes also increase the toxicity and bioaccumulation of xenobiotic organic compounds in algae and crustaceans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Diuron sorbed onto carbon nanotubes enhances toxicity to <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Nano-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> significantly enhances the toxicity and accumulation of arsenic (As) (V) compounds in <italic>Ceriodaphnia dubia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. These results all indicate toxic amplification of toxicants or pollutants by nanomaterials. Herein, this phenomenon is defined as &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity.</p>
    <p>In addition to the amplification of uptake indicated above, &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity can involve multiple phenomena, such as toxic amplification of coexistent toxicants via the regulation of transformation, metabolism, genes, proteins and enzymes. As is a ubiquitous toxic element and shows the potential to pose a great risk to animal and human health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. GO, which has a large hydrophilic-specific surface, can directly adsorb and indirectly transform As species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most important food crops globally and is a recommended model organism in the guidelines for chemical testing proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Widespread As contamination in wheat is a global issue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The influence of GO on the uptake, transformation, metabolism and molecular toxicity of As in wheat is a critical issue in food safety. However, there is little available information related to this topic.</p>
    <p>The primary goals of this study were to thoroughly assess the indirect nanotoxicity of GO in relation to As in wheat. Specifically, we determined: (i) the effects of GO on phytotoxicity of As, including growth inhibition and oxidative stress; (ii) the metabolic regulation of toxicity amplification; (iii) the influence of cell structure damage and permeability on the uptake of GO and As; (iv) the regulation of As uptake and transformation through the chemical interactions of GO; and (v) the regulation of As uptake and transformation through the biological interactions of GO, such as through gene expression and enzymes catalysis.</p>

        <title>Characteristics of GO</title>
        <p>The surface chemistry of GO is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1</xref>. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images showed that GO included 59.99% C1s, 36.57% O1s and 3.44% N1s. C1s was shown to be a composite of C-C (46.79%), C-H (42.59%) and C-O-C (10.62%), while O1s was a composite of C = O (75.24%) and O = C-O (24.76%) and N1s was attributed to N-C (88.20%) and N = C (11.80%). These oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups result in the hydrophilic surface of GO. The characteristics of GO are further analyzed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2</xref>. A peak at 230&#x2005;nm and a peak shoulder from approximately 280 to 300&#x2005;nm, which are the typical adsorption peaks of GO, were observed. There was no obvious alteration of spectra after 8 days in the GO (10&#x2005;mg/L) solution, suggesting that GO is very stable in the aqueous phase. This excellent stability represents a benefit for the interactions between GO and organisms. Field emission transmission electron microscopy images showed irregular folds on GO nanosheets, which reflected the flexibility of GO. Atomic force microscope imaging demonstrated that the thickness of GO nanosheets was approximately 0.8&#x2013;1&#x2005;nm. The diameter ranged from approximately 1&#x2013;5&#x2005;&#x3BC;m. Hence, as a wide size distribution would increase the nondeterminacy of the nanotoxicity test GO was treated using ultrasound (150&#x2005;W, 30&#x2005;min) prior to nanotoxicity testing, leading to a narrow size distribution (465&#x2013;486&#x2005;nm, centered on 476&#x2005;nm). The Raman spectrum was used to characterize the structure of GO, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3</xref>. The typical D and G bands of graphene, located at approximately 1355 and 1602&#x2005;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, were detected; these bands reflect the disordered structure and ordered <italic>sp<sup>2</sup></italic> carbon system of graphene, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Other features included the 2D band and combined-mode D + G band located at approximately 2747 and 2939&#x2005;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively. The positions and intensity of the 2D bands reflect the number of graphene layers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>: the 2D band of single-layer graphene centers around 2679&#x2005;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the 2D/G intensity ratio of single-layer graphene is &gt;1.6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In this work, the 2D peak was located at approximately 2747&#x2005;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the 2D/G intensity ratio was found to be 0.6 for the single-layer GO. Compared to pristine graphene, the disagreement likely was due to the oxygen-containing groups in GO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>

        <title>GO amplifies the toxicity of As(V)</title>
        <p>The effects of GO and As(V) on wheat seed germination are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. Compared with the control, As(V) and GO did not significantly inhibit seed germination, by having assessed using the fresh weight, the germination rate, the root length, the root number and the shoot length, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>. Concerning positive effects, As(V) slightly increased the germination rate and the root number. The shoot length significantly reduced with an increase in the GO concentration in the AsGO groups. It appears that GO directly affected the shoot length and As(V) enhanced the impact of GO under the condition of As(V) and GO co-exposure. AsGO 0.1 markedly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced the shoot length and this reduction was more intensive with an increase in GO concentrations. AsGO 10 significantly reduced both the fresh weigh and the shoot length. Chlorophyll biosynthesis, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) exhibited similar effects to growth inhibition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref>. There were no significant differences between the control and As(V) groups. GO directly affected the SOD and POD activities, and the toxicity was significantly amplified by the co-exposure of As(V) and GO. AsGO induced a significant reduction of chlorophyll contents, especially that of chlorophyll b. The activity of SOD increased with an increase in the concentration of GO in the AsGO groups. The changes in MDA as an indicator of lipid peroxidation were not significant among all groups. The above results suggested that the relatively biocompatible GO markedly enhanced the phytotoxicity of As.</p>

        <title>Metabolism regulates the amplification of nanotoxicity</title>
        <p>Compared with proteins and genes, metabolic changes directly reflect biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Herein, metabolomics analyses were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of indirect nanotoxicity of GO in the presence of As. A total of 200 peaks in each sample were analyzed, and 65 metabolites were identified, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Tables S1 and S2</xref>. Compared with other results from metabolic analyses (e.g., using <sup>1</sup>H NMR technology), the applied extraction procedure and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry with the derivatization method were effective for analyzing the multiclass metabolites of plant cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. These metabolites correspond to the main metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid and fatty acid production, secondary metabolism and the urea cycle. The metabolites were analyzed using t-tests in Multiple Experiment Viewer 4, and the metabolites that were found to show significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the roots and shoots, which are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a and 2b</xref>, respectively. Based on hierarchical clustering (HCL) analysis, the root metabolites were divided into two clusters: the control and As/GO/AsGO. Furthermore, the As/GO/AsGO cluster was divided into two sub-clusters: As and GO/AsGO. Similarly, the shoot metabolites were divided into two clusters: the control and As/GO/AsGO; and As/GO/AsGO was further divided into two sub-clusters: As/GO and AsGO. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also employed to illustrate the metabolic specificity among different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c</xref>). The samples were divided into two groups: the control and As/GO/AsGO. The discrete scores suggested that the metabolism displayed significant differences among the As, GO and AsGO groups. The above results demonstrated that AsGO markedly altered the metabolism in the control, As and GO groups.</p>
        <p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that the root number and chlorophyll b content were sensitive to AsGO toxicity in the roots and shoots, respectively. To further assess metabolic regulation, using both the root number and chlorophyll b as Y variables, an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was implemented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figures S4&#x2013;6</xref>). In the roots, 7 of 23 metabolites showed a positive coefficient CS (coeffCS) value, indicating that these metabolites made positive contributions to the observed root number. Among these 7 metabolites, AsGO reduced the contents of xylose, maltose, aspartic acid and aconitic acid with a VIP (variable importance for the projection) of more than 0.7. Accordingly, the remaining metabolites made negative contributions to the observed root number. AsGO increased the contents of 16 metabolites, and the metabolites exhibiting a VIP of more than 1.4 included naphthalene, monopalmitin, asparagine, galactose and cyclononasiloxane octadecamethyl-. In the shoots, 9 of 57 metabolites with a positive coeffCS made positive contributions to the anabolism of chlorophyll b. Among these 9 metabolites, AsGO decreased the contents of galactopyranoside and galactose, which showed a positive coeffCS with a VIP of more than 1.3. The remaining 48 metabolites made negative contributions to the anabolism of chlorophyll b. AsGO enhanced the contents of the 48 metabolites, and the metabolites with a VIP of more than 1.3 included monopalmitin, galactofuranoside, pentaric acid, propanoic acid, alkane, lysine, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, leucine and isoleucine. The identified high-VIP metabolites are organized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, which indicates the effects of AsGO on the main metabolic pathways of cells. Compared with the control and the As-only and GO-only treatments, AsGO inhibited carbohydrate metabolism, enhanced amino acid and secondary metabolism and disturbed fatty acid metabolism and the urea cycle. These results are the first to reveal the mechanisms underlying indirect nanotoxicity using metabolomics.</p>

        <title>Promoted damage of the cell structure by uptake of GO and As</title>
        <p>To investigate the structural damage to the cell wall and plasma membrane, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra and electrolyte leakage in root cells were studied. Compared with the control/As-only/GO-only treatments, AsGO increased the abundance of amino groups, hydroxyl groups, cellulose and polysaccharides on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>), indicating structural damage to the cell wall and plasma membrane. Electrolyte leakage was further used to detect membrane permeability. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref>, As and GO did not induce obvious electrolyte leakage. However, AsGO led to significant electrolyte leakage, which increased with the GO concentration. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the structural damage to the cell wall and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The plasma membrane was close to the cell wall in the control, and slight plasmolysis occurred in the As sample. However, remarkable plasmolysis was observed in the GO sample and especially for the AsGO sample, as indicated by the pink arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a&#x2013;d</xref>. The elliptical outlines of root cells changed to irregular outlines in the GO and AsGO images. In the shoot TEM images from the control, As and GO groups, elliptical chloroplasts adhered to the plasma membrane and regular thylakoids in the chloroplasts were visible. However, the elliptical chloroplasts became circular and were distant from the plasma membrane, and the structure of the thylakoid was damaged in shoot TEM images from the AsGO group, as indicated by the yellow and black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5e&#x2013;g</xref>. In addition, plasma membrane folding was observed, as indicated with a blue circle in an AsGO image. It is possible that GO increased the permeability of plant cells and then enhanced the uptake of GO and As via passive transport across the plasma membrane. Compared with the control and As samples, remarkable GO deposition was observed in roots exposed to GO and AsGO, as indicated by the green arrows. Compared with GO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5g</xref>), AsGO induced a great deal of GO deposition, which is indicated in the cytoplasm with blue arrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5h</xref>) for shoot samples.</p>
        <p>There is no question of the intracellular uptake of As, but the uptake of GO in plant cells remains unclear. To characterize the uptake of GO, the compositions of the dark dots in plant cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5d</xref> (root) and h (shoot) were characterized using the Raman spectra, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>. The typical D and G bands of GO located at 1,349 and 1,590&#x2005;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> were detected in the dark dot compositions of the root samples. In contrast, there were no obvious GO peaks outside of the dark dots. Similar results were found in the shoot samples, although the signals were very weak. These results demonstrated that GO entered the plant cells. Furthermore, TEM-EDX was used to semi-quantitatively analyze the uptake of As (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). In the root samples, the content of As inside and outside of the dark dots was 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. For the shoot samples, the content of As inside and outside of the dark dots was 0.4% and 0.0%, respectively. The above results demonstrated that As loaded onto GO was taken up via co-transport. In summary, cell structure damage enhanced the uptake of GO and As.</p>

        <title>GO regulates As uptake and transformation through genes and enzymes</title>
        <p>The uptake and transformation of As(V) were further quantified using the liquid chromatograph-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HPLC-ICP-MS). The uptake rate of As was high in the plants, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8a</xref>. Compared with the 19.9% rate of As uptake recorded without GO exposure, the uptake rate of As increased to 24.6% and 32.1%, then decreased to 16.1% in the presence of GO concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10&#x2005;mg/L, respectively. Therefore, the regulation of uptake of As by GO was concentration dependent. Both of As(V) and As(III) were detected in all groups, suggesting transformation of As(V) to As(III) <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, DMA was detected in the group exposed to As(V) alone. GO enhanced the accumulation ratio of As(III) in the roots, with root-to-shoot concentration ratio of 14.0, 10.9, 16.8 and 22.1 being observed in the As, AsGO 0.1, AsGO 1 and AsGO 10 groups, respectively. The accumulation ratio for As(V) was 4.2, 9.1, 11.4 and 7.2 in As, AsGO 0.1, AsGO 1 and AsGO 10 groups, respectively, showing concentration dependence. In summary, the generation of DMA to detoxify inorganic As was inhibited by GO, and GO led to the accumulation of high-toxicity As(III) in wheat roots.</p>
        <p>To identify roles of direct chemical regulation in As uptake and transformation by GO, the interaction of GO with As(V) in the aqueous phase was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8b</xref>). In the As-only group, 13.4% of As(V) was transformed to As(III). In the other groups, GO did not significantly alter transformation of As(V). However, 73.5&#x2013;76.6% of the transformed As(III) was absorbed on GO, and the rate of transformation was not significantly different in the different groups. The ratio of absorbed As to total As increased with the GO concentration, with values of 3.1, 8.9 and 12.1% being obtained in GO 0.1, GO 1 and GO 10, respectively. These results showed that As, especially As(III), was adsorbed onto GO, but GO played a limited role in transformation of As through direct chemical reactions. To further identify the functions of biological regulation in As uptake and transformation by GO, the intracellular activities of key enzymes and gene expression were quantified, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8c</xref>. GO at low and moderate concentrations (0.1 and 1&#x2005;mg/L) enhanced the expression of phosphate transporter genes that transport As through the plasma membrane, but their expression decreased under a high concentration of 10&#x2005;mg/L GO. The activity of arsenate reductase, which plays an important role in transformation of As(V) to As(III), showed similar changes to the expression of phosphate transporter genes. The activity of arsenate reductase was enhanced and then inhibited by increasing GO concentrations. These results demonstrated that GO regulated As uptake and transformation through both chemical and biological processes and this regulation was concentration dependent.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In general, GO is thought to be relatively biocompatible compared with metal nanoparticles and other carbon nanomaterials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. No adverse effects of GO on the growth and biomass of higher plants, such as cabbage, tomato, red spinach and lettuce, have been observed at concentrations below 400&#x2005;mg/L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Treatment with GO dosages ranging from 0.1 to 10&#x2005;mg/L does not significantly disturb seed germination in wheat, as demonstrated based on the growth, biomass and oxidative stress of the plants. Although GO slightly reduced root growth, the reduction was not remarkable. The amino groups on biological cells could interact with GO, resulting in GO wrapping or adsorbing around cells; the cells were then isolated from the culture medium, leading to a reduction in plant growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Treatment with As(V) at a concentration of 10&#x2005;mg/L also did not induce significant adverse effects, but considerable adverse effects were observed when wheat was exposed to As(V) and GO together, even at a very low dose (0.1&#x2005;mg/L) of GO. Compared with that in the control, the application of 0.1&#x2005;mg/L of GO with As triggered a reduction of shoot length and chlorophyll b contents and a increase of SOD activity. Similarly, when the 24-h mortality of <italic>Ceriodaphnia dubia</italic> was assessed, 2.4&#x2013;3.2&#x2005;mg/L As(V) led to an increase from 2.5&#x2013;37.5% without nanoparticles to 43&#x2013;65% in the presence of 10&#x2013;50&#x2005;mg/L nano-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and nano-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Given that As contamination is widespread in agricultural plants such as wheat, rice and corn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, the impact of &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity on food safety should be considered.</p>
      <p>The potential benefits of applying metabolomics to reveal molecular mechanisms of nanotoxicology and nanomedicine are only starting to be realised<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Compared with the control/As-only/GO-only treatments, AsGO inhibited carbohydrate metabolism, except for galactofuranoside. The inhibition of carbohydrate metabolism was linked to the insufficiency of energy supplementation, which was consistent with growth inhibition. Carbohydrate metabolism is also considered to be an indicator of osmoprotection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Thus, the results depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref> indicate that AsGO increased cellular electrolyte leakage. There is extensive and unequivocal evidence that amino acid metabolism and secondary metabolism in plants are associated with the cellular response to the stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. AsGO enhanced amino acid and secondary metabolism, including that of leucine, glycine, phenylalanine, naphthalene and octadecamethyl-cyclononasiloxane. Compared with that in the other groups, AsGO significantly enhanced the accumulation of a saturated fatty acid (alkane). Increases in saturated fatty acids are linked to the reduction of membrane fluidity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, which most likely led to the membrane structure damage depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>. AsGO also disturbed the urea cycle and induced the accumulation of amino acids, such as lysine, threonine, asparagine and isoleucine. Specifically, the pathway of nitrogen storage was altered. These metabolic responses may be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity amplification from the co-exposure of As(V) and GO to plants.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms of the uptake of GO, and even carbon nanomaterials, into plant cells remain obscure at present. Fullerenes up to 100&#x2005;nm in diameter enter the gaps between the cell wall and the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, suggesting that nanomaterials can penetrate a cell wall even when they are larger than the cell wall pores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c and d</xref>, uptake of GO was observed in TEM images and was confirmed by the Raman spectra presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>. Generally, the uptake of nanomaterials is increased by the enhancement of permeability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. AsGO triggered structural damage to the cell wall and plasma membrane and increased electrolyte leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), which generally occurred for very high concentrations (more than 100&#x2005;mg/L) of GO exposure to cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c and d</xref> demonstrates that plasmolysis occurred. It has been proposed that carbon nanotube and nano-ZnO materials enter the roots of seedlings by increasing the permeability of plant cell walls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. After the uptake of GO and As, the damage and structural alterations observed in organelles were considerable, including destruction of chloroplasts, which corresponded to a decrease of chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>
      <p>Another important finding was that As accumulated on GO in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>), demonstrating that GO increased the uptake of As via co-transport. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8a</xref> shows that 0.1 and 1&#x2005;mg/L GO enhanced the uptake of As, whereas 10&#x2005;mg/L GO reduced As uptake. Concerning direct chemical interactions, our results showed that As, and especially As(III), could be absorbed on GO, and the absorption increased with the GO concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8b</xref>). These findings implied that the uptake of As involved pathways other than chemical interactions alone. It has been reported that As is taken up by plants via phosphate transporters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Recently, the genotoxicity of graphene-based materials has attracted much attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8c</xref> shows that low concentrations of GO increased the expression of phosphate transporter genes, while high concentrations of GO decreased their expression. Therefore, GO influenced the uptake of As via at least three pathways: permeability regulation, co-transport and transporter gene regulation. DMA is a less toxic methylated form of inorganic As<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. GO inhibited the formation of DMA in plants and then enhanced the phytotoxicity of As, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8a</xref>. As(III) is more toxic in terms of ecological and health risks than As(V)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8a</xref> shows that the ratio of As(III) to As(V) first increased and then decreased with the GO concentration in both the roots and shoots. Concerning direct chemical reactions, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8b</xref>, GO increased the transformation of As(V) to As(III), but there was no significant change associated with the GO concentration. Arsenate reductase activity is considered to play a critical role in the transformation of As(V) to As(III) in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. GO regulated the transformation of As through arsenate reductase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8c</xref>). Therefore, GO regulated the uptake and transformation of As through chemical and biological processes together.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity is defined as toxic amplification of other toxicants or pollutants by nanomaterials. This work comprehensively analyzed &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity of the relatively biocompatible GO, which amplified the phytotoxicity of widespread As in wheat. The indirect nanotoxicity of GO involved at least five components, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S7</xref>: (i) enhancement of growth inhibition and oxidative stress; (ii) regulation of key forms of metabolism, such as carbohydrate, amino acid and secondary metabolism; (iii) increasing damage to cell structures and permeability; (iv) regulation of As uptake and transformation via chemical interactions, such as through As loading onto GO entering the cell; and (v) regulation of As uptake and transformation via biological interactions, such as transporter gene expression and enzyme catalysis. Given the widespread exposure to As in agriculture, &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; nanotoxicity of GO should be considered in relation to food safety.</p>

        <p>To obtain representative material from large plant tissues, root and shoot tips (length, 1&#x2005;cm) were collected from more than 30 random plants using a sharp knife. To avoid metabolic alterations during preparation, the root and shoot tips (0.1&#x2005;g) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ground with 2&#x2005;mL of a solution of methanol:chloroform:water (volumetric ratio = 2.5:1:1) and 0.2&#x2005;mg/mL ribitol (50&#x2005;&#x3BC;L) as an internal standard.
