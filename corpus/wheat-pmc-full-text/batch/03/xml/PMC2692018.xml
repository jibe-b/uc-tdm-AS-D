        <p>Stem lodging-resistance is an important phenotype in crop production. In the present study, the expression of the wheat COMT gene (<italic>TaCM</italic>) was determined in basal second internodes of lodging-resistant (H4564) and lodging-susceptible (C6001) cultivars at stem elongation, heading, and milky endosperm corresponding to Zadoks stages Z37, Z60, and Z75, respectively. The TaCM protein levels were analysed by protein gel blot and COMT enzyme activity was determined during the same stem developmental stages. TaCM mRNA levels were higher in H4546 from elongation to the milky stages and in C6001 the TaCM mRNA levels decreased markedly at the heading and milky stages. The TaCM protein levels and COMT activity were also higher in H4564 than that in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. These results corresponded to a higher lignin content measured by the Klason method and stem strength and a lower lodging index in H4564 than in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. Therefore, the TaCM mRNA levels, protein levels, and enzyme activity in developing wheat stems were associated with stem strength and lodging index in these two wheat cultivars. Southern analysis in a different population suggested that a TaCM locus was located in the distal region of chromosome 3BL, which has less investigated by QTL for lodging-resistant phenotype.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Crop lodging is a complicated phenomenon that is influenced by many factors from physiology and genetics, to husbandry and environment. Lodging is a major problem in crop production which causes poor grain filling and yield loss, reduces grain quality and mechanical harvesting efficiency (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, and references therein). The dwarfness of the crop using dwarfing genes and the application of plant growth regulators have been very effective tools for reducing the risk of lodging and maintaining a steady yield. However, they have not completely eradicated lodging risk. Furthermore, a reduction in plant height for lodging resistance may reduce the photosynthetic capacity of a canopy which would then limit the final yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). An analysis of the dwarfing genes on crop yield has shown that the optimum plant height for maximum photosynthetic capacity is between 70 cm and 100 cm in wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flintham <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Therefore, alternative strategies for further improvement in lodging resistance of crops must be developed.</p>
      <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sterling <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>, two types of lodging occur in wheat. Stem lodging results from the bending or breaking of the lower culm internodes, while root lodging refers to intact and unbroken culms leaning from the crown due to failure of root anchorage on ground. Stem strength, the bending or breaking strength of the culm, is important for stem lodging resistance, particularly for the basal internodes of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zuber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Increasing stem strength will be a very promising strategy to breed crops with high lodging resistance and yield. Except for stem weight and diameter which are closely related to physical strength, stem strength is also the product of its chemical and biochemical components. Stem tissues of crops mainly contain the storage and structural carbohydrates. Recent reports have shown that higher starch accumulation in the stem tissues is responsible for the higher lodging resistance in rice during typhoons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kashiwagi and Ishimaru, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashiwagi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In theory, the structural carbohydrates (cellulose and lignin) should also play the (even more) important roles for material strength in stems.</p>
      <p>Lignin is a phenolic cell wall polymer closely linked to cellulose and hemicelluloses, and is, second to cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on earth. In plants, lignin mainly deposits in the walls of certain specialized cells such as tracheary elements, sclerenchyma, and phloem fibres. This leads to a dramatic change in cell wall properties, which impart strength and structural support to the wall and assists in the transport of water and nutrients within xylem tissue by decreasing the permeability of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boerjan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It has long been proposed that lignin synthesis might be related to stem strength. This issue is especially important in monocotyledonous crop plants, where weak stem strength will lead to a lodging phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). To date, however, there is little information at the molecular level as to how the regulation of lignin synthesis affects crop lodging. Reduced lignin levels have been observed in maize <italic>brown-midrib</italic> (<italic>bm</italic>) mutants and this has been associated with reduced stem strength. Recent work has confirmed that the <italic>bm3</italic> mutant harboured a mutation in the gene for caffeic acid 3-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.68, COMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vignols <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), while <italic>bm1</italic> was shown to affect directly expression of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.195, CAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Some brittleness mutants have been reported in barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokubo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>) and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinoshita, 1998</xref>). A COBRA-like regulation protein has been reported to be involved in brittle stalk mutants in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sindhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The actions of these mutants on gene levels, however, are largely unknown.</p>
      <p>A cDNA fragment for COMT from wheat has been isolated and RNA gel blot analysis showed that this gene was differentially expressed in lodging-sensitive and -resistant cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The full-length cDNA for this COMT, <italic>TaCM</italic>, was obtained by screening wheat stem cDNA library and the functional expression and transgenic approach have demonstrated that TaCM is an authentic COMT involved in lignin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma and Xu, 2008</xref>). The analyses of <italic>TaCM</italic> gene expression, enzyme activity, and protein content in relation to the lodging-resistant phenotype in wheat is reported here. The <italic>TaCM</italic> locus was mapped in the chromosome.</p>

        <p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) plants were grown in a naturally lit greenhouse with normal irrigation and fertilization. Two cultivars, C6001 and H4564, were chosen for our analyses. C6001 and H4564 developed from the same pedigree of Jimai from the Hebei province of China. Both cultivars have the same growth period (240 d) and vernalization type (winter), similar morphological and agricultural phenotypes (with plant height of 75&#x2013;80 cm, diameter of the mature stem of 2.97&#x2013;3.27 mm, kernel number per spike of 18&#x2013;20, and grain number per kernel of 28&#x2013;36 with mature seed weight 38&#x2013;41 g per 1000 seeds), but differ in stem lodging phenotype, in which C6001 is lodging-sensitive while H4564 is lodging-resistant. The stem lodging level (as judged by the angle of the stem to the vertical position of more than 30<sup>o</sup>) just before harvest was 25&#x2013;30% for C6001 and 2&#x2013;4% for H4564 in the flood irrigation field with 10&#x2013;15% and 0%, respectively, in dry farmland. The majority of lodgings observed are due to stem breakage so they belong to stem lodging predominates. Basal second internodes were collected from the wheat plants with three internodes, and then collected at 3 week intervals at the stem elongation, heading, and milky endosperm stages, corresponding to Zadoks stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zadoks <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>) Z37, Z60, and Z75, respectively. Previous investigations have shown that the second internodes play the more important role in wheat lodging resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zuber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>

        <p>Total RNA was isolated from wheat internode tissue by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc, Cincinnati, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten &#x3BC;g of each total RNA sample was electrophoresed on formaldehyde 1.4% (w/v) agarose gels. RNA was blotted onto Hybond-N<sup>+</sup> membrane (Amersham, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ 08855-1327, USA) using the standard transfer procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sambrook <italic>et al.</italic> (1989)</xref>. The blots were hybridized at 42 <sup>o</sup>C with 6&#xD7; SSC, 5&#xD7; Denhardt, 0.5% SDS, 100 &#x3BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> salmon sperm DNA with 50% formamide, and washed with 0.1&#xD7; SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 &#xB0;C. Probes were <sup>32</sup>P-labelled using a Ready-to-Go DNA Labeling Kit (Amersham). RNA hybridization signals were normalized by a soybean 18S ribosomal RNA.</p>
        <p>The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the RT-PCR kit (TakaRa, Japan) with total RNA. Reverse transcription reactions were carried out at 42 &#xB0;C for 60 min and terminated by heating to 95 &#xB0;C for 10 min. One microlitre of the reaction mixture was used as a template in the PCR reaction. The parameters for 30 cycles were 95 &#xB0;C for 1 min, 55 &#xB0;C for 1 min, and 72 &#xB0;C for 1.5 min, with a final extension at 72 &#xB0;C for 10 min. The PCR products were loaded onto 1% agarose gel to visualize the amplified cDNAs.

The soluble protein fractions were used for the COMT enzyme assay. COMT enzyme activities were measured according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ni <italic>et al.</italic> (1996)</xref>.

        <title>Stem strength and lodging index determination</title>
        <p>Wheat basal second internodes were collected from the field. The stem strength and lodging index (<italic>LI</italic>) was determined according to the method of Wang and Li (1996). In brief, stem strength was measured using a three point bending method where the freshly collected 5 cm stem segments (span more than 10&#xD7; the diameter) were placed horizontally and mounted on two supports in the rack of the apparatus. The force exerted to break the stem was recorded with a universal force testing device (model DC-KZ300, Sichuan, China) to determine the stem strength (<italic>S</italic>). The fresh weight (<italic>G</italic>) of the aerial part, and height (<italic>H</italic>) to the centre of gravity (measured by balancing the whole plant in the centre position) of each single wheat plant were determined. <italic>LI</italic> was calculated by following formula: <italic>LI</italic>=<italic>G</italic>&#xD7;<italic>H/S</italic>. Fifteen stem samples were determined.</p>
        <p>Student's <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geng and Hills, 1989</xref>) was applied to determine the difference between C6001 and H4564 cultivars and the probability value was estimated at the <italic>P</italic><sub>0.05</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>0.01</sub> levels.

        <p>As the basal internodes play a crucial role in stem lodging resistance in wheat, the basal second internodes were used to determine the stem strength and lodging index from three different developing stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The stem strength of H4564 was always higher than that of C6001, and this difference was particularly remarkable at the heading and milky stages, which was more than 95.1% and 78.4%, respectively. Consistent with the high stem strength, the lodging index of H4564 was significant lower than that of C6001, consistent with its lodging-resistant phenotype.</p>

        <title>Lignin accumulations in relation to wheat stem development</title>
        <p>To determine whether lignin synthesis was associated with stem strength and lodging resistance, lignin content was analysed in the basal second internodes at different developmental stages in the two wheat cultivars (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). From elongation to the milky stage, the content of Klason lignin increased accordingly, reflecting active lignin synthesis during wheat stem maturity. The Klason lignin content of H4564 was significantly higher than that of C6001 at the heading and milky stages, more than 66.3% and 42.1%, respectively. By contrast, there was no remarkable difference for lignin content between the two cultivars at the elongation stage.</p>

        <p>RT-PCR analysis showed that the <italic>TaCM</italic> gene was constitutively expression in stem, leaf, and root tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating that <italic>TaCM</italic> is associated with the constitutive lignification process in various vegetative growing tissues. <italic>TaCM</italic> gene expression was analysed in the basal second internodes at different stem developmental stages by Northern blot hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). At the elongation stage, the <italic>TaCM</italic> mRNA levels in C6001 and H4564 were similar high. At the heading and milky stages, the <italic>TaCM</italic> mRNA levels in H4564 stem still remained very high, while these mRNA levels declined very markedly in C6001. Quantification of the <italic>TaCM1</italic> mRNA levels with a Phosphor Image with 18S rRNA normalization confirmed these results. By contrast to the stem tissues, the <italic>TaCM</italic> mRNA levels in leaf tissues of the two wheat cultivars did not show much difference at different developmental stages (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Lodging resistance in crops represents a quantitative trait that is suggested to be involved in the actions of many genes and is difficult to assess on a phenotypic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Therefore, to link the actions of a single gene directly to the lodging resistant phenotype will not only be very useful in elucidating this complex agronomic trait but also helpful in developing lodging-resistant cultivars in crop-breeding programmes.</p>
      <p>In theory, lignin determines the physical strength of plants, as a lower lignin content causes stems to be soft and brittle. Some mutants called <italic>bm</italic> were obtained which were shown to be associated with low lignin quantity and low stem strength. The first <italic>bm</italic> mutant was described in maize as early as 1924. Based on morphological and genetic analyses, four mutants named <italic>bm1</italic>, <italic>bm2</italic>, <italic>bm3</italic>, and <italic>bm4</italic> were described in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cherney <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barri&#xE8;re <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). These mutations were found to be located on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, and 9, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuc <italic>et al.</italic>, 1968</xref>). However, until recently, the <italic>bm3</italic> mutation was demonstrated to occur in the gene encoding COMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vignols <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Since the COMT protein is encoded by a single gene in maize, the results indicated that the <italic>bm3</italic> mutation had arisen from a retrotransposon event or a deletion of part of the COMT gene that had been cloned previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collazo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). As the maize COMT gene is known to be strongly expressed in roots and to a lesser extent in the stems and leaves, the reason why this mutation leads to the visible phenotype in stem and leaf tissues is still questionable. Another mutant, <italic>bm1</italic>, was demonstrated to be closely associated with, if not identical to, the gene encoding CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). CAD activity was reduced in <italic>bm1</italic> mutant plants but the strong reduction was observed in root (90&#x2013;97% reduction) and leaf midrib (70% reduction) tissues, not in stem tissues. Furthermore, two bands were detected in Western and Northern blot hybridization although Southern hybridization suggested that there was only a single CAD gene in the maize genome. Clearly, the issue of lignin synthesis with plant tissue strength and lodging resistance, particularly in stems, still needs intensive investigation.</p>
      <p>The natural mutation for lignin synthesis in wheat is still lacking. For this reason, it was hoped to use another approach to explore the relationship between lignin synthesis and the wheat stem lodging-resistant phenotype. A COMT cDNA was cloned from wheat, namely <italic>TaCM</italic>. Its biochemical identification as an authentic COMT enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis was confirmed by an analysis of enzyme activity and a transgenic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma and Xu, 2008</xref>). Genetic mapping indicated that the <italic>TaCM</italic> gene was present as a single locus in the wheat genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast to maize, the wheat <italic>TaCM</italic> gene was actively expressed in stem tissues, suggesting that it played a role in lignin biosynthesis and stem development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The <italic>TaCM</italic> gene expression was kept fairly high from the elongation to the milky stages in the basal second internodes of the lodging-resistant cultivar (H4564), but it declined markedly at the heading and milky stages in the lodging-sensitive cultivar (C6001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). In agreement with these results, TaCM protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) and COMT activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) exhibited the significant differences between H4564 and C6001 at the heading and milky stages. The <italic>TaCM</italic> gene exists as a single copy in the wheat genome. Furthermore, only a single band was detected in wheat stem tissues using an anti-alfalfa COMT antibody, and this band exhibited a similar immunological reaction with the recombinant TaCM protein that was expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. These results suggest that the COMT protein and activity detected in wheat basal second internodes is likely to corresponding to the <italic>TaCM</italic> gene. Therefore, high <italic>TaCM</italic> gene expression will lead the more TaCM protein and enzyme activity, which results in more lignin accumulation in the basal second internodes of the H4564 cultivar and, subsequently, makes these internodes have strong strength and exhibit high lodging resistance.</p>
      <p>The comparison of the different parameters between C6001 to H4564 cultivars revealed that stem strength and lodging index showed good consistency. The difference in the lignin content between two cultivars was in proportion to that of stem strength and lodging index, and this difference was remarkable at the heading stage rather than at the milky stage. The total increase in lignin content from C6001 to H4564 was a little lower than that of the stem strength and lodging index, which may reflect that a small increase in lignin content will result in a high increase in stem strength and lodging resistance. TaCM enzyme activity, however, exhibited a slightly different trend with the other three parameters. In one aspect, TaCM activity showed more increase at the milky stage than at the heading stage. In another aspect, the total increase of TaCM activity from C6001 to H4564 was less than these other parameters, for example, a 32.5% increase in TaCM activity versus 95.65%, 78.6%, and 66.3% in stem strength, lodging index, and lignin content, respectively, at the heading stage. This reflects that other genes may also be involved in lignin biosynthesis and contribute to the stem strength and lodging resistance. In fact, of two CCR genes that have been analysed in wheat, <italic>CCR1</italic> has also been shown to contribute to lignin biosynthesis and stem strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma and Tian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma, 2007</xref>). What and how <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>TaCM</italic> genes influence this process is an interesting issue and will warrant further investigation. It suggests that different genes will together regulate the whole lignin biosynthesis pathway, and then lead to lignin accumulation in certain tissues at the proper developmental time, subsequently making the stem have high strength and a lodging-resistant phenotype. <italic>TaCM</italic> will be a regulating point or marker for what takes place in the whole lignin biosynthesis pathway.</p>
      <p>In general, lignin or cellulose in the cell wall determines the physical strength of plant tissues, particular for lignin. Cellulose has good tensile strength, but it is soft and flexible in nature, while lignin is much like a polyether network, with a large molecular weight, random structure, and an enormous capacity to cross-link with cellulose together with the process of thickening plant secondary walls, which makes the plant tissue's mechanical intensity and supportable ability. In practice, however, the roles of lignin and cellulose in crop lodging resistance are not consistent. In maize, evidence from <italic>bm</italic> mutants have shown that lignin is involved in lodging resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vignols <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halpin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In rice, the <italic>brittle culm1</italic> (<italic>bc1</italic>) mutant, which altered the expression of a COBRA-like protein, causes a reduction in cell wall thickness and mechanical strength. The <italic>bc1</italic> mutant, however, exhibits a reduction in cellulose content but an increase in lignin level, suggesting that cellulose instead of lignin plays an important role in the cell wall mechanical strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). By contrast, the maize <italic>brittle stalk2</italic> (<italic>bk2</italic>) mutant, which is involved in a COBRA-like protein similar to rice <italic>bc1</italic>, exhibits a similar cellulose content as the wild type in developing stems and a loss of staining lignin in the vascular bundles and sclereid layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sindhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, two loci have been identified that are responsible for the higher starch accumulation and, consequently, for the higher lodging resistance during typhoons in the lower and upper rice stems, respectively, which show that a high accumulation of starch in the stem instead of structural carbohydrates such as lignin and cellulose, plays the vital role for lodging resistance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kashiwagi and Ishimaru, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashiwagi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The different roles of lignin in lodging resistance between rice versus maize and wheat are unclear at present. It is possible that the aquatic versus the terrestrial environments that are used to cultivate these crops may affect the contribution of lignin and cellulose to mechanical strength in crop stems.</p>
      <p>Analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can reveal the genetic basis of relationships among traits, this is particularly important for comprehensive understanding of complex traits such as lodging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuthbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Comparisons among QTLs for lodging traits have been made in several crop plants. In barley, one QTL has been associated with grain yield, plant height, and lodging severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spaner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Two loci on chromosome 5, namely <italic>prl5</italic> and <italic>lrt5</italic>, have been identified for the improved lodging resistance of the lower and upper stems, respectively, in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kashiwagi and Ishimaru, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, multiple QTLs for stem diameter are required for the best pushing resistance but only a single QTL (namely <italic>sdm8</italic>) has been identified to contribute to thicker stems towards lodging resistance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashiwagi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Nine lodging resistant QTLs have been identified, but five of them have been shown to be coincident with QTLs for plant height in a population between wheat and spelt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In another report using the doubled haploid population derived from two Canadian wheat cultivars, three QTLs have been identified for lodging resistance in chromosome 4D, 5A, and 6D in wheat. One of three QTLs for lodging coincides with a plant height QTL which is located on chromosome 4DS. Only QTL QLdg.crc-5A detected in this report is in a similar position to a QTL for lodging on chromosome 5AL identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller <italic>et al.</italic> (1999)</xref>. This QTL is also associated with a yield QTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Using a population of 132 F<sub>12</sub> RILs derived by single-seed descent from a cross between the Chinese facultative wheat Ning7840 and the US soft red winter wheat Clark, three QTLs for lodging score were identified in linkage groups 1B, 4AL, and 5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The QTL in 5A is in the similar location as QTL of lodging resistance reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller <italic>et al.</italic> (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref>. Using a population of 96 doubled haploid lines from the cross &#x2018;Milan&#x2019;&#xD7;&#x2018;Catbird&#x2019; wheat, QTL for lodging and associated traits were found on chromosomes IB, ID, 2B, 2D, 4B, 4D, 6D, and 7D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Verma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). A doubled-haploid population was generated from the cross RL4452&#xD7;&#x2018;AC Domain&#x2019; spring wheat, and three QTLs were identified to control plant lodging in chromosomes 4B, 4D, and 3D, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCartney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). A doubled-haploid population was derived from anther culture of the wheat cross CA9613 and H1488 and stem strength and related basal internode traits were measured at the milk stage in this population. A total of six QTLs for stem strength, culm wall thickness, pith diameter, and stem diameter were identified on chromosomes 1A, 2D, 3A, and 3B, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These data indicate that multiple genes are involved in lodging resistance, consistent with physiological analysis. As there is low resolution power of QTL experiments, it is difficult from the above data to detect the real number of genes that regulate the lodging resistant trait. The <italic>TaCM</italic> gene identified is the first genetic locus with a clear biochemical function that links with lodging phenotype in wheat. It is interesting that the <italic>TaCM</italic> locus is located on chromosome 3B, which is not overlapped by any other lodging QTLs that have been reported previously. Chromosome 3B is also mentioned as one of the locations of a stem solidness gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanning <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and two QTLs for stem strength and diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), although they do not overlap with the <italic>TaCM</italic> locus. Therefore, <italic>TaCM</italic> plus stem strength, diameter, and solidness loci in chromosome 3B will be useful for the rapid development of lodging-resistant genotypes using a marker-assisted selection approach. It would be an interesting further experiment to test the relationship among these loci and whether they co-segregates with a stem lodging phenotype.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, a COMT gene, namely <italic>TaCM</italic>, was characterized from wheat. Its mRNA levels were examined in lodging-resistant (H4564) and lodging-sensitive (C6001) cultivars in the basal second internodes at different stem developmental stages. <italic>TaCM</italic> mRNA levels in H4564 remained constantly high from the elongation to the milky stages, while they declined markedly in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. TaCM protein levels, determined by protein gel blot, were higher in H4564 than that in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. COMT activity was also 33&#x2013;45% higher in H4564 than that in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. These corresponded to the higher Klason lignin content (about 42&#x2013;66%), higher stem strength (about 78&#x2013;95%), and lower lodging index (about 70&#x2013;80%) in H4564 than that in C6001 during these developmental stages. This suggests that the regulation on <italic>TaCM</italic> gene expression is involved in lignin synthesis and subsequently contributes to stem strength and the lodging-resistant trait in wheat C6001 and H4564 cultivars. The <italic>TaCM</italic> locus was genetically mapped to chromosome 3B which would be useful for the rapid development of lodging-resistant genotypes using a marker-assisted selection approach.</p>
