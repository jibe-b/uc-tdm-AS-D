        <p>Responses to prolonged low-temperature treatment of imbibed seeds (vernalization) were examined in barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>). These occurred in two phases: the perception of prolonged cold, which occurred gradually at low temperatures, and the acceleration of reproductive development, which occurred after vernalization. Expression of the <italic>VERNALIZATION1</italic> gene (<italic>HvVRN1</italic>) increased gradually in germinating seedlings during vernalization, both at the shoot apex and in the developing leaves. This occurred in darkness, independently of <italic>VERNALIZATION2</italic> (<italic>HvVRN2</italic>), consistent with the hypothesis that expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is induced by prolonged cold independently of daylength flowering-response pathways. After vernalization, expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> was maintained in the shoot apex and leaves. This was associated with accelerated inflorescence initiation and with down-regulation of <italic>HvVRN2</italic> in the leaves. The largest determinant of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> expression levels in vernalized plants was the length of seed vernalization treatment. Daylength did not influence <italic>HvVRN1</italic> expression levels in shoot apices and typically did not affect expression in leaves. In the leaves of plants that had experienced a saturating seed vernalization treatment, expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> was higher in long days, however. <italic>HvFT1</italic> was expressed in the leaves of these plants in long days, which might account for the elevated <italic>HvVRN1</italic> expression. Long-day up-regulation of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> was not required for inflorescence initiation, but might accelerate subsequent stages of inflorescence development. Similar responses to seed vernalization were also observed in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>). These data support the hypothesis that <italic>VRN1</italic> is induced by cold during winter to promote spring flowering in vernalization-responsive cereals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Prolonged cold treatment of imbibed seeds, or vernalization, promotes flowering of many temperate cereals, including varieties of wheat, barley, oat, and rye. When grown without cold pre-treatment, the same varieties grow vegetatively for extended periods and often fail to flower altogether. Thus, these cereal varieties have a &#x2018;<italic>Kaltbedurfnis</italic>&#x2019;, or cold requirement, that must be met for rapid transition to reproductive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gassner 1918</xref>). Although originally defined as prolonged cold treatment of seeds, vernalization also accelerates flowering when applied to plants during the vegetative growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gott, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flood and Halloran, 1984</xref>).</p>
      <p>Flowering of temperate cereals is also accelerated by long days (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Purvis, 1934</xref>). Studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have shown that the long-day flowering response is controlled by <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kardailsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The FT protein is produced in leaves in long days and transported to the shoot apex to promote reproductive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Corbesier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>FT-like 1</italic> (<italic>TaFT1</italic> in wheat or <italic>HvFT1</italic> in barley) is an orthologue of <italic>FT</italic> likely to fulfil a similar role in temperate cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The requirement for vernalization suppresses the long-day flowering response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This ensures that flowering is delayed before winter, reducing the risk of frost damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mahfoozi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Limin and Fowler, 2006</xref>). Many varieties flower rapidly without vernalization, however, and this natural variation in vernalization requirement has been useful to adapt varieties to warmer growing conditions. Genes controlling natural variation in vernalization requirement have been identified in temperate cereals: <italic>VERNALIZATION1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic>), <italic>VRN2</italic>, and <italic>VRN3</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>; Distalfeld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009).</p>
      <p><italic>VRN1</italic> is a <italic>FRUITFULL</italic>-like MADS box transcription factor that is essential for flowering in temperate cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danyluk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; Preston and Kellog, 2006; Shitsukawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). In varieties that require vernalization, <italic>VRN1</italic> is activated by prolonged exposure to low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danyluk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In other varieties, <italic>VRN1</italic> is expressed without vernalization, reducing or removing the requirement for vernalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danyluk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Mutations in the promoter or deletions within the first intron of the <italic>VRN1</italic> gene are associated with increased <italic>VRN1</italic> expression in these varieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>VRN2</italic>, or <italic>HvVRN2</italic> in barley, is a floral repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Takahashi and Yasuda, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dubcovsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <italic>VRN2</italic> is active in long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karsai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dubcovsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), where it represses <italic>FT1</italic> to delay the long-day flowering response until plants are vernalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>VRN1</italic> represses expression of <italic>VRN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loukoianov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), so when plants are vernalized <italic>VRN1</italic> is likely to repress <italic>VRN2</italic> to allow long-day induction of <italic>FT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations at the <italic>VRN2</italic> locus allow expression of <italic>FT1</italic> without prior vernalization, causing rapid flowering in long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karsai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This requires an active <italic>PHOTOPERIOD1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), which promotes long-day induction of <italic>HvFT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Similarly, dominant alleles of <italic>VRN3</italic> elevate <italic>FT1</italic> expression levels to accelerate flowering and bypass the vernalization requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Faure <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>VRN3</italic> has been mapped to the <italic>FT1</italic> sequence, suggesting that <italic>FT1</italic> is the <italic>VRN3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Dominant <italic>VRN3</italic> alleles in wheat are associated with an insertion in the promoter of the <italic>TaFT1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and, although there is an association between polymorphisms in the <italic>HvFT1</italic> gene and dominant alleles of <italic>VRN3</italic> in barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), the molecular basis for the increased expression of <italic>HvFT1</italic> associated with dominant <italic>VRN3</italic> alleles in barley is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stracke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>In barley plants that lack <italic>HvVRN2</italic>, expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is induced in long days without prior cold treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is also expressed without cold treatment in barleys plants with dominant alleles of <italic>VRN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In these genotypes, <italic>HvFT1</italic> is expressed without prior cold treatment and the FT1 protein might activate <italic>VRN1</italic> through interactions with FD-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li and Dubcovsky, 2008</xref>). It is unclear whether this is a feature of vernalization-induced flowering, where low-temperature induction of <italic>VRN1</italic> precedes long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the potential for low-temperature and long-day activation of <italic>VRN1</italic> complicates analysis of the vernalization response in cereals. For example, although expression of <italic>VRN1</italic> increases in leaves when wheat plants are vernalized in long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; Preston and Kellog 2008), it is unclear whether this is a response to low temperatures or to the combined effects of low temperatures and long days. Analysis of gene expression in plants vernalized in short days has been useful to determine the discrete effects of low temperature on expression of the vernalization genes in cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Zitzewitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dubcovsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), but such studies have not yet examined responses to cold in specific organs.</p>
      <p>The seed vernalization response first investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gassner (1918)</xref> provides an ideal experimental system to resolve the effects of low temperature and daylength cues on expression of flowering-time genes during vernalization-induced flowering. Seeds can be exposed to long cold treatments in darkness then sown in different daylengths. In this study the molecular responses to seed vernalization are examined by assaying the expression of flowering-time genes in different organs during and after seed vernalization.</p>

      <p>Seeds of the winter barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) variety cv. Sonja, or the winter wheat cv. Norstar, were imbibed, planted in foil-covered pots, and exposed to cold treatments of different durations (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 weeks) at 2&#xB1;1&#x2009;&#xB0;C. After 9 weeks in these conditions, plants reached an average coleoptile length of 4&#x2009;cm. At each time point, embryos or germinating seedlings were harvested for RNA extraction and apex dissection. The developing roots and leaves were also isolated after 4 weeks cold treatment. Following cold treatment, seedlings were transferred to glasshouses (temperature at 18&#xB1;2<sup>&#x2009;</sup>&#xB0;C) and grown in either short (8&#x2009;h light/16&#x2009;h dark) or long (16&#x2009;h light/8&#x2009;h dark) days. Supplementary light was provided when natural levels dropped below 200&#x2009;&#x3BC;E.

        <p>Apices were isolated under a binocular dissecting microscope and then digitally photographed on a Leica M8 digital camera. Apex samples included the apex, the base of the apex, and any leaf primordia &lt;0.2&#x2009;mm in length. Leaves were numbered sequentially and plants were grown until the flag leaf emerged to determine FLN. Heading date was measured as the day when the head first emerged from the sheath on the main shoot. FLN and heading date were measured for 9&#x2013;18 plants for each data point. Average FLN and days to heading are presented, and error bars show the standard error (SE).</p>

        <p>Total RNA was extracted using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang <italic>et al.</italic> (1993)</xref>. An oligo(T) primer (T18[G/C/A]) was used to prime first-strand cDNA synthesis from 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g of total RNA using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A single reverse transcription reaction was performed for each RNA sample. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a Rotor-Gene 3000 real-time cycler (Corbett Research). The primers used for <italic>HvVRN1</italic>, <italic>HvVRN2</italic> (<italic>HvZCCTb</italic>), <italic>HvFT1</italic>, <italic>Barley MADS1</italic> (<italic>BM1</italic>), <italic>BM10</italic>, <italic>Hordeum vulgare VEGETATIVE to REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION 2</italic> (<italic>HvVRT2</italic>), and <italic>ACTIN</italic> have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, 2007<italic>b</italic>). For analysis of <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic> expression in wheat (cv. Norstar), the primer sets described above, which are predicted to amplify all three genomes from wheat, were used. The following primers were used for other MADS box genes: <italic>BM3</italic> 5&#x2032;-GCCGTCACCAGCACAAGCAA-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-CCCCATTCACCCTGTAGCAAAGA-3&#x2032;; <italic>BM7</italic> 5&#x2032;-GCTTGACCAGATAGAGAACCAAATAG-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GCTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTCTTGC3&#x2032;; <italic>BM8</italic> 5&#x2032;-CGCACAGCAGCCGACACCTA-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-TGCCTTTGGGGGAGAAGACG-3&#x2032;; and <italic>BM9</italic> 5&#x2032;-TCGTCCTTGAAGCACATTAGAAC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GGGTTCACCAGCAGCATCAAGGG-3&#x2032;. Primer pairs amplify cDNA-specific DNA products. qRT-PCR was performed using Platinum <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Cycling conditions were 4&#x2009;min at 94&#x2009;&#xB0;C, 50 cycles of 10&#x2009;s at 95&#x2009;&#xB0;C, 15&#x2009;s at 60&#x2009;&#xB0;C, and 20&#x2009;s at 72&#x2009;&#xB0;C. This was followed by a melting curve program (72&#x2013;95&#x2009;&#xB0;C with a 5&#x2009;s hold at each temperature). Fluorescence data were acquired at the 72&#x2009;&#xB0;C step and during the melting curve program. Expression levels of genes of interest were calculated relative to <italic>ACTIN</italic> using the comparative quantification analysis method (Rotogene-5; Corbett Research), which takes into account the amplification efficiency of each primer set. Quantification for each primer set and cDNA template combination was performed in quadruplicate, and included a no-template control, to ensure results were not influenced by primer&#x2013;dimer formation or DNA contamination. Data presented are the average and SE from four RT-PCR quantifications (gene of interest versus <italic>ACTIN</italic>) for each RNA sample; each sample was extracted from 30&#x2013;50 apices, 3&#x2013;5 leaves or 3&#x2013;5 seedlings. Similar results were obtained in a second set of samples from the same experiments. Where Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests show that expression levels for a gene of interest differed significantly between two treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6">Figs 2F and 6A, B</xref>), differences of similar significance levels were found in both sample sets.</p>

        <p>In long days, control plants (no cold treatment) flowered within 120&#x2009;d (FLN=20). Plants grown from cold-treated seeds flowered earlier than control plants. Short-term cold treatments accelerated flowering. One week cold treatment reduced FLN to 18, for example, and longer cold treatments further reduced flowering time and FLN. The 9 week cold treatment had the greatest impact on flowering time, reducing the time taken to flower to 47&#x2009;d (FLN=10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Beyond 9 weeks, longer cold treatments had no additional impact on flowering time or FLN (FLN=10 for plants subjected to 11 weeks cold treatment). Thus, 9 weeks cold treatment of seeds completely fulfils the vernalization requirement of this barley (vernalization saturation point).</p>
        <p>Cold treatment of imbibed seeds accelerated flowering by promoting early stages of shoot apex development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), consistent with the reduced FLN of plants grown from cold-treated seeds. The shoot apex remained vegetative at the end of even the longest vernalization treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), so accelerated floral development occurred after vernalization during growth at normal glasshouse temperatures. Shoot apex development was accelerated to a greater extent when vernalized plants were grown in long days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, C</xref>). Stem elongation and post-initiation (double ridge stage, when floral primordia develop at the shoot apex) inflorescence development also occurred rapidly when vernalized plants were grown in long days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In short days, the shoot apex elongated more than in control plants and the apex developed to the double ridge stage, but further inflorescence development and stem elongation occurred slowly. Consequently flowering (head emergence) was delayed in short days in comparison with plants grown in long days, after equivalent vernalization treatment.</p>

        <p>Expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> was assayed during germination at low temperatures (seed vernalization). <italic>HvVRN1</italic> expression was first detected after 4 weeks cold treatment and was induced to higher levels with longer cold treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

Elevated <italic>HvVRN1</italic> transcript levels were maintained during subsequent development at normal glasshouse temperatures.

        <title>The seed vernalization response is similar in wheat and barley.</title>
        <p>To determine whether low temperature and long day cues regulate expression of flowering-time genes in a similar manner in other temperate cereals, expression of <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic> was examined in the winter wheat cultivar Norstar during and after seed vernalization treatments. For these experiments, primers predicted to amplify all three copies (A, B, and D genomes) of the target genes were used, to assay the sum expression levels of <italic>VRN1</italic> or <italic>VRN2</italic>. Seed vernalization promoted flowering in this wheat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp098/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Prolonged cold treatment induced expression of <italic>VRN1</italic> in imbibed wheat seeds, and expression of <italic>VRN1</italic> was maintained in the shoot apex and leaves of wheat plants after vernalization treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A&#x2013;C</xref>). <italic>VRN2</italic> was expressed in leaves in long days, but in vernalized plants expression of <italic>VRN2</italic> in the leaves was lower than in control plants that had not experienced cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref>).

      <p>The molecular responses to seed vernalization parallel those observed in plants vernalized in short days; <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is activated by low temperatures to a degree that correlates with the length of cold treatment, while <italic>HvVRN2</italic> and <italic>HvFT1</italic> are not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Zitzewitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This suggests that the pathways controlling perception of cold in germinating seeds are similar to those in growing plants, and support the hypothesis that activation of <italic>VRN1</italic> mediates the low-temperature flowering response in cereals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p>
      <p>Compared with previous studies using plants vernalized in short days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Zitzewitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), analysis of the vernalization response in seeds has further clarified how <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is regulated. Induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> in seeds occurred in darkness, demonstrating that a low-temperature response pathway can activate expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> independently of light or daylength. This pathway is unlikely to involve <italic>HvVRN2</italic>, which is not expressed in seeds during vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) and is not required for low-temperature induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Similarly, induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is unlikely to involve <italic>HvFT1</italic>, which is not expressed in seeds during vernalization. Low-temperature induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is not limited to any particular organ type in barley seeds/seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Low-temperature induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> at the shoot apex precedes changes in shoot apex morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), and so cannot be a consequence of floral development. Similar observations have been made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> in einkorn wheat plants (<italic>Triticum monococcum</italic>) vernalized in long days. Preston and Kellog (2008) found that in oat (<italic>Avena sativa</italic>) induction of <italic>VRN1</italic> at the shoot apex occurs after vernalization, at the same time as floral development. These conflicting findings might reflect differences between oats versus barley and wheat, or might be due to the different sensitivities of the gene expression analysis techniques used; <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (Preston and Kellog, 2008) versus qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; this study).</p>
      <p>Unlike <italic>HvVRN1</italic>, two related <italic>AP1/FRUITFULL</italic>-like genes, <italic>BM3</italic> and <italic>BM8</italic>, were not activated by seed vernalization. So while the oat (<italic>A. sativa)</italic> orthologue of <italic>BM8</italic>, <italic>AsFUL2</italic>, is induced in leaves when plants are vernalized in long days (Preston and Kellog, 2008), this might not be a general feature of the vernalization response in cereals. Expression of <italic>HvVRT2</italic>, another MADS box gene which has been suggested to play a role in the low-temperature response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), increased slightly during seed vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). This is similar to previous observations in vernalized plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>b</italic></xref>), and it seems unlikely that <italic>HvVRT2</italic> mediates low-temperature induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> in the manner suggested.</p>
      <p>Following vernalization, <italic>HvVRN1</italic> expression levels remained high in the shoot apex and leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This was associated with more rapid inflorescence initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, C</xref>), consistent with genetic data that show that expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> promotes inflorescence initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This might be a specific consequence of elevated <italic>HvVRN1</italic> levels in the shoot apex. Expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is also associated with reduced expression of <italic>HvVRN2</italic> and with induction of <italic>HvFT1</italic> in long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Here it has been shown that down-regulation of <italic>HvVRN2</italic> occurs in leaves, and is a quantitative response; longer cold treatments are associated with greater down-regulation of <italic>HvVRN2</italic>. These findings have also been extended to wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Overall, these data are consistent with the proposed role of <italic>VRN1</italic> in repressing <italic>VRN2</italic> to activate the long-day flowering response in leaves (Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a).</p>
      <p>The main determinant of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> expression levels in the leaves and shoot apices was the length of seed vernalization treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), similar to the response observed in whole plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Zitzewitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trevaskis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Daylength only influenced expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> in the leaves of plants grown from seeds vernalized for 9 weeks, where expression of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> was &#x223C;2-fold higher in long days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This might be caused by elevated expression of <italic>HvFT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), through interactions with FD-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Teper-Bamnolker and Samach, 2005</xref>; Li and Dubcovksy, 2008). Long-day induction of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> in leaves was not critical for inflorescence initiation, which occurred irrespective of daylength in vernalized plants, but might accelerate later stages of inflorescence development.</p>
      <p>In general, the daylength flowering responses of vernalized barley plants are similar to those in rye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Purvis 1934</xref>); prolonged exposure to cold accelerates inflorescence initiation, but long days are required for rapid inflorescence development and for stem elongation. The present findings can explain the molecular events underlying these physiological responses; <italic>HvVRN1</italic> is induced by cold to accelerate inflorescence initiation, then long days induce <italic>HvFT1</italic> and further activate <italic>HvVRN1</italic> to accelerate subsequent stages of inflorescence development and stem elongation.</p>
      <p>In summary, the seed vernalization treatment first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gassner (1918)</xref> provides a simple experimental system to analyse the vernalization response of cereals. Plants are vernalized in the dark, so artificial daylength conditions are not required during vernalization, and vernalized plants are easily matched to non-vernalized control plants at the same stage of development. Analysis of the expression patterns of flowering-time genes during and after seed vernalization supports the hypothesis that activation of <italic>HvVRN1</italic> mediates the low-temperature flowering response in temperate cereals.</p>
