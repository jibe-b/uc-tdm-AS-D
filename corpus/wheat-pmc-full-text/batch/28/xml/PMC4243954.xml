          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The fungus <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> is a necrotrophic pathogen of wheat. It causes disease by secreting proteinaceous effectors which interact with proteins encoded by dominant susceptibility genes in the host. The outcome of these interactions results in necrosis, allowing the fungus to thrive on dead plant material. The mechanisms of these effectors though are poorly understood. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive transcriptomics, proteomic and metabolomic approach to understand how a susceptible wheat cultivar responds to exposure to the <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> effector protein SnTox3.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Microarray and proteomic studies revealed that SnTox3 strongly induced responses consistent with those previously associated with classical host defence pathways including the expression of pathogenicity-related proteins and the induction of cell death. Collapse of the photosynthetic machinery was also apparent at the transcriptional and translational level. SnTox3-infiltrated wheat leaves also showed a strong induction of enzymes involved in primary metabolism consistent with increases in hexoses, amino acids and organic acids as determined by primary metabolite profiling. Methionine and homocysteine metabolism was strongly induced upon exposure to SnTox3. Pathogenicity in the presence of homocysteine was inhibited confirming that the compound has a role in plant defence. Consistent with the strong defence responses observed, secondary metabolite profiling revealed the induction of several compounds associated with plant defence, including the phenylpropanoids chlorogenic acid and feruloylquinic acid, and the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. Serotonin did not accumulate subsequent to SnTox3 infiltration.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>These data support the theory that the SnTox3 effector protein elicits a host cell death response to facilitate the pathogen&#x2019;s necrotrophic infection cycle. Our data also demonstrate that the mechanism of SnTox3 appears distinct from the previously characterised <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> effector SnToxA. Collectively, this comprehensive analysis has advanced our understanding of necrotrophic effector biology and highlighted the complexity of effector-triggered susceptibility.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Fungal and bacterial pathogens of plants have been broadly categorised based on their modes of infection and acquisition of nutrients during infection. Classical biotrophic pathogens, such as rusts and mildews, have evolved complex mechanisms and feeding structures to keep their host alive and complete their lifecycles. These pathogens (fungi at least) are typically obligate and host specific. To cause disease, these biotrophic pathogens must avoid the host&#x2019;s innate immune system which detects common pathogen signals such as chitin or flaggelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is achieved through the secretion of effector molecules which interfere with the innate immune system resulting in the pathogen remaining &#x201C;hidden&#x201D; from the plant. Plants though have evolved a second line of defence known as Effector Triggered Immunity (ETI) whereby these specific effector molecules are recognised by host resistance (R) genes leading to localised cell death and suppression of biotrophic growth.</p>
      <p>Necrotrophic pathogens in contrast rapidly kill their host to infect and reproduce. Historically it was assumed that the pathogen secreted lytic and cell wall degrading enzymes to degrade host tissue and release nutrients. Recent studies though have revealed that at least some necrotrophic pathogens hijack the host&#x2019;s own cell death machinery rather than rely solely on lytic enzymes. These pathogens actively secrete effector molecules that are detected by R-like genes to trigger hypersensitive response pathways and initiate cell death. This phenomenon is known as dominant susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The best-described example of dominant susceptibility is that of <italic>Cochliobolus victoriae</italic>, the causal agent of victoria blight of oats. Pathogenic strains synthesize the chlorinated cyclic pentapeptide victorin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Rapid progress in dissecting the mechanism of victorin-induced cell death was possible as <italic>C. victoriae</italic> is also able to infect <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Using the genetic tools available for this model plant, it was demonstrated that the activity of victorin was dependent on LOV1, a protein closely resembling the nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It was more recently shown that the interaction of victorin with LOV1 occurred through its binding to the thioredoxin TRX-h5 leading to a resistance like response and disease susceptibility to <italic>C. victoriae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Based on this, it was proposed that victorin mimics a conventional (biotrophic) effector that elicits a cell death response which can be exploited by the necrotrophic <italic>C. victoriae</italic>. This was the first demonstrated example of a pathogen effector protein interacting with a host R-like protein giving rise to gene-for-gene dominant susceptibility (in contrast to the typically reported dominant resistance).</p>
      <p>Other cases of host-specific necrotrophic effectors are beginning to emerge. For example, <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic>, the causal agent of wheat tan spot, produces the proteinaceous effector ToxA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ToxA is a small (13.2 kDA) secreted protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that leads to necrosis in ToxA-sensitive wheat lines. ToxA is internalised into plant mesophyll cells subsequent to the pathogen penetrating the leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and interacts with the chloroplast-localized protein ToxA-BP1 leading to collapse of photosynthesis, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventually to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As demonstrated with victorin, ToxA is indirectly recognised by an NBS-LRR protein named Tsn1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Transcriptomic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], proteomic and metabolomic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] analyses of ToxA-triggered responses in wheat have shown that ToxA invokes a variety of host responses including the induction of defence.</p>
      <p>The wheat pathogen <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> is another necrotroph shown to infect through a gene-for-gene mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>S. nodorum</italic> has emerged as one of the model organisms for studying plant &#x2013; necrotrophic pathogen interactions due to its genetic tractability and extensive functional genomics resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Three proteinaceous effectors, SnToxA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], SnTox1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and SnTox3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have recently been identified and are required for disease. <italic>SnToxA</italic> was first identified through the sequencing of the <italic>S. nodorum</italic> genome. The nucleotide sequence was found to be almost identical to <italic>ToxA</italic> from <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> and subsequent analysis has provided strong evidence that <italic>SnToxA</italic> was laterally transferred from <italic>S. nodorum</italic> to <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> shortly prior to 1940 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recent mode-of-action analyses have proven that SnToxA and ToxA share identical functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>The second effector gene identified in <italic>S. nodorum</italic> was <italic>SnTox3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The protein is encoded by a 693-bp intron-free gene that shares no homology to other proteins. Expression of <italic>SnTox3</italic> in <italic>S. nodorum</italic> is induced during the early infection stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is synthesized as a prepropeptide and cleavage of the signal peptide and the prosequence leads to maturation of the small (18&#xA0;kDa) effector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Three disulfide bridges formed by six cysteine residues in SnTox3 are essential for structure and function of the effector protein. QTL analysis has shown that two homoeologous wheat susceptibility genes, <italic>Snn3-B1</italic> and <italic>Snn3-D1</italic>, are involved in SnTox3 sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>As part of a larger study in our laboratory to understand the roles and mechanisms of necrotrophic effectors, we are using functional genomics tools to identify the pathways and mechanisms these effectors exploit to cause disease. Unlike <italic>C. vitoriae</italic>, <italic>S. nodorum</italic> is strictly host specific for wheat and does not infect <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, thus the genetic resources for dissecting the mechanisms of SnToxA and SnTox3 are limited. In this study, gene expression, protein abundance and metabolite levels have all been examined in susceptible wheat infiltrated with SnTox3. This approach has identified a number of key host pathways that are involved in symptom development upon exposure to SnTox3 and provided further insight into the complex <italic>S. nodorum-</italic>wheat interaction.</p>

For transcriptome and proteome analysis, the dialyzed supernatants were further purified using PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) and water as eluate.</p>
        <p>For metabolome experiments, the dialysed and resuspended culture supernatants were diluted 1:2 in freshly prepared 2&#xD7; binding buffer (20&#xA0;mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 500&#xA0;mM NaCl, 20&#xA0;mM imidazole pH&#xA0;7.4).

        <p>13&#xA0;day-old seedlings were syringe-infiltrated with dialyzed SnTox3 or empty vector-control. Samples for microarray analysis were collected in biological triplicates at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hpi and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma) and the quality analysed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 with an Agilent RNA 600 Nano Kit. Labelling and hybridisation to Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome arrays was performed at the Ramaciotti Centre for Gene Function Analysis. The resulting data files are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI (Accession number GSE59723).</p>
        <p>Following microarray hybridizations, CEL files were imported into Partek Genomics Suite Version 6.3 (Partek, St Louis, Missouri, USA) using the following parameters: Pre-background Adjustment: Adjust for GC Content; Background Correction: RMA Background Correction; Quantile Normalization: Quantile Normalization; Log Probes using Base: 2; Probeset Summarization: Mean. Microarray quality was assessed by a PCA plot and the quality-control metrics implemented in Partek Genomics Suite. Based on these, the quality of all array hybridizations was assessed as acceptable.

        <p>For the identification of differentially expressed genes, SnTox3 was expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and purified from culture supernatants. Supernatants of empty vector-transformed yeast cultures served as control. 13&#xA0;day-old seedlings of the wheat variety BG220 harbouring the susceptibility gene Snn3 were infiltrated with purified SnTox3 and the empty vector control (ev) (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).

        <p>Affymetrix microarray analysis was undertaken at six, 12, 24 and 48 hpi to analyse the gene expression in wheat upon SnTox3 exposure.

        <p>The differentially regulated probe sets were analysed using MapMan to classify gene functions (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The majority of probe sets could not be assigned to a functional category. Ninety-eight probe sets associated with photosynthesis showed down-regulation at all time points consistent with the visible collapse of plant tissue and chlorosis upon SnTox3 infiltration. Twelve probe sets were up-regulated at the same timpoints. Genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism showed induction at all time points. Probe sets grouped into the MapMan bins &#x2018;Signalling&#x2019;, &#x2018;Stress&#x2019;, &#x2018;Redox state regulation&#x2019; and &#x2018;Cell wall&#x2019; were also up-regulated, indicating the induction of plant defence responses.</p>
        <p>Many genes typically associated with plant defence responses showed strong induction 24 and 48 hpi (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of the 25 probe sets with the highest fold change induced at both 24 and 48 hpi, 19 were involved in plant defence mechanisms including PR proteins and components of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and phenylpropanoid pathways. Induction of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis seems to be among the initial defence responses. Of the 30 probe sets differentially regulated at 12 hpi, eight encode for phenylalanine ammonia lyases which catalyse the first committed enzymatic reaction of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Expression of these probe sets remained highly induced (up to 70-fold induction) throughout the time course.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>SnTox3 induces expression of plant defence responses</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th><bold>Probe set ID</bold></th><th><bold>Fold-change 24 hpi</bold></th><th><bold>Fold- change 48 hpi</bold></th><th><bold>Annotation</bold></th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.278.1.s1_x_at</td><td>35.124</td><td>168.094</td><td>expressed protein</td><td rowspan="2">PR-1</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.278.1.s1_at</td><td>28.26</td><td>151.169</td><td>expressed protein</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>TaAffx.15327.1.s1_at</td><td>45.891</td><td>193.677</td><td>glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase GII precursor, putative, expressed</td><td rowspan="3">PR-2</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.20121.1.s1_x_at</td><td>19.018</td><td>76.22</td><td>glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase, acidic isoform precursor, putative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.28.1.s1_at</td><td>28.122</td><td>129.871</td><td>glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase, acidic isoform precursor, putative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.21342.1.s1_x_at</td><td>30.836</td><td>158.506</td><td>basic endochitinase 1 precursor, putative, expressed</td><td rowspan="3">PR-3</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.2784.1.a1_at</td><td>12.926</td><td>100.179</td><td>acidic endochitinase Q precursor, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.14946.1.s1_at</td><td>23.018</td><td>79.238</td><td>acidic endochitinase Q precursor, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.9226.1.s1_at</td><td>33.843</td><td>199.463</td><td>win2 precursor, putative, expressed</td><td>PR-4</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.24501.1.s1_at</td><td>21.754</td><td>75.609</td><td>thaumatin-like protein precursor, putative, expressed</td><td rowspan="2">PR-5</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.23322.1.s1_s_at</td><td>15.541</td><td>72.758</td><td>protein P21, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.13371.1.s1_at</td><td>23.75</td><td>81.92</td><td>Bowman-Birk type bran trypsin inhibitor precursor, putative, expressed</td><td>PR-6</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.169.1.s1_x_at</td><td>33.72</td><td>78.158</td><td>germin-like protein 2b</td><td>PR-15</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.8447.1.s1_a_at</td><td>28.453</td><td>131.591</td><td>cytochrome P450 76C2, putative, expressed</td><td rowspan="4">cyto-chrome P450</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.8447.1.s1_x_at</td><td>23.447</td><td>66.609</td><td>cytochrome P450 76C2, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.22615.1.s1_at</td><td>23.678</td><td>130.487</td><td>cytochrome P450 71D6, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>TaAffx.109794.1.s1_at</td><td>32.04</td><td>72.503</td><td>cytochrome P450 76C1, putative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.21307.1.s1_x_at</td><td>89.44</td><td>116.551</td><td>peroxidase 12 precursor, putative, expressed</td><td rowspan="4">phenyl-propanoid pathway</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.22564.2.s1_a_at</td><td>59.78</td><td>79.389</td><td>peroxidase precursor, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.82.1.s1_at</td><td>57.636</td><td>77.723</td><td>peroxidase precursor, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.7022.1.s1_s_at</td><td>66.367</td><td>72.208</td><td>phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.30827.1.a1_x_at</td><td>20.382</td><td>78.043</td><td>jasmonate-induced protein, putative, expressed</td><td rowspan="2">jasmonic acid</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.23763.1.s1_at</td><td>39.084</td><td>80.337</td><td>lipoxygenase 1, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ta.23327.1.s1_at</td><td>37.873</td><td>101.178</td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>TaAffx.26815.1.s1_at</td><td>74.671</td><td>88.734</td><td>NA</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

Of the 93 probe sets on the microarray chip encoding for receptor-like kinases (RLK), 22 (24%) were up-regulated at 24 and 48 hpi. Among the differentially regulated kinases, 13 probe sets (coding for 10 genes) were highly induced with a fold change greater than 10.

        <title>Proteome profiling of SnTox3-treated leaves reveals significant changes in primary metabolism and photosynthetic proteins</title>
        <p>iTRAQ-based proteomics was used to identify changes to the wheat leaf proteome subsequent to SnTox3 exposure. 172 wheat proteins were identified as being differentially abundant at at least one time point in SnTox3-infiltrated plants compared to empty vector controls (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05, average fold change&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.83 and&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1.2 for down- and up-regulated proteins, respectively; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). 143 of these proteins have a known annotation, and for 135, a function could be predicted (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). BLAST searches were performed to identify corresponding microarray probe sets coding for the regulated proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plexdb.org/">www.plexdb.org</ext-link>). For 105 proteins (61%), no change in transcript abundance was identified subsequent to SnTox3 exposure justifying the proteomics approach to identify differentially regulated processes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>SnTox3-induces changes in protein abundance.

        <p>Many (35%) of the repressed proteins were predicted to be involved in photosynthesis (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Several enzymes involved in primary metabolism were more abundant in SnTox3-treated plants, including enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway. 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was induced 1.4 and 1.5-fold at 24 and 72 hpi, respectively whilst transaldolase was 1.6-fold higher at 72 hpi. Two glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase (&#xD7;1.4 at 48 hpi) and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (&#xD7;1.5 at 72 hpi) were also present at higher levels after SnTox3 infiltration, whilst fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC: 4.1.2.13) showed slightly reduced protein levels (&#xD7;0.82 at 72 hpi).</p>
        <p>There were other notable changes identified through this proteomics approach. 3-Ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, catalysing the last enzymatic step in &#x3B2;-oxidation, was significantly more abundant at 48 and 72 hpi (&#xD7;2.0 and 1.3, respectively) indicating increased lipid catabolism. Phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase, a key enzyme of the shikimate pathway, was also significantly more abundant (&#xD7;1.5) subsequent to SnTox3 infiltration (48 hpi) suggesting an induction in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Other proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis were less abundant. Expression of the enzymes diaminopimelate decarboxylase (lysine), 2-isopropylmalate synthase (leucine) and ketol-acid reductoisomerase (valine, leucine and isoleucine) were repressed during the latter stages of SnTox3 treatment. It was also observed that the abundance of the PtrToxA binding protein ToxABP1 (Q5XUV3_WHEAT) was significantly decreased after SnTox3 treatment with a fold change of 0.713.</p>
        <p>The process of iTRAQ data acquisition leads to an underestimation of true iTRAQ ratios, (for example true fold changes of 1.5, 2 and 3 were found to correspond to detected fold changes of approximately 1.3, 1.5 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]) thus we can conclude that the biological fold-changes are likely larger than the observed iTRAQ ratios reported here (please refer to Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for further details).</p>

        <title>SnTox3 induces methionine metabolism</title>
        <p>Careful scrutiny of both the microarray and proteomics data revealed a striking impact on the methionine biosynthetic pathway upon infiltration with SnTox3 (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Expression of a probe set encoding a cysteine synthase was 3.7 fold induced upon SnTox3-infiltration. Enzymes catalysing the recycling of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate were also up-regulated at the transcriptional and translational level. 4 probe sets encoding for serine hydroxymethyl transferases were induced (&#xD7;2.5-2.9) as was the expression of methylene THF reductase genes (&#xD7;2.2 and 4.1) leading to higher abundance of the protein (&#xD7;1.6). The second enzyme involved in methionine production is 5-methyl tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine methylase. Eight probe sets coding for this enzyme showed strong up-regulation in response to SnTox3 (&#xD7;3.4-14.1), whilst the abundance of two of the resulting proteins was also increased (&#xD7;2.0 and 2.6).

        <p>Adenosylmethionine synthase, which catalyses the reaction from methionine to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), responded positively at the transcriptional (&#xD7;2.5-3.2) and translational level (&#xD7;2.0) upon SnTox3 exposure. The expression of adenosylhomocysteinase was also induced by SnTox3 (&#xD7;2.6 fold).

        <p>Given this striking up-regulation of the homocysteine metabolism, we analysed whether or not it played a role in disease development. Detached wheat leaves were inoculated with <italic>S. nodorum</italic> in the presence or absence of 300&#xA0;&#x3BC;M homocysteine and scored for disease seven days later (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the absence of homocysteine, large necrotic lesions were evident one week post inoculation. In the presence of homocysteine, the severity of the lesions was significantly less with many of the replicates failing to develop large necrotic lesions. In many instances, only mild chlorosis or necrotic flecking was evident suggesting that the presence of homocysteine was inhibitory to disease development. The severity of the symptoms in leaves treated with homocysteine was significantly lower than untreated controls as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test (p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01046). To determine if this effect on growth by homocysteine was <italic>in planta</italic> specific, the growth of <italic>S. nodorum</italic> was measured in vitro in varying concentrations of homocysteine. No effect on growth was observed suggesting that the reduction in pathogenicity was not directly due to the increased homocysteine levels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>), but more likely to enhanced downstream responses such as ethylene signalling and/or defence compound synthesis.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Exposure of</bold><bold><italic>S. nodorum</italic></bold><bold>to homocysteine during infection leads to reduced virulence.

        <title>Primary metabolite profiling demonstrates an accumulation of sugars and organic acids in SnTox3-treated wheat</title>
        <p>Gas chromatography&#x2013;mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify metabolites whose abundance is influenced by SnTox3. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the GC-MS data demonstrated clustering of the biological replicates verifying the experimental design and robustness of the method. The largest variation was represented by principal component 1 (PC1) which accounted for 37% of the variance in the data set distinguishing the 48 and 72 hpi SnTox3-infiltrated samples from controls and earlier time points (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A).

        <p>In order to determine significant metabolite changes in wheat induced by SnTox3, we performed univariate and multivariate statistical analyses on the GC-MS dataset (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Thirty-nine mass features were identified to be significantly altered in SnTox3-treated wheat relative to the control; 30 of these increased in abundance. Putative metabolite identifications were established by searching the Golm Metabolome Database and the NIST08 library with 16 confirmed with an in-house database. The remaining metabolites were unidentified.</p>
        <p>A number of sugars showed an increased abundance in SnTox3-infiltrated plants including hexoses, pentoses and di- and tri-saccharides. Fructose, glucose, galactose and ribose demonstrated the largest fold changes (4&#x2013;5) at 48 and 72 hpi. Glyceric acid, malic acid, 2-keto-gluconic acid and erythronic acid were more abundant in SnTox3 infiltrated plants, while N-acetylglutamic acid was less abundant. An unidentified compound with a retention time of 31.4&#xA0;minutes showed the largest change of 11 fold higher in SnTox3 infiltrated plants at 72 hpi.</p>
        <p>A comparable approach was also undertaken to analyse the metabolite content of the apoplast in SnTox3-infiltrated wheat (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The majority of the metabolites that were more abundant subsequent to SnTox3 infiltration were organic acids, sugars and amino acids. All of the identified sugars including sucrose, glucose, fructose and raffinose were all more abundant in SnTox3-infiltrated wheat over the time course as were all three identified amino acids, glutamine, threonine and serine. The largest abundance changes at four hpi were observed for glutamic acid and glucopyranose, which increased 3&#x2013;4 fold in response to SnTox3. The largest significant decrease in a metabolite at four hpi was pyruvic acid, which decreased 2 fold. At 72&#xA0;hours the largest increases of 5&#x2013;6 fold were seen in glutamic acid, citric acid and quinic acid. At 72&#xA0;hours, the largest decreases in metabolites in SnTox3 wheat were all unknown metabolites. Cytosolic contamination of the apoplast samples was negligible as determined by assaying for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Three effector proteins from the wheat pathogen <italic>S. nodorum</italic> have been identified recently, SnToxA, SnTox1 and SnTox3. With the exception of SnToxA (also present in <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic>), these proteins are unique to <italic>S. nodorum</italic> and are of unknown function. In this study, we have taken the approach of analysing how the host responds to SnTox3 exposure at the transcript, protein and metabolite levels. It was not the intention of this manuscript to undertake a complete system biology analysis of this system and deliberately link the data from each of these approaches. Rather, these analyses were chosen for their complementarity and capacity to reveal different aspects of the interaction of the effector protein and the susceptible host. For example, the microarray approach provides a rapid overview of gene expression in a particular sample at a given time. However, previous studies have demonstrated that gene expression and protein abundance don&#x2019;t always correlate and thus it was also important to consider protein abundances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Lastly, we looked at the metabolome of the infiltrated wheat leaves to gain an understanding of the host metabolic status subsequent to SnTox3 infiltration in addition to identifying potential key defence compounds.</p>
      <p>Metabolomic analysis revealed significant increases in hexoses in response to SnTox3. This in itself is intriguing, as it could have been expected that the significant down-regulation observed in photosynthesis would have lead to lower hexose levels. However, this reduction could be compensated by induction of respiratory metabolism and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Induction of the latter was apparent at the transcriptional and translational level. Metabolomic analysis revealed an increase of intracellular ribose and fructose-6-phosphate suggesting that SnTox3-treatment may result in an increased flux through the non-oxidative phase of the PPP. Additionally, probe sets coding for glycolytic enzymes showed induced expression levels. The SnTox3 induced accumulation of sucrose, fructose and glucose are likely to fuel these reactions. The TCA cycle intermediates malic acid and citric acid were more abundant in leaf and apoplast samples at 72 hpi.</p>
      <p>It has been previously described that elevated hexose levels may trigger the induction of plant defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Increased hexose levels have also been observed in incompatible biotrophic interactions suggesting that sugars fuel successful plant defence responses likely through the production of secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Increases in hexoses have been shown to up-regulate expression of genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Indeed, our metabolite profiling demonstrated the accumulation of the phenylpropanoids feruloylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid has inhibitory effects against bacterial and fungal pathogens and is suggested to interfere with cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The activity of feruloylquinic acid may lie in the hydrolysis of this ester to release quinic acid and ferulic acid. Ferulic acid is implicated in resistance to a number of fungal pathogens including <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]<italic>.</italic> SnTox3 also induced an increase in quinic acid, although ferulic acid was not detected.</p>
      <p>The putatively identified cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin also increased in response to SnTox3. This was one of the first secondary metabolite changes identified and therefore has significant potential to impact the outcome of an <italic>S. nodorum</italic> infection. Cyanogenic glycosides are found in over 2,500 plant species and act as successful herbivore deterrents and are also correlated with pathogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Compartmentalized within host cells to avoid self-toxicity, cyanogenic glycosides are cleaved upon tissue disruption releasing toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Interestingly, intact cyanogenic glycosides have also demonstrated activity in barley where they are implicated in host recognition by the pathogen <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>hordei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Many crop plants are cyanogenic including sorghum, wheat, barley, and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Dhurrin was originally discovered in sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and has also been reported in other members of the Poacaeae including <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] but there have been no reports of its activity or presence in wheat since.</p>
      <p>Signalling elements typically observed during plant defence were also evident subsequent to SnTox3 infiltration. Transcriptome analysis revealed that several probe sets coding for MAP kinases were induced by SnTox3. The role of MAP kinases in plant defence responses has been studied extensively and they play a crucial role in the establishment of PAMP-triggered immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Among them is TaMPK3, whose expression is significantly induced at 24 hpi and 48 hpi (fold change 8.0 and 6.3, respectively). TaMPK3 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally induced by the necrotrophic effector PtrToxA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and to be activated during interactions with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Interestingly, TaMPK3 expression precedes necrotic symptom development and shows peak expression levels just before the appearance of macroscopic symptoms for SnTox3 and PtrToxA infiltrations as well as the <italic>Z. tritici</italic> infection suggesting that it is involved in the regulation of PCD onset.</p>
      <p>A striking observation from both the transcriptomics and proteomics data was the up-regulation of methionine metabolism subsequent to SnTox3 infiltration. One consequence of this is likely to be an increase in the levels of homocysteine and SAM. SAM is a direct precursor for ethylene biosynthesis and primary methyl donor for a variety of defence-related metabolites. Its methyl group is consumed in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids such as feruloylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Phenylpropanoids can also act as phytoalexins, phytoanticipans and signalling molecules inducing plant defence gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Additionally, decarboxylated SAM donates propylamine groups during biosynthesis of polyamines including spermine and spermidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Transgenic lines of tomato overproducing spermidine are more susceptible to the necrotrophic fungus <italic>B. cinerea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] whilst spermine has been shown to induces expression of PR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>
      <p>It has also been reported that homocysteine levels are higher in potato infected with <italic>Phytopthora infestans</italic>, especially in susceptible potato genotypes at the later stages of the disease. Furthermore, infiltration of leaves with homocysteine results in quicker and more severe disease progression in susceptible plants suggesting that homocysteine is playing a role in accelerating host cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and highlighting the potential role for homocysteine and/or potential downstream responses for influencing plant-pathogen interactions.</p>
      <p>Together, the above examples indicate that an increase in the metabolism of methionine through homocysteine plays a role in host defence, possibly through multiple mechanisms. Our data here also suggests such a role for the <italic>S. nodorum</italic> &#x2013;wheat interaction. The elevation of many of the transcripts and proteins associated with the methionine cycle after SnTox3 treatment correlates with the increase in the other observed defence responses (e.g. PR proteins and secondary metabolism). Furthermore, the ability <italic>S. nodorum</italic> to cause disease was hindered in the presence of increased levels of homocysteine suggesting that it, or its metabolism, plays an as yet undiscovered role role in host defence.</p>
      <p>These data though raise the question of how does <italic>S. nodorum</italic> deal with these defence responses during infection? There are two possibilities. Firstly, the rate of the infection outpaces the defence responses allowing the pathogen to sporulate prior to inhibition. It could perhaps be speculated that the increasing defence responses are a signal for the pathogen to sporulate. Another possibility may be that the pathogen suppresses these defence responses during infection, as commonly occurs in biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens. A previous study by our laboratory has evidence to support this. During exposure to purified SnToxA, high levels of serotonin were seen to accumulate in susceptible wheat lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It was demonstrated that serotonin strongly inhibited the ability of the pathogen to asexually sporulate. However, when the same lines were infected with <italic>S. nodorum</italic>, the serotonin levels were 10-fold decreased suggesting that the pathogen has mechanisms for suppressing plant defences during infection. The mechanisms behind this are currently unclear, however it wouldn&#x2019;t be unexpected that one (or more) of the many small secreted proteins encoded in the <italic>S. nodorum</italic> genome could have a role in defence suppression. Indeed recent studies have identified that <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> suppresses host immunity by hijacking host RNA interference pathways using small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p>
      <p>Comparable host analyses studies have been previously published for ToxA from both <italic>S. nodorum</italic> and <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. A comparison of the SnToxA and SnTox3 datasets revealed several significant differences including signalling and primary metabolism changes in the host. There is also evidence to suggest that whilst both effectors may lead to collapse of photosynthesis, they do so through different means. SnTox3 leads to down-regulation of the light reaction (particularly photosystem I, ATP synthase) whilst SnToxA has a higher impact on the Calvin cycle potentially leading to feedback inhibition of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p>
      <p>Perhaps one of the most interesting differences when comparing the plant response to SnTox3 and SnToxA was on secondary metabolism. SnToxA strongly induced the tryptophan pathway as evident from microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Metabolome analysis detected significant increases in tryptophan, serotonin, two serotonin derivatives and the benzoxazinoid 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA) synthesized from the tryptophan precursor indole-3-glycerolphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In contrast to this, SnTox3 infiltration resulted in no increase in any of the tryptophan pathway metabolites and this was consistent with microarray data showing a significantly lower number of tryptophan pathway genes induced compared to SnToxA. Instead SnTox3 appears to induce the phenylpropanoid pathway as evident from our microarray analysis and the detection of the secondary metabolites feruloylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid suggesting that whilst SnToxA and SnTox3 both result in host cell death in susceptible wheat lines, each interaction is causal to other independent events, possibly indicative of other functions.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, these data have identified many interesting pathways and processes in the host associated with exposure to the SnTox3 protein and highlight the almost paradoxical nature of the wheat-<italic>S. nodorum</italic> this interaction. The necrotrophic effectors secreted by <italic>S. nodorum</italic> result in host cell death through their interaction with dominant susceptibility loci. The cell death provides the environment for the necrotroph to derive nutrients and thrive prior to asexual development. However the effectors studied thus far also trigger a strong defence response (probably due to the host cell death or events leading to it). Studies are now underway to better understand how the pathogen copes with and/or suppresses the accumulation of defence proteins and metabolites. However we now need to functionally characterise some of these processes and determine precisely what role they have in disease.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The study of necrotrophic pathogens has come-of-age. Until recently, necrotrophs were often considered crude and simplistic pathogens that were reliant on a battery of lytic enzymes to degrade host tissue for nutrient release. However, we now understand that some necrotrophic pathogens are more complex and subtle than originally thought. Seminal studies on victorin from <italic>Cochliobolus victoriae</italic> and also rapid progress on ToxA from <italic>S. nodorum</italic> and <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> have highlighted the gene-for-gene nature that exists in these interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We now understand that these effectors have evolved to be recognised in order to facilitate pathogen growth <italic>in planta</italic>.</p>
      <p>This study advances this necrotrophic gene-for-gene concept by revealing how wheat responds to exposure to the SnTox3 effector from <italic>S. nodorum</italic>. As the pathogen is strictly host specific for wheat, we are limited in this system in terms of resources available in dissecting the host in this interaction (e.g. T-DNA lines etc. aren&#x2019;t available). Consequently studies such as this are important in building our fundamental base of understanding diseases such as this on non-model hosts. The success of this approach has been demonstrated through the recent discovery of the phyotalexin serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is thought that the primary role of these effectors (SnTox3 and ToxA) is to induce cell death through the stimulation of existing defence pathways. The recent discovery of the Tsn1, an R-like susceptibility gene for ToxA supports this theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, whilst the pathogen thrives from the nutrient release resulting from host cell death, it must also survive these resulting defence responses. Indeed, a previous study from this laboratory has identified that <italic>S. nodorum</italic> is able to limit the accumulation of serotonin induced upon ToxA exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Studies are now underway to dissect the pathogen mechanisms for coping with these defence responses during infection.</p>
