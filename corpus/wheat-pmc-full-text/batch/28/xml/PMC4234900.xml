          <title>Background</title>
          <p>High temperature (heat) stress during grain filling is a major problem in most of the wheat growing areas. Developing heat tolerant cultivars has become a principal breeding goal in the Southern and Central Great Plain areas of the USA. Traits associated with high temperature tolerance can be used to develop heat tolerant cultivars in wheat. The present study was conducted to identify chromosomal regions associated with thylakoid membrane damage (TMD), plasmamembrane damage (PMD), and SPAD chlorophyll content (SCC), which are indicative of high temperature tolerance.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In this study we have reported one of the first linkage maps in wheat using genotype by sequencing SNP (GBS-SNP) markers to extreme response to post anthesis heat stress conditions. The linkage map was comprised of 972 molecular markers (538 Bin, 258 AFLPs, 175 SSRs, and an EST). The genotypes of the RIL population showed strong variation for TMD, SCC and PMD in both generations (F<sub>10</sub> and F<sub>9</sub>). Composite interval mapping identified five QTL regions significantly associated with response to heat stress. Associations were identified for PMD on chromosomes 7A, 2B and 1D, SCC on 6A, 7A, 1B and 1D and TMD on 6A, 7A and 1D. The variability (R<sup>2</sup>) explained by these QTL ranged from 11.9 to 30.6% for TMD, 11.4 to 30.8% for SCC, and 10.5 to 33.5% for PMD. Molecular markers <italic>Xbarc113</italic> and AFLP AGCTCG-347 on chromosome 6A, <italic>Xbarc121</italic> and <italic>Xbarc49</italic> on 7A, <italic>gwm18</italic> and Bin1130 on 1B, Bin178 and Bin81 on 2B and Bin747 and Bin1546 on 1D were associated with these QTL.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Wheat is one of the most widely grown cereals globally. It possesses some adaptive plasticity which is the ability to exhibit some phenotypic change in responses to environmental conditions (i.e. high temperature). Even though there is adaptive plasticity, terminal heat stress has become a common limiting factor for almost all wheat grown in temperate regions, which accounts for 40% (36 million ha) of the total wheat production in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The southern Great Plains of the USA is a temperate environment and accounts for 30-40% of US wheat production and often experiences temperatures of 32-35&#xB0;C during grain filling stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Exposure to higher than optimum temperatures at this stage decreases yield and quality of wheat grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to Wardlaw et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], every 1&#xB0;C rise above 15&#xB0; to 20&#xB0;C can cause a 3% to 4% yield reduction. Paulsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported that temperatures of 32&#xB0; to 38&#xB0;C can decrease wheat yield by 50% or more. The annual occurrence of moderate heat stress, accompanied by periodic extreme heat stress, prevents wheat from reaching its actual yield potential in these temperate regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Thermotolerance is a well-known adaptive phenomenon, which is induced by a short acclimation period at moderately high temperatures or by treatment with other non-lethal stress prior to subsequent heat stress. In the field, thermotolerance occurs under natural conditions and the effect of thermotolerance is an inherent component of heat tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Though high temperature is a frequently occurring phenomenon, relatively little is known about the critical genes controlling heat tolerance in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To maintain growth and productivity, plants must adapt to stress conditions and exercise specific tolerance mechanisms. The alteration of various photosynthetic attributes under heat stress is a good indicator of heat tolerance as they show correlation with growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Injury to the photosystem can limit plant growth. Chlorophyll fluorescence, an indicator of photosystem II activity and thylakoid membrane damage, have been shown to correlate with heat tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has been reported that wheat genotypes with higher variable fluorescence (F<sub>v</sub>) have higher yield potential. Maximum (F<sub>m</sub>), base (F<sub>0</sub>), variable fluorescence (F<sub>v</sub>), and half-time between F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>m</sub> have been reported to have strong genetic correlation with grain yield of durum wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Plasma membrane stability (also called cell membrane thermostability), which is the reciprocal of plasma membrane damage, is related to cellular thermotolerance. Increased permeability of membranes is evidenced by increased loss of electrolytes, an indication of decreased membrane stability and has been used as an indirect measure of heat-stress tolerance in diverse plant species, including wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> L. Moench) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Membrane thermostability has been reported to have a strong genetic correlation with grain yield in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Marsh et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found a large portion of the variability for membrane stability to be controlled by a small number of genes. Heritability of membrane thermostability in maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) was estimated to be 73% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>In spite of being promoted as a promising breeding tool, the use of membrane thermostability and chlorophyll fluorescence for improvement of thermotolerance in wheat is very limited because of time-consuming and labor intensive field evaluation processes. Membrane stability requires destructive sampling and there is large potential for error inherent in the process of estimating membrane stability. Similarly, measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence require use of expensive instrumentation and, in some cases, necessitates dark adaptation of the leaf tissue, which limits the number of plants that can be screened in a given day. In addition to the complex estimation processes, these traits are influenced by environmental conditions. Thus, improving heat tolerance through traditional breeding methods is difficult. Identification of DNA markers associated with acquired thermotolerance would allow marker assisted selection and increase the efficiency for improving these traits through breeding. In addition, the identification of QTL would be useful in the identification of genes that are important for tolerance to heat stress.</p>
      <p>Heat tolerance is a quantitative trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite its importance, only a few QTL mapping studies have focused on heat tolerance. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found QTL linked to grain filling duration on the short arms of chromosomes 1B and 5A. In addition, QTL for heat tolerance under hot and dry conditions were detected on chromosomes 2B and 5B in a spring wheat population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In another study, conducted under short-term reproductive stage heat stress, several QTL were found on chromosome 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3B, 5A and 6D for heat susceptibility indices of various morphological and yield traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Paliwal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported QTL for thousand grain weight, grain fill duration and canopy temperature depression on chromosome 2B, 7B and 7D, respectively. Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported QTL with significant effects on grain yield, grain weight, grain filling, stay green and senescence associated traits on 2A, 3A, 4A, 6A, 6B and 7A under post-anthesis high temperature stress in wheat. Most of the reported QTL maps have been based on low density SSR and/or AFLP markers. Developing a map with high density molecular markers is needed in order to get a better understanding of the architecture of complex traits. Genotype-by-Sequencing (GBS) is an approach to develop SNP markers which can be used for mapping traits in diverse organisms. This approach is very simple and cost effective and is based on high throughput next generation sequencing. In this method, SNPs are discovered by sequencing a subset of genomic fragments following the use of restriction enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study we used the same population and marker data of Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] along with an additional set of Bin markers (SNPs data from one bin considered as a haplotype and referred to as single SNP) developed by using the Genotype By Sequencing (GBS) approach. The objectives of the present study were to increase the marker density in the population and identify QTLs associated with different traits, thylakoid and plasma membrane and chlorophyll damages, which provide heat tolerance in wheat.</p>

        <p>Ventnor, a hard white Australian wheat, and Karl 92, a hard red winter wheat from Kansas were crossed to develop a recombinant inbred line population (RIL). The pedigree of Ventnor is unknown, while Karl 92, is an F<sub>11</sub> reselection from the cultivar Karl. The pedigree of Karl is PlainsmanV/3/Kaw/Atlas 50//Parker*5/Agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Ventnor has been shown to have superior heat tolerance based on its ability to maintain photosynthetic capacity and kernel weight when exposed to post anthesis heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], while Karl 92 was found moderately sensitive to post anthesis heat stress. The recombinant inbred line population was developed by advancing from the F<sub>2</sub> through single seed descent (SSD) in the greenhouse to generate a set of F<sub>6:7</sub> RILs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The entire population was characterized for thylakoid and plasma membrane damage, and for chlorophyll content in the F<sub>6:9</sub> and F<sub>6:10</sub> generations under optimum (20/15&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#xB0;C&#xA0;day/night temperature) and high temperature stress (36/30&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1&#xB0;C) conditions during the post anthesis stage.</p>
        <p>The plants were grown in a greenhouse at an optimal temperature of 20/15&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#xB0;C&#xA0;day/night temperature with 16&#xA0;h photoperiod and light intensity of 420&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol&#xA0;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xA0;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> approximately. Fertilizer, systematic insecticide, and fungicide were applied as needed to avoid any malnutrition or biotic stresses. Plants were watered as needed to avoid any stress. Each line was planted in six pots with three plants per pot. The primary tiller of each plant was tagged at anthesis and was used for estimating physiological traits. Eight days after anthesis (at full anthesis), plants were transferred to a controlled growth chamber maintained at optimum growth conditions. Due to the genetic variation for anthesis, genotypes were grouped based on their similar anthesis date (&#xB1;1&#xA0;day) and exposed to the high temperature. Once genotypes were moved from the greenhouse to growth chamber, six pots/line were divided into two growth chambers (3 pots/chamber) and chambers were maintained optimum temperature condition (20/15&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1&#xB0;C) for 48&#xA0;h to facilitate adaptation to growth chamber conditions. At ten days after anthesis, one growth chamber was left under optimum temperature conditions, while the plants in the other one were subjected under high temperature stress.</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Heat treatment and physiological characterization</title>
        <p>The controlled chamber was maintained at 20/15&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1&#xB0;C with 16-h photoperiod, and 420&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol&#xA0;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xA0;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> light intensity. On the other hand, the temperature in the high temperature growth chamber was raised from 20/15&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1&#xB0;C to 36/30&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1&#xB0;C with adequate moisture over a 48&#xA0;h period and remained for duration of 10 d. The intensity of light was 420&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol&#xA0;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xA0;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Water was provided to plants as needed in both the control and heat treated conditions. Each of the three pots of a genotype was treated as biological replications. Pots were randomly arranged inside the growth chamber for both the controlled and heat treated conditions.</p>
        <p>Chlorophyll a fluorescence, the ratio of variable (F<sub>v</sub>) to maximum fluorescence (F<sub>m</sub>), was used as an indirect method to assess thylakoid membrane damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> was measured on intact flag leaves one third of the way from the base of the abaxial surface after 1&#xA0;h of dark adaptation. Fluorescence was measured using a pulse modular fluorometer (Model OS5- FL, Opti-Sciences, Hudson, NH, USA) in both the control and heat treated plants at 4-, 7-, and 10-d after heat treatment. In each treatment (control and heat treated growth chamber), F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> was measured from three flag leaves (3 different plants) for each biological replication. An average of three measurements was used to estimate thylakoid membrane damage (TMD). Thylakoid membrane damage (TMD) due to heat stress was assessed by comparing F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> values between control and heat treated plants. The relative damage was estimated as follows: % TMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;[((F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>-heat)-(F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>-control))/(F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>-control)]*100. As the %TMD values were calculated in percentage, to increase homogeneity of the data, the percent values were transformed by Log<sub>2</sub> function. The Log<sub>2</sub> transformed data were used for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p>A self-calibrating SPAD chlorophyll meter (Model 502, Spectrum Technologies, Plainfield, IL) was used to measure chlorophyll content. Chlorophyll content was measured from the same flag leaves and leaf blade areas where fluorescence measurements were taken at 4-, 7-, and 10-d after heat treatment. In each treatment (control and heat treated growth chamber), chlorophyll contents were measured from three flag leaves (3 different plants) for each biological replication. An average of three measurements was used to represent chlorophyll content for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p>Plasma membrane damage (PMD) was assessed using the method described by Ristic and Cass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Leaf disks (diameter&#x2009;=&#x2009;5&#xA0;mm) were collected from two individual flag leaves at two different plants within each biological replication at 7- and 10-d after heat treatment and placed in de-ionized water (4&#xA0;ml) in sealed vials. The vials were stored overnight on a shaker at 5&#xB0;C. Electroconductivity of the aqueous solution was measured with a Metter Toledo (SevenMulti S70) conductivity meter. The tissue samples were then autoclaved. The conductivity of the solution was again measured after storing the samples on a shaker at 5&#xB0;C overnight. The percent electrolyte leakage was calculated based on the conductivity before and after autoclaving. The average value of two flag leaves within each biological replication was used to estimate % PMD. The percent damage was calculated as 100&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;(% leached<sub>h</sub> -% leached<sub>c</sub>)/(X-% leached<sub>c</sub>), where h was stressed, c was control, and &#x2018;X&#x2019; was % leached value corresponding to 100% damage which was assumed to be 100% leached. As the PMD values were calculated in percentage, to increase homogeneity of the data, the percent values were transformed by Log<sub>2</sub> function. The Log<sub>2</sub> transformed data were used for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p>Adjusted mean (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, BLUP) values were estimated for each sampling date of chlorophyll content, log transformed TMD and PMD data across two generations. The estimated adjusted mean values of each sampling date were used for QTL analysis.</p>

The data indicate that the increased exposure to heat stress increases damage to the plasma membrane, thylakoid membrane, and reduces chlorophyll content in the heat stressed plants in both the tolerant and sensitive parents, however, the damage was lower in the tolerant parent than in the sensitive parent (Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Compared to the control, mean TMD values ranged from 12.2% in Ventnor to 32.1% in Karl 92, and mean PMD ranged from 14.3% in the tolerant parent to 42.8% in the sensitive parent (data not presented). The average value of SCC under heat stress (not compared with control) ranged from 43.3 in the tolerant parent to 30.6 in the sensitive parent (data not presented). The mean values for TMD, SCC and PMD in the F<sub>9</sub> and F<sub>10</sub> generations were 21.9% and 24.8%, 38.9% and 36.5%, and 28.6% and 32.9%, respectively (calculated from non-transformed data).

Of the 560 group-forming markers, SSRs accounted for 91, Bin markers accounted for 391 and AFLPs accounted for 78. The rest of the markers were ungrouped, grouped without an SSR (it cannot be assigned to a chromosome), or distorted. Twenty-two linkage groups were identified and covered a total length of 1044&#xA0;cM, with an average interval of 1.86&#xA0;cM between markers. All chromosomes except 5D were represented in the linkage groups. Chromosome 2A and 7D each had two groups. Comparing across genomes, the maximum number of markers mapped to the B genome (45.44%), followed by the A genome (42.68%), and the D genome (11.96%).

      <p>In this research SPAD chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) measurements were used to estimate chlorophyll content and thylakoid membrane damage of heat stressed plants. Loss of chlorophyll content during grain filling was already reported to be associated with reduced yield under the field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Various authors have also found thylakoid and plasma membrane damages were associated with grain yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our study, we found strong correlation among these traits which indicate that these traits might be under pleiotropic genetic control. Despite strong correlations, we found some variability in QTL regions (linkage group 1B and 2B) for these traits along with some common QTLs (linkage group 6A, 7A and 1D). This might be because of polygenic inheritance of those traits, difficulty of estimation of these traits and 25-30% variabilities among these traits which are not common (deduced from Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As a result, measuring more than one trait will provide more precise information. However, considering limited resources in the plant breeding programs, SCC could be used to produce reasonable information for heat tolerance as it showed stronger correlations with PMD and TMD than the correlation between PMD and TMD itself.</p>
      <p>This study was conducted using the same population and marker data of Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], along with an extra set of GBS SNP markers. Present study has developed one of the earliest wheat linkage maps by using GBS SNP marker for QTL study under heat stress conditions. The additional markers, and possibly, the use of different mapping software resulted in some variability in linkage group formation compared to Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The 2A and 6A groups of Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were fused together and were assigned to 6A in this study. They assigned the 2A group based on <italic>Xgwm356</italic> and <italic>Xbarc353</italic>. Those markers have been reported to map to both 2A and 6A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml">http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml</ext-link>). In our study, the additional markers allowed the identification of a single linkage group. Two markers specific to 6A allowed a more accurate chromosomal assignment.</p>
      <p>Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the current study used the same mapping population, but varied in the method of exposing the plants to the stress and to the traits evaluated. We exposed plants to moderate temperature to develop thermotolerance before the chronic heat treatments. However, some QTL regions were common in both studies, though the studies were conducted under different temperature regimes. The similarity of findings increases confidence that these chromosomal regions are truly associated with heat tolerance in this population. These genomic regions might have certain genes which could be manipulated by wheat breeders to improve heat tolerance In our study, five genomic regions (6A, 7A, 1B, 2B and 1D) were significantly associated with traits related to heat tolerance. Of nineteen QTL identified in this study, twelve QTL explained greater than 15% of the phenotypic variability and should be considered as major QTL. Whereas, Vijayalakshmi et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found several QTL on chromosomes (2A, 3A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 3B, 4B, 6B, 7B and 5D ) for different senescence related traits under high temperature stress (32/25&#xB0;C&#xA0;day and night temperature from 10 d after anthesis to physiological maturity). QTL for 75% stay-green on chromosomes 2A and 3B and a region on 2A for 25% stay-green were not found in the current work.</p>
      <p>We observed that the QTL on 1D was associated with all three traits making it a potentially important QTL for heat tolerance. Pinto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported QTL for days to anthesis on 1D under drought and temperate irrigated conditions. This QTL was likely not identified in the Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] study because the markers associated with the trait are new SNPs. The addition of new SNPs might also be the reason we were able to identify QTL on 1B in this study. Pinto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] in their study reported several QTL on 1B including QTL for canopy temperature, yield, and chlorophyll content in the grain filling stage. The 2B QTL was also not identified in the Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] study due to the lack of markers in the region. The only trait associated with 2B in the present study is PMD. It may be that this locus is only associated with membrane stability and not with photosynthetic function. Mason et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported a stable QTL on 2B for heat susceptibility index (HIS) of grain number.</p>
      <p>The QTL identified on chromosome 6A was significant, consistent and co-localized for SCC and TMD across the first two sampling dates (4- and 7- d after heat treatment). Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found two QTL on 2A between <italic>Xgwm356</italic> and CGT.TGCG-349, and between CGT.TGCG-349 and CTCG.ACC-242 for 75% stay-green, 25% stay-green, 50% stay-green, maximum rate of senescence, and time for maximum senescence. Other markers associated with QTL on 2A and 6A in their study were <italic>Xgwm353</italic>, GTGACGT-189, GTGCTA-282 and CGACGCT-173. In our study, chromosome 6A encompasses both 2A and 6A of Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Most of the trait-associated markers from that study are present in the interval region of our putative QTL. As a result, we believe that the QTL on 6A is the same QTL previously identified on 2A and 6A and is associated with stay-green related traits under high temperature.</p>
      <p>The QTL on chromosome 7A was very consistent for all three traits across all the sampling dates with very high LOD values (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Phenotypic variability explained by this QTL was also very high and ranged from 18.86% to 33.51%. It was flanked by marker <italic>Xbarc121</italic> and <italic>Xbarc49</italic>. Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported a QTL on 7A for F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> and time to maximum rate of senescence (TMRS) associated with marker <italic>Xbarc121. Xbarc49</italic> marker was physically mapped to 7A by Sourdille et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] on wheat deletion bin C7AL 1&#x2013;0.39. EST WHE2105_F08_K15ZS was also located in that bin and was found to be similar to the stress responsive gene (<italic>srg6</italic>) in <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> (NCBI). This mRNA is similar to a DNA binding protein in mouse and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This suggests it may act as a regulatory gene for stress response. EST to a WHE0854_F06_L12ZS is in the same bin and showed homology to a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in Maize (NCBI). This gene has a role in stress signal transduction in plants. It also acts as a positive regulator for salt and ABA stress tolerance in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Another EST in that bin, WHE2324_F12_L24ZS, was found to have similarity to a putative DNA topoisomerase I gene in rice. This gene plays a crucial role in stress adaptation of plants by altering gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This region would be of interest for further investigation.</p>
      <p>Aquaporins are membrane-inserted water channel proteins that have been implicated in plant response to heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An analysis of wheat ESTs using the Thermorank program Li and Fang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] showed that aquaporins are relatively heat labile (data not shown). Forrest and Bhave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] physically mapped aquaporin loci in wheat and placed loci all group 2, group 4 and group 6 chromosomes as well as 3D, 5B, 7A and 7B. The aquaporins on 7A mapped to deletion bin 7AS 0&#x2013;0.45 while the markers associated with the QTL in this study mapped to 7AL 0&#x2013;0.31. Therefore, the aquaporins on 7A are not likely to be responsible for the trait. They did, however, map aquaporin genes to the same deletion bin as one of the flanking markers for the 6A QTL in this study (6AS 0&#x2013;0.55). The QTL on 6A affected TMD and SCC but not PMD. The QTL on 2B was associated with PMD and does correspond to the physical region containing aquaporin genes, though the physical region encompasses most of the chromosome. An effort to understand what, if any, role aquaporins play in thermotolerance appears warranted, though it is unlikely to explain the majority of the effects observed in this study.</p>
      <p>The epistatic region of chromosome 7A was found almost 20&#xA0;cM away from the detected QTL of all three traits. This is most likely to be a distinct QTL rather than the existing one. The positive additive effect of that region (55&#xA0;cM) was not significant, might be because of lack of marker information in that region of the linkage group (Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Concomitantly, epistatic region of chromosome 1B (25&#xA0;cM) was found almost 13&#xA0;cM away from the detected QTL of SCC (Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As SCC and PMD were found to be strongly correlated, the epistatic region of chromosome 1B might be different from the detected QTL in this study.</p>
      <p>Transgressive segregation was observed in this population, meaning that both parents contribute alleles to the phenotype. Saadalla et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] observed transgressive segregation for membrane thermostability. Even though there was transgressive segregation in the population, we failed to detect beneficial alleles from the sensitive parent. This could be due to to the smaller size of the population and relatively sparse marker coverage throughout the genome. Only 11.96% of our markers were mapped to the D genome. Most groups in the D genome were small. This might have prevented us from capturing alleles contributed from the sensitive parent.</p>
      <p>The overall level of polymorphism in this population is surprisingly low. This may be attributed to the unknown pedigree of Ventnor, with Australian winter wheat background. Furthermore, it is possible that Ventnor contains US Great Plains wheat derived through international germplasm exchange; if that is the case, the genetic diversity between the two parents would be low.</p>
      <p>In our study, five QTL regions that significantly influenced TMD, SCC and PMD were detected on chromosomes 6A, 7A, 1B, 2B and 1D. The SSR markers <italic>Xbarc121</italic> and <italic>Xbarc49</italic> for all three traits on chromosome 7A, and <italic>gwm18 and Xbarc113</italic> for SCC on chromosome 1B and 6A, respectively were found close to the QTL. Along with the SSRs, five GBS Bin markers <italic>Bin747, Bin 1596, Bin 178, Bin 81</italic> and <italic>Bin 1130</italic> were also found strongly associated with TMD, SCC and PMD. BIN markers have been called from SNPs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and the sequence information of these relevant SNPs can be used for further exploration of marker assisted selection. The AFLP marker, <italic>XCGT.AGCT347</italic> would be a good target for conversion to a more user friendly marker.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Heat tolerance is a complex trait and influenced by different component traits. Our study suggests that membrane damage and chlorophyll content are very closely correlated when plants are exposed to a long period of heat stress, and are most likely under similar genetic control. The neighboring markers in the identified QTL may play an important role in marker assisted breeding for heat tolerance in wheat.</p>

        <title>Future research goals</title>
        <p>The authors realize that it is important to observe the performance of this population under field conditions to validate the findings of this study. However, due to the nature of the population (spring/winter wheat cross), it would be difficult to conduct a validation study under field conditions due to the lack of winter hardiness of RILs, which would result in cold damage to many RILs and would create undesirable variations in the study. Considering this point, authors have initiated a process of transferring these QTL into different winter wheat backgrounds by using the back cross breeding method. Once the backcross populations are developed, their performance will be tested under field conditions and the results will be published in a peer reviewed journal.</p>
