          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) play important roles in regulating the translocation of assimilates from source to sink tissues. Identification and characterization of new <italic>SUT</italic>s in economically important crops such as wheat provide insights into their role in determining seed yield. To date, however, only one <italic>SUT</italic> of wheat has been reported and functionally characterized. The present study reports the isolation and characterization of a new <italic>SUT</italic>, designated as <italic>TaSUT2</italic>, and its homeologues (<italic>TaSUT2A</italic>, <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic>) in hexaploid wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.).</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p><italic>TaSUT2A</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> genes each encode a protein with 506 amino acids, whereas <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> encodes a protein of 508 amino acids. The molecular mass of these proteins is predicted to be&#x2009;~&#x2009;54 kDA. Topological analysis of the amino acid sequences of the three homeologues revealed that they contain 12 transmembrane spanning helices, which are described as distinct characteristic features of glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide cation symporter family that includes all known plant SUTs, and a histidine residue that appears to be localized at and associated conformationally with the sucrose binding site. Yeast SUSY7/<italic>ura3</italic> strain cells transformed with <italic>TaSUT2A</italic>, <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> were able to uptake sucrose and grow on a medium containing sucrose as a sole source of carbon; however, our subcellular localization study with plant cells revealed that TaSUT2 is localized to the tonoplast. The expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> was detected in the source, including flag leaf blade, flag leaf sheath, peduncle, glumes, palea and lemma, and sink (seed) tissues. The relative contributions of the three genomes of wheat to the total expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> appear to differ with tissues and developmental stages. At the cellular level, <italic>TaSUT2</italic> is expressed mainly in the vein of developing seeds and subepidermal mesophyll cells of the leaf blade.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This study demonstrated that TaSUT2 is a new wheat SUT protein. Given that TaSUT2 is localized to the tonoplast and sucrose is temporarily stored in the vacuoles of both source and sink tissues, our data imply that TaSUT2 is involved in the intracellular partitioning of sucrose, particularly between the vacuole and cytoplasm.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Sucrose is the major transported form of sugar in plants. The deposition of starch, which is the main determinant of yield in cereal crops, in seeds is dependent on the supply of this sugar molecule from source tissues through the phloem. The phloem consists of sieve elements (SE) and companion cells (CC) connected by numerous intercellular connections called plasmodesmata and form a SE-CC complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The SE is responsible for long distance transport of sucrose and other organic materials, whereas the CCs supply proteins and energy to the SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Phloem loading and unloading of sucrose takes place symplastically and apoplastically. The symplastic transport involves cell to cell movement of sucrose via plasmodesmatal connections, while the apoplastic transport involves active sucrose movement across membranes via sucrose transporter (SUT) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and mainly takes place in the absence of plasmodesmatal connections. Genes encoding SUTs have been identified from a number of plant species including cereal crops such as rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and form small gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. All the plant SUTs identified to date are members of the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide (GPH) cation symporter family, which is part of the major facilitator superfamily characterized by 12 transmembrane spanning helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the first extracellular loop of plant SUTs contains a histidine residue, such as His-65 of the Arabidopsis SUT1 that serves as a target for diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) mediated inhibition of sucrose transport activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It has been shown that this residue is substrate protected from the inhibition reaction induced by DEPC. This along with the ability of eliminating SUTs&#x2019; sensitivity to DEPC by substituting histidine with other amino acids without affecting the transport activity of SUTs indicate that the DEPC sensitive histidine residue is localized at or associated conformationally with the sucrose binding site.</p>
      <p>Spatiotemporal expression analyses of the <italic>SUT</italic>s in cereal crops have provided insights into their physiological roles during seed development. For example, <italic>SUT1</italic> of maize is highly expressed in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, culms, and husks and pedicels of the ear during reproductive growth of maize; and the expression of <italic>ZmSUT1</italic> in the leaf blades was shown to increase as the level of photoassimilates increases, reflecting its role in phloem loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consistent with this observation, impaired phloem loading in the <italic>zmsut1</italic> mutant causes accumulation of carbohydrates in the leaf that led to chlorosis, senescence and reduced plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The three <italic>TaSUT1</italic> homeologues, which reside on chromosome 4 of the wheat A, B and D genomes, are found to be expressed at similar levels in flag leaf blades, leaf sheaths and internodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], suggesting their equal roles in phloem loading of sucrose. The transcript abundance of <italic>TaSUT1</italic> in these tissues was highest before heading and decreased immediately after flowering, when an increased level of its transcript was evident in the developing seeds. A study with symplastic fluorescein tracer has shown the lack of plasmodesmatal connections in the SE-CC complex of wheat flag leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], supporting the hypothesis that <italic>TaSUT1</italic> is involved in phloem loading of sucrose. In addition, all <italic>SUT</italic>s of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the two known <italic>SUT</italic> of barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] are shown to be expressed in source leaves. Previous studies have also shown that non-foliar tissues of wheat florets, including the glume, lemma and palea, possess photosynthetic ability and contribute 10% to 44% of photoassimilates destined to wheat seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In agreement with this, transcripts of <italic>TaSUT1</italic> were detected in the glumes of wheat ear both before and after heading, although at lower levels than that observed in the flag leaf blades and sheaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], suggesting its role in phloem loading of the sucrose produced in the spike.</p>
      <p>Leaf sheaths of cereal crops connect leaf blades to the stem nodes, thereby forming phloem conduits that serve as pathways for long distance transport of photoassimilates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Along with internodes, they also act as a temporary storage of excess carbohydrates produced during the early stages of seed filling in the form of water-soluble carbohydrates, mainly fructans. Approximately 50% of the photoassimilates destined to seed filling in wheat appears to be temporarily stored in the leaf sheaths and internodes prior to remobilization during active seed filling, when photoassimilate supply from the leaf is not enough to meet the sink demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A role for reloading sucrose into the phloem during the remobilization process has been suggested for <italic>OsSUT1</italic> and <italic>TaSUT1</italic> as their transcripts are present in the leaf sheath and stem tissues of rice and wheat, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Given that carboxyfluorescein dye moves symplastically out of the phloem in wheat internode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the presence of <italic>TaSUT1</italic> transcripts in this tissue also suggests its role in retrieving sucrose leaked out into the phloem apoplasm, and thereby providing an efficient photoassimilate translocation mechanism.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>SUT1</italic> is highly expressed in the developing seeds of different cereal crops including rice, barley and wheat. In rice, <italic>SUT1</italic> is expressed at similar levels from early to late stage of seed filling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Consistently, antisense expression of <italic>OsSUT1</italic> resulted in impaired seed filling and retarded germination with no effect on photosynthesis in the flag leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The <italic>SUT1</italic> of barley, however, exhibited its highest expression during the mid-stage of seed development. The transcripts of <italic>OsSUT1</italic> and <italic>HvSUT1</italic> are localized mainly in the maternal nucellar projections, aleurone tissues, and filial transfer cells that separate the endosperm cavity from the endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, anti-OsSUT1 antibody was shown to bind to the plasma membranes of nucellar projections and aleurone tissues of developing wheat seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As the maternal and filial tissues of cereal seeds lack symplastic connections; these results suggest the role of SUT1 in the post-phloem transport of sucrose from the maternal to the filial tissues of developing seeds.</p>
      <p>Plant SUTs have been classified into five subfamilies, SUT1 to SUT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based on their significant similarity at the amino acid level, <italic>OsSUT2</italic> and <italic>HvSUT2</italic> are assigned to the SUT4 subfamily rather than to the monocot specific SUT3 or SUT5 subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and these genes are found to be expressed in both source and sink tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The expression of <italic>HvSUT2</italic> in developing seeds was relatively predominant during the earlier and later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], whereas that of <italic>OsSUT2</italic> was restricted only to the earlier stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In developing barley seeds, <italic>HvSUT2</italic> has been shown to have almost similar cellular localization as that of <italic>HvSUT1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent proteomic and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein studies showed that some members of the SUT4 subfamily including HvSUT2 and OsSUT2, and those derived from other species such as Arabidopsis (AtSUT4), Lotus (LjSUT4) and poplar (PtaSUT4) are localized to the vacuolar tonoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting that these proteins are involved in vacuolar storage of sucrose and its transport across the tonoplast to the cytosol. Consistently, a knockout mutation of <italic>OsSUT2</italic> and RNAi mediated suppression of <italic>PtaSUT4</italic> caused accumulation of sucrose in source leaves of rice and poplar, respectively, due to a decrease in sucrose transport from the vacuolar to the cytoplasmic compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>Plant SUTs play important roles in the allocation of photoassimilates in the form of sucrose from the source to sink tissues, and thereby determine seed yield. Identifying and characterizing new SUTs, thus, provide insights into the regulation of sucrose transport. Although wheat is one of the most economically important crops of the world, only one wheat <italic>SUT</italic> gene has been identified and characterized to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The present study identified a new <italic>SUT</italic>, designated as <italic>TaSUT2</italic>, and its homeologous from hexaploid wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv. AC Andrew), and determined their subcellular localization and functionality as SUTs using a yeast heterologous system. Furthermore, the total expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> and the relative contribution of each of the three genomes were investigated in both source and sink tissues at different stages of development.</p>

        <p>Wheat plants (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv.

Mature dry seeds were imbibed on a moist sterile Whatman #1 filter paper in a Petri plate (15 seeds per plate) in darkness for three days. Germinated seedlings were planted in 1-gallon pot (1 seedling per pot) containing Sunshine Mix #4 (LA4; Sungro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA, USA) and ~19&#xA0;g mineral supplement (Cornell mixture; 100&#xA0;g calcium carbonate, 150&#xA0;g osmocote [18-6-12], 120&#xA0;g superphosphate [0-45-0], 2&#xA0;g fritted trace elements, 1.5&#xA0;g chelated iron [13.2%], 0.7&#xA0;g chelated zinc [14%]) at a depth of ~2&#xA0;cm. The pots were then placed in a growth chamber at 18&#xB0;C/14&#xB0;C (day/night) under a 16/8&#xA0;h photoperiod with cool white fluorescent (F96T12/CW/VHO; Sylvania, Danvers, MA, USA) light (175&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol&#xA0;m<sup>-2</sup>&#xA0;s<sup>-1</sup>) until harvest.</p>
        <p>Young leaves harvested from 15- to 35-day-old plants of cv. AC Andrew and the three diploid progenitors were used for cloning the cDNAs of <italic>TaSUT2</italic>s. For all other studies, tissues were harvested at heading (eight days before anthesis) and at different days after anthesis (DAA). Vegetative tissues harvested at heading included flag leaf blade, flag leaf sheath and peduncle. To collect tissues at different DAAs, plants were tagged upon the first extrusion of the yellow anthers and this stage was considered as 0 DAA. The vegetative tissues described above along with developing spikes were harvested from individual primary or secondary tillers (one tiller per plant per replication; 3 replications) at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 DAA. To minimize variations between samples, the seed and non-seed components including glumes, lemmas and paleas were harvested from the middle region of each spike (6&#x2013;10 spikelets; 2&#x2013;3 florets per spikelet). Tissues were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> immediately after harvesting and then stored at -80&#xB0;C until further use.</p>

        <title>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from vegetative tissues (~100&#xA0;mg fresh weight per sample) using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Extraction of total RNA from developing seeds was performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The RNA samples were then subjected to cDNA synthesis using the RevertAid&#x2122; H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol.</p>

        <title>Molecular cloning of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> cDNA</title>
        <p>The cDNA samples derived from the young leaves of hexaploid wheat cv. AC Andrew were amplified using specific primers designed from the conserved coding regions of the previously identified <italic>SUT2</italic> genes of barley [GenBank:AJ272308] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], maize [GenBank:AY639018] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and rice [GenBank:AY137242] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced. Gene specific primers were designed from the newly isolated partial fragment to identify the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; end fragments with RACE-PCR using SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Amplification products of the 5&#x2032; RACE and 3&#x2032; RACE were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and then sequenced. Following end-to-end PCR the resulting DNA fragment was sequenced and then BLAST searched against the GenBank database.</p>

Translation of their predicted ORFs using the JustBio translation tool showed that <italic>TaSUT2A</italic>, <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> cDNAs encode 506, 506 and 508 amino acids with estimated molecular masses of 53.87, 53.87 and 53.92&#xA0;kDa, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences of TaSUT2A, TaSUT2B and TaSUT2D exhibited over 99.3% identity one another and 92.6% identity with those of HvSUT2, OsSUT2 and ZmSUT2 proteins (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). BLAST search analysis against the GenBank database showed that the three homeologues of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> are new members of the GPH cation symporter family to which all other plant SUTs belong. Protein topology prediction using the TMpred program indicated that all the three proteins contain 12 transmembrane helices (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, the three SUT2s of wheat contain the consensus sequence derived from the highly conserved region of functional plant SUTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and the histidine residue that appears to be localized at or associated conformationally with sucrose binding sites of SUTs (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Generation of a phylogenetic tree using the MEGA software based on the amino acid sequences of TaSUT2A, TaSUT2B and TaSUT2D, and other representative SUTs from both monocot and dicot species showed that the three TaSUT2s are members of the SUT4 subfamily (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which mainly contains tonoplast localized SUTs.

        <title>Expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> in source tissues</title>
        <p>The total expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> was also investigated in the source tissues including flag leaf blade, flag leaf sheath and peduncle (at heading and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 DAA), and non-foliar tissues of florets including glume, lemma and palea (at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 DAA). The transcripts of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> were detected in all tissues examined (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A, B). The level of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> transcripts in the flag leaf blade was relatively higher at heading and during the early periods of seed development (5 to 10 DAA), after which it showed a 5-fold decrease and remained at a similar level through 30 DAA (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). Expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> in the flag leaf sheath and peduncle tissues was almost similar across all the stages of seed development examined in this study, except that its level in the peduncle was slightly lower at the time of heading. The non-foliar lemma and palea tissues of developing florets exhibited similar abundance of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> transcripts, although substantially higher abundance was evident in the lemma at the early stage (5 DAA; Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). The pattern of glume-derived <italic>TaSUT2</italic> transcript abundance was almost similar to that observed in the lemma and palea tissues, but at a relatively lower level.</p>

        <title>Amplification of fragments unique to each homeologue of <italic>TaSUT2</italic></title>
        <p>The high percentage of nucleotide identity (~99%) among the three homeologues of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> could not allow us to design coding region-derived primers that are able to separately amplify amplicons of each homeologue. BLAST searching the coding DNA sequences of <italic>TaSUT2A</italic>, <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> against the IWGSC Survey Sequence Repository revealed contigs derived from the A, B and D genomes of wheat that contain a portion of the coding sequence (with over 99% sequence identity) and the respective 3&#x2032; UTR region of each homeologue. Alignment of the 3&#x2032; UTR sequences derived from the three genomes revealed a polymorphic region that can produce a unique amplicon for each homeologue (134&#xA0;bp for <italic>TaSUT2A</italic>; 125&#xA0;bp for <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and 116&#xA0;bp for <italic>TaSUT2D</italic>; Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

        <title>Genomic contribution to the total expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic></title>
        <p>Transcript contribution of each genome to the total expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> was examined in both sink and source tissues during the rapid seed filling period, from 10 DAA to 25 DAA, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Our results showed that genomic contribution varies with tissues and stages (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In the seed, genome A contributes the most; however, its contribution varies with stage (39% to 51%). With respect to the vegetative source tissues, genome B is the major contributor (40%) in the flag leaf blade at 10 DAA followed by genome A (34%) and then by D (27%). As the flag leaf blade develops from 10 to 15 DAA, both B and D genomes contribute equally at a level slightly higher than that of genome A, which appears to be a major contributor during the later stages, 20 to 25 DAA (39% to 40%). Although genome A contributes the most in the flag leaf sheath from 10 to 20 DAA (40% to 49%), both A and D genomes contribute equally at a level higher than that of genome B at 25 DAA. In the peduncle, genome A contributes the most at 10 DAA and 25 DAA (44% to 52%), however, the three genomes appear to contribute almost equally at 15 DAA. With respect to the non-seed source tissues of the spike, the contribution of genome A is predominant in the glume at 10 DAA, but both A and D genomes contributes almost equally, each at a higher level than that of B, in the subsequent stages. In the lemma and palea tissues, genome D has the most contribution at 10 DAA (38%), while both A and D genomes contribute equally (at higher level than that of B) at 15 DAA. From 20 to 25 DAA, genome A is the major contributor in these tissues followed by D and then by B. When all tissues and developmental stages are taken into account, the average contribution of genome A (40%) is higher than that of genome D (32%) and genome B (28%).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Starch deposition in the seeds of cereal crops is determined at least partly by the translocation of sucrose from the source tissues. Sucrose transport across the cellular membrane barriers is mediated by SUTs, and genes encoding these proteins have been identified and functionally characterized from a number of cereal crops including rice, maize and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To date, however, only one <italic>SUT</italic> (<italic>TaSUT1</italic>) has been identified and characterized in hexaploid wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To gain better insights into the regulation of the partitioning of assimilates from source tissues to developing seeds in wheat, it is important to isolate and characterize more SUTs. To this end, in the present study, we identified the three homeologues of a new <italic>SUT</italic> gene, designated as <italic>TaSUT2</italic>, and investigated their functionality, subcellular localization, and spatiotemporal and genome specific expression patterns. The <italic>TaSUT2A</italic>, <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> genes have respective ORFs of 1518&#xA0;bp, 1518&#xA0;bp and 1524&#xA0;bp encoding proteins with 506, 506 and 508 amino acids, respectively (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), with estimated molecular masses of ~54&#xA0;kDa. Similar to that observed in the three cDNAs of <italic>TaSUT1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the <italic>TaSUT2A, TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> genes differ mainly in the 3&#x2019; UTR region (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several lines of evidence from sequence and phylogeny analyses suggest that the newly identified homeologues of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> encode putative SUTs. Firstly, their cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences show very high sequence homology with <italic>SUT2</italic>s (90%) and the corresponding proteins (93%), respectively, of rice, barley and maize (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Secondly, their proteins contain the 12 transmembrane helices (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), coined as distinct characteristic features of all members of the GPH cation symporter family to which all the known plant SUTs belong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and the consensus sequence derived from the highly conserved region of functional SUTs (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thirdly, the histidine residue that is conserved across all known plant SUTs and appears to be localized at or associated conformationally with sucrose binding site of SUTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] is present in the first extracellular loop of TaSUT2s (His-61 in TaSUT2A and TaSUT2B, and His-63 in TaSUT2D; Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The significant similarity exhibited by partial cDNA sequences of <italic>TaSUT2A</italic>, <italic>TaSUT2B</italic> and <italic>TaSUT2D</italic> with contigs derived from chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1) suggests that these genes are located on chromosome 5; establishing a differential chromosomal location between <italic>TaSUT1</italic>, which resides on chromosome 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and <italic>TaSUT2</italic>.</p>
      <p>Phylogenetically, the TaSUT2A, TaSUT2B and TaSUT2D proteins are grouped into the SUT4 subfamily that includes low affinity and tonoplast localized dicot SUT4s and monocot SUT2s rather than into the monocot specific SUT3, which includes the TaSUT1, and SUT5 subfamilies (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, TaSUT2s contain the putative vacuolar targeting dileucine motif (LXXLL) found in the cytoplasmic N-terminus of all members of the SUT4 subfamily, except for AtSUT4 which instead has KRVLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Consistently, our subcellular localization analysis of TaSUT2 using YFP fusion protein showed that it is a tonoplast localized SUT (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The low (&lt; 45%) similarity of TaSUT2A, TaSUT2B and TaSUT2D with the corresponding homeologues of TaSUT1 explains the phylogenetic distant relationship between TaSUT1 and TaSUT2 proteins. Likewise, HvSUT1 and HVSUT2 that share only 42% similarity between one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] are grouped into two different SUT subfamilies, SUT3 and SUT4, respectively (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To date, the SUSY7/<italic>ura3</italic> mutant strain of yeast has been used as a tool of choice to study the biological functionalities of plant SUTs. This mutant strain of yeast cannot utilize external sucrose as its cytosolic and extracellular invertases are knocked out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, the expression of a plant sucrose synthase in its cytosol enables the mutant strain to grow on sucrose provided that SUT is expressed in its plasma membrane. Complementation of the SUSY7/<italic>ura3</italic> yeast cells with TaSUT2A, TaSUT2B and TaSUT2D enabled the yeast cells to uptake sucrose and grow on media containing sucrose as a sole carbon source (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This result is inconsistent with TaSUT2&#x2019;s localization to the tonoplast, as a plasma membrane-localized SUT is required to uptake sucrose from the medium. It is therefore likely that TaSUT2 is mislocalized to the plasma membrane in the heterologous system, and this mislocalization artifact led to complementation of the yeast SUSY7/<italic>ura3</italic> mutant. Similar results of complementation of the SUSY7/<italic>ura3</italic> yeast cells with tonoplast-localized HvSUT2 of barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], PtaSUT4 of populus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and expression-optimized OsSUT2 of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] have been reported. However, heterologous expression of a plant SUT in yeast does not necessarily reveal their subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>In order to gain insights into the physiological roles of <italic>TaSUT2</italic>, we analyzed its total expression in the source (flag leaf blade and sheath, peduncle, glume, lemma and plaea) and sink (developing seeds) tissues before and after seed formation (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> in seeds was relatively higher during the early (5&#x2013;10 DAA) and late (25 DAA) stages of their development (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), whereas <italic>TaSUT1</italic> was shown to be highly expressed during the mid/rapid phase of seed filling (16&#x2013;20 DAH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is therefore likely that TaSUT1 and TaSUT2 play functionally and temporally distinct roles during seed development. Consistent with these results, the expression of <italic>HvSUT2</italic> was relatively higher during the earlier and later stages of seed development, where as that of <italic>HvSUT1</italic> was predominant by the mid-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Localization of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> transcripts in the vein of developing seeds (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A, C) suggests that TaSUT2s are involved in the partitioning of sucrose between the vacuolar and cytoplasmic cell compartments in the vein.</p>
      <p>Seed filling in wheat is supported mainly by photoassimilates derived from the flag leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, the relatively higher abundance of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> transcripts in the source flag leaf blade before anthesis and during the early stages (5&#x2013;10 DAA) of seed development (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A) may suggest the role for TaSUT2 in intracellular partitioning of sucrose in the leaves, and thereby regulating the allocation of assimilates from leaf to seed tissues. The other known wheat <italic>SUT</italic> gene, <italic>TaSUT1</italic>, which is localized to the plasma membrane and involved in phloem loading, also exhibit expression in the flag leaf blade before and after heading, although its level after heading was lower than before heading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This implies the complementarity of these two genes in regulating sucrose transport from source to sink tissues; the <italic>TaSUT2</italic> controlling the cytosolic sucrose homeostasis while the <italic>TaSUT1</italic> regulating sucrose loading to the phloem. Consistently, the tonoplast localized <italic>SUT2</italic>s of barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] are found to be expressed in the source leaf tissues. Furthermore, <italic>OsSUT2</italic> mutants of rice and poplar plants expressing RNAi-suppressed <italic>PtaSUT4</italic> showed increased accumulation of sucrose in their leaves, which in turn resulted in reduced plant height, tiller number, and seed weight in rice, and increased leaf to stem biomass ratio in popular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The decline in the transcript abundance of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> in the flag leaf blade during the later stages of seed filling can be associated with the senescence of leaves and decreased accumulation of storage sucrose in the vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The localization of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> transcripts in the mesophyll cells of leaf blade (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>E, G) might imply their significance in regulating intracellular sucrose partitioning within these cells of a leaf tissue.</p>
      <p>Parts of the peduncle and leaf sheath tissues of wheat are exposed to incoming radiation, and thus can photosynthesize and produce photoassimilates that contribute approximately 9% to 12% of wheat seed dry matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It has also been shown that photosynthesis in the glume, lemma and palea tissues of a wheat floret contributes 10% to 44% of the photoassimilates destined to wheat seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, the expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> in the peduncle and leaf sheath (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A), and the glume, lemma and palea of the spike (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B) likely suggests its involvement in the intracellular transport of sucrose from the vacuole to the cytoplasm in these tissues. In agreement with this, source tissues of cereals primarily store sucrose rather than transitory starch temporarily in their vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It appeared from our genome specific semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis that the contribution of the three wheat genomes to the total expression of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> varies with tissues and developmental stages (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), suggesting a specific spatio-temporal role for each <italic>TaSUT2</italic> homeologue in determining the activity of TaSUT2.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study demonstrated that <italic>TaSUT2</italic> encodes a new wheat SUT localized to the tonoplast, and phylogentically it belongs to the SUT4 subfamily that mainly contains vacuolar membrane SUTs. These results along with its spatiotemporal expression patterns at the gene level suggest that TaSUT2 is involved in the exchange of sucrose between the vacuolar and cytoplasmic cell compartments in both sink and source tissues. However, elucidating the definitive physiological role of <italic>TaSUT2</italic> requires mutational analysis for changes in sucrose transport activity, levels of metabolites in the sucrose-starch pathway, and overall seed yield and other yield parameters.</p>
