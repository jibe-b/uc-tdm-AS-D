        <p>Resistance of <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> to carbendazim is caused by point mutations in the <italic>&#x3B2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-tubulin gene. The point mutation at codon 167 (TTT &#x2192; TAT, F167Y) occurs in more than 90% of field resistant isolates in China. To establish a suitable method for rapid detection of the F167Y mutation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, an efficient and simple method with high specificity was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). A set of four primers was designed and optimized to specially distinguish the F167Y mutation genotype. The LAMP reaction was optimal at 63&#xB0;C for 60&#x2005;min. When hydroxynaphthol blue dye (HNB) was added prior to amplification, samples with DNA of the F167Y mutation developed a characteristic sky blue color after the reaction but those without DNA or with different DNA did not. Results of HNB staining method were reconfirmed by gel electrophoresis. The developed LAMP had good specificity, stability and repeatability and was suitable for monitoring carbendazim-resistance populations of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in agricultural production.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab, caused mainly by <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (teleomorph = <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic>), is one of the most common fungal diseases of cereal crops worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Under favorable conditions, this fungus can cause severe yield losses and produce mycotoxins that are harmful to humans and animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Owing to low levels of host resistance, application of fungicides is the principal method for controlling FHB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Carbendazim and other benzimidazole fungicides with the action mode of mitosis inhibition, have been shown to be effective against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including most ascomycetes and some deuteromycetes, and also used to control FHB over the past three decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Carbendazim and its mixtures are still the main reagents for controlling FHB in China. However, carbendazim-resistant <italic>Fusarium</italic> populations have increased under high selective pressure of fungicide in recent years, and FHB in China has become more severe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>Previous studies on the resistance of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to carbendazim is mainly caused by point mutations in the <italic>&#x3B2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-tubulin gene (FGSG 06611.3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, including codons 50 (TAC &#x2192; TGC, Y50C), 167 (TTT &#x2192; TAT, F167Y), 198 (GAG &#x2192; CTG, E198L; GAG &#x2192; CAG, E198K; GAG &#x2192; AAG, E198Q) and 200 (TTC &#x2192; TAC, F200Y). Among the carbendazim-resistant isolates from the field, the mutation genotype at codon F167Y was dominant, accounting for more than 90% of the resistant isolates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
    <p>In order to predict the development of fungicide resistance and to use fungicide and other disease control tactics effectively, researchers must develop methods for resistance early detection. Previous detection methods have been established by mycelial growth inhibition and spore germination assay on PDA containing the different concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, but the procedure is time-consuming and tedious, and the detection efficiency is low. Several common techniques were developed in recent years based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as DNA sequencing, allele-specific PCR (ASPCR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, single-strand conformation polymorphism PCR (SSCP-PCR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA-PCR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, TaqMan-MGB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, the LightCycler-based PCR hybridisation mutation assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and primer-introduced restriction analysis PCR (PIRA-PCR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. DNA sequencing is the standard method for identifying mutations, but it requires much more time and is expensive when a large number of samples must be analyzed. Although ASPCR is an excellent method, its use frequently requires extensive optimisation, and background amplification is often high. PCR-RFLP is based on the alteration of a restriction enzyme site caused by a point mutation, so it is useless when the point mutation does not result in the alteration of a restriction enzyme site. Based on the point mutation at codon F167Y (TTT &#x2192; TAT, F167Y) of the <italic>&#x3B2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-tubulin gene in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, PIRA-PCR and cycleave PCR methods were developed for rapid detection of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> genotypes (F167Y) resistant to carbendazim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The methods could detect carbendazim resistance much more rapidly than the classical mycelial growth inhibition and spore germination assays. However, they have several intrinsic disadvantages, including the requirement of rapid thermal cycling, insufficient specificity, and rather low amplification efficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Herein, we developed a new nucleic acid amplification method that can be used to detect the resistant mutants of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to the carbendazim-group fungicides in the absence of a thermal cycler in this study.</p>
    <p>Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a novel technique, has been developed, which can amplify nucleic acids with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions, and employ self-recurring strand-displacement synthesis primed by a specially designed set of target-specific primers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. A set of four specially designed primers, which recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target, was used for the LAMP assay. An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target DNA initiates LAMP. The following strand-displacement DNA synthesis primed by an outer primer releases a single-stranded DNA. This serves as a template for DNA synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that hybridize to the other end of the target, which produces a stem-loop DNA structure. In the subsequent LAMP cycling, one inner primer hybridizes to the loop on the product and initiates displacement DNA synthesis, yielding the original stem-loop DNA and a new stem-loop DNA with a stem twice as long. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 10<sup>9</sup> copies of target in less than an hour. The final products are stem-loop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. LAMP products can be visualized with naked eyes by adding DNA-intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide, SYBR Green I, propidium iodide, or Quant-iTPicoGreen; by adding metal-ion indicators such as hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, CuSO<sub>4</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, or calcein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> or by measuring the increase in turbidity derived from magnesium pyrophosphate formation (to infer increases in amplified DNA concentration). LAMP products can also be detected by real-time detection methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The simplicity of the LAMP method, which does not require a thermal cycler, makes it suitable for detecting field resistant populations.</p>
    <p>During the last 10 years, with the development of LAMP, it has been widely applied in qualitative detection of many plant pathogenic microorganisms, such as <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <italic>Meloidogyne enterolobii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and phytoplasmas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, the application of LAMP on the field of fungicide resistance has not been reported. We developed a LAMP assay for the detection of carbendazim-resistant isolates of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> based on the point mutation at codon 167 of the <italic>&#x3B2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-tubulin gene and demonstrated that the assay was applicative and efficient in fields. The new LAMP assay will be valuable to cereal growers because it will help guide the management of carbendazim resistance in FHB timely.</p>

        <title>Optimization of LAMP primers</title>
        <p>Based on the point mutation (TTT &#x2192; TAT, F167Y) of the <italic>&#x3B2;<sub>2</sub></italic>-tubulin gene of carbendazim -resistant mutant R9, a set of LAMP primers was designed using the Primer explorer V4 software program. LAMP is very sensitive, and it is occasionally possible for products to be amplified from the wild types; thus, one or two mismatches were added to a primer in each primer set. The mismatches were added to increase the likelihood that the primers would specifically amplify the F167Y substitution. Seven sets of LAMP primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>) were tested to identify appropriate primers using the genomic DNA of the wild type isolate 2021 and the F167Y mutant R9. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, only a set of LAMP primers (S7) was appropriate for detecting the mutation. The positive LAMP reaction was indicated by a sky blue color; while the negative reaction remained violet color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). After the tubes were visually assessed by color change, they were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. As expected, the typical ladder-like pattern on 3.0% gel electrophoresis was observed in a positive sample, but not in the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The results showed that the primer set S7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>) could be used to distinguish the F167Y mutation of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

The reactions were performed in 0.2-mL centrifuge tubes in a water bath for temperature control. As expected, the typical ladder-like pattern on 3% gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>) and visual detection with HNB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>) were observed in the mutant R9 but not in the wild type isolate 2021 and ddH<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

Additionally, the resistant mutation genotypes were confirmed by sequencing, which was consistent with the MIC method. All the resistant mutants (F167Y) were positive based on HNB-visualization or gel electrophoresis, whereas other mutants and wild type strains were negative.

        <title>Application of LAMP on monitoring carbendazim-resistance populations of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in agricultural production</title>
        <p>The aim of these experiments was to demonstrate the application of LAMP on resistance monitoring of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to carbendazim in agricultural production. In 2013, 340 isolates from infected wheat spikelets were tested by MIC and the ratio of resistant mutants was 41.47%. To further verify the application of LAMP on resistance monitoring, LAMP was also performed using DNA of these isolates as templates, the positive-sample ratio was 38.82% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The resistance ratio of the F167Y mutation genotype in all the resistant mutants was 93.62%.</p>
        <p>In 2014, 1894 infected wheat spikelets were tested by LAMP and MIC. The positive-sample ratios were 497/1894 (26.24%) by LAMP and 519/1894 (27.4%) by MIC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). The positive-sample ratio by LAMP was up to 95.76% in all the resistant mutants. This result suggested that LAMP was very feasible to detect the resistant mutants in field.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>LAMP is a novel nucleic acid amplication technique, which amplifies with high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity under isothermal conditions. During the last 10 years, due to rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection, LAMP has been successfully applied in pathogenic microorganisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, it has not been used to detect mutations causing target-site-mediated fungicide resistance in plant pathogens. In this study, a highly practical and valid method for the detection of the F167Y mutation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of the LAMP assay for monitoring fungicide resistance in plant pathogens.</p>
      <p>To distinguish the F167Y mutation from the wild type, the mismatched primers were designed using the Primer Explorer V4 software program based on the point mutation (TTT &#x2192; TAT, F167Y) of the <italic>&#x3B2;<sub>2</sub></italic>-tubulin gene of MBC-resistant mutant R9. However, it will be a challenge to identify the best set of primers among several possibilities. In this study, seven primer sets were tested, and only S7 was appropriate for detecting the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Nagamine et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> accelerated the LAMP reaction by loop primers, which suggested that the LAMP reaction times would be shorter than the original method when using loop primers. With the primer set S7, suitable loop primers were identified and used to accelerate the reaction. However, the established LAMP assay could not distinguish the F167Y mutation from the wild type when using the loop primers. Based on the manual for LAMP primer designing, the loop primers are not essential for LAMP, so the LAMP reaction was performed without loop primers.</p>
      <p>Based on the selected best primer set (S7), the concentrations of reaction components and reaction conditions of LAMP were optimized and the LAMP assay was developed in this study. As the LAMP reaction progresses, pyrophosphate ions are produced, which bind to Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and form a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate. Therefore, the results of the LAMP can be visualized with the naked eyes by adding metal-ion indicators such as hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, CuSO<sub>4</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, or calcein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Moreover, LAMP products can also be judged with the naked eyes by adding DNA intercalating dyes, or by measuring the increase in turbidity derived from magnesium pyrophosphate. DNA intercalating dyes such as SYBR green<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> or Picogreen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> can be added after a reaction is completed. Due to the final addition of these intercalating dyes and exposed operation, most of the available methods suffer from increasing the rate of contamination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. To avoid this, HNB is added before incubation so that amplification is completed in a closed tube system, and the detection of color change requires no equipment. A positive reaction is indicated by a color change from violet to sky blue, and a negative reaction retains violet. In the current study, the positive and negative reactions could be successfully distinguished with HNB, and confirmed when the LAMP products were subjected to gel electrophoresis analysis.</p>
      <p>Compared with conventional detection methods, LAMP assay is easier to perform and more rapid, and the results are easier to evaluate. LAMP operates under isothermal conditions and the optimal temperature was set as 63&#xB0;C. LAMP is also rapid and 60&#x2005;min was optimal for detection of the F167Y mutation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Because LAMP is conducted isothermally, the thermal cycling required in PCR is unnecessary. Moreover, LAMP requires only a regular laboratory bath or heat block that can provide a constant temperature of 63&#xB0;C. It is simple and should be useful even for those laboratories and research institutes unfamiliar with PCR or other methods of molecular analysis.</p>
      <p>To confirm the efficiency and specificity of LAMP, DNA extracted from the mutant R9 (F167Y) and other mutants or wild-type isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S2</xref>) were used as templates for LAMP assay. The LAMP assay could distinguish the F167Y mutation specifically in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Restriction enzyme and sequence analyses also validated its specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
      <p>To determine the robustness and repeatability of LAMP, 28 known F167Y mutants from the geographical regions were tested. All the samples were positive with LAMP, and amplicons were confirmed through 3% gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of LAMP and PCR was tested using 10-fold serial dilutions of genomic DNA. The developed LAMP method had ten-fold higher sensitivity than that of the conventional PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S1</xref>). These results indicated that the LAMP assay established in this study had good repeatability and sensitivity.</p>
      <p>In the fields, the ascospores from the fruiting bodies perithecia on rice stubbles are the primary infection source of FHB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. To determine the applicability of LAMP in field samples, 116 rice stubbles with perithecia were tested by LAMP and MIC. The <italic>&#x3B2;<sub>2</sub></italic>-tubulin gene of the resistant mutants by the MIC was amplified and sequenced. Sequencing result showed that all the positive samples by LAMP had a point mutation at codon 167 of the <italic>&#x3B2;<sub>2</sub></italic>-tubulin gene. The ratio of the F167Y mutation in all the resistant mutants was 48/51 (94.12%), which was also confirmed by sequencing. Therefore, the LAMP assay could successfully detect the F167Y mutation in the perithecia produced on rice stubbles. This will be used for early warning of resistance risk in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to MBC in the field. Moreover, this will also provide important reference information for control tactics of FHB. In this study, we also demonstrated the application of LAMP on monitoring MBC-resistance populations of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in agricultural production. In 2013, the resistance frequency by MIC and LAMP was 41.47% and 38.82%, respectively. In 2014, the resistance frequency by MIC and LAMP was 27.4% and 26.24%, respectively. Compared with other methods, the newly developed LAMP significantly improved the detection efficiency. High resistance frequency will lead to control failures. Based on the data of carbendazim-resistance monitoring during 2013&#x2013;2014, the use of carbendazim in controlling FHB should be reduced. Therefore, the LAMP method developed in this study was very feasible to detect the resistant mutants in the field.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, A LAMP assay combined with HNB was established and demonstrated to be more sensitive, specific, and practical for detection of the F167Y mutation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> than previous methods. Therefore, it will be potentially useful for monitoring and management of carbendazim resistance in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in the future.</p>
