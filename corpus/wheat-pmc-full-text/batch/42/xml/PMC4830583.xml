        <p>Expansins are cell wall proteins that are grouped into two main families, &#x3B1;-expansins and &#x3B2;-expansins, and they are implicated in the control of cell extension via the disruption of hydrogen bonds between cellulose and matrix glucans. <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> is an &#x3B1;-expansin gene identified in wheat. Based on putative cis-regulatory elements in the <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> promoter sequence and the expression pattern induced when polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used to mimic water stress, we hypothesized that <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> is involved in plant drought tolerance and plant development. Through transient expression of <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>TaEXPA2-GFP</italic> in onion epidermal cells, TaEXPA2 was localized to the cell wall. Constitutive expression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> in tobacco improved seed production by increasing capsule number, not seed size, without having any effect on plant growth patterns. The transgenic tobacco exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to water-deficiency stress than did wild-type (WT) plants. We found that under drought stress, the transgenic plants maintained a better water status. The accumulated content of osmotic adjustment substances, such as proline, in <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> transgenic plants was greater than that in WT plants. Transgenic plants also displayed greater antioxidative competence as indicated by their lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative electrical conductivity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation than did WT plants. This result suggests that the transgenic plants suffer less damage from ROS under drought conditions. The activities of some antioxidant enzymes as well as expression levels of several genes encoding key antioxidant enzymes were higher in the transgenic plants than in the WT plants under drought stress. Collectively, our results suggest that ectopic expression of the wheat expansin gene <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> improves seed production and drought tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The expansins are a multigene family that includes the &#x3B1;-expansin (EXPA), &#x3B2;-expansin (EXPB), expansin-like A, and expansin-like B subfamilies. The amino acid sequences of the expansin proteins in these four subfamilies exhibit only 20&#x2013;40% identity. EXPA and EXPB, the two major groups, share several conserved motifs and likely have similar, but different, functions [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Analysis of the gene structures and predicted amino acid sequences of rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> expansins indicates that the &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-expansin genes evolved from one ancestral gene. The exon/intron organization is unchanged, but the length of each intron and the number of introns differs among the individual genes [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is believed that the functions of the &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-expansin genes are similar and different in a number of ways. For instance, two constitutively expressed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> expansin genes, <italic>AtEXP3</italic> and <italic>AtEXP-&#x3B2;1</italic>, representing the &#x3B1;-expansin and &#x3B2;-expansin subfamilies, respectively, changed transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf development: in the former, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf area was larger than wild-type (WT) leaf area, whereas in the latter, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants showed longer petiole lengths compared to WT plants. Salt sensitivity, by contrast, increased in both transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines, but the mechanisms of this increase were different, as seen by the differing transcription levels of two stress-associated genes, <italic>COR15a</italic> and <italic>KIN1</italic>, hours after salt treatment [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Adverse environmental conditions, such as drought and salt stress, affect plant growth and development. As one of the principal natural limitations on plant productivity, low water potential caused by insufficient soil water causes large economic losses in many regions [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Water deficits restrain plant growth by delaying both cell extension and cell division. During cell division and elongation, the cell wall must be extended and it must form a cellulose-hemicellulose network that is linked via hemicellulosic tethers [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Expansins have been implicated in the control of plant growth via the loosening of the extracellular matrix in a pH-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is increasing evidence for the involvement of expansins in the responses of various plant species to water stress. For example, increased expansin activity was found to be involved in maintaining the growth of maize primary roots at a low water potential [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The resurrection plant <italic>Craterostigma plantagineum</italic> has been used as a model for investigating desiccation tolerance at the molecular level, and cell wall extensibility in C. <italic>plantagineum</italic> leaves is known to increase during drying. At the same time, expansin activity and the expression levels of expansin genes in C. <italic>plantagineum</italic> increased during the process of dehydration and rehydration [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The expression of a rose expansin gene, <italic>RhEXPA4</italic>, is remarkably up-regulated in rose petals after dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and it confers salt and drought tolerance to transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. <italic>GmEXPB2</italic> is a root &#x3B2;-expansin gene that participates in root system architecture responses to several abiotic stresses, such as Fe, P, and water deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Wheat is cultivated as one of the most significant food crops worldwide, and drought stress is an acute environmental condition that can severely block the growth and productivity of wheat [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has been estimated that there are at least 30 &#x3B1;-expansin and 65 &#x3B2;-expansin genes in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our previous study indicated that wheat expansin expression responds to water stress [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ectopic expression of <italic>TaEXPB23</italic>, a wheat &#x3B2;-expansin gene, improved the drought tolerance and changed the phenotype of transgenic tobacco [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, to discover the similarities and differences in the functions of &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-expansins, we selected a wheat &#x3B1;-expansin gene, <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> (GenBank ID: AAT94292.1), and investigated its involvement in plant drought tolerance and development.</p>

        <title>Plant materials, growth conditions, and water stress treatments</title>
        <p>Wheat seeds (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) were germinated at 25&#xB0;C in the dark on absorbent cotton gauze drenched in sterile water on an enameled dish. The seedlings were then spread out uniformly in buckets to create hydroponic cultures in an illuminated incubation chamber (GXZ-500C, Jiangnan, China) under a relative humidity of 75%, a photosynthetically active radiation level about 300 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 25&#xB0;C. The 1/2 Hoagland&#x2019;s nutrient solution was renewed every 2 days. After 7 days, when two real leaves were fully expanded, 20% PEG, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM ABA, 50 mM GA, 10 mM MeJA, or 10 mM SA was added to the nutrient solution to initiate the experimental treatments. Seven-day-old wheat seedlings grown in 1/2 Hoagland&#x2019;s nutrient solution without any supplementation were used as a control group.</p>
        <p>The tobacco seedlings used (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> &#x2018;NC89&#x2019;) were grown from seeds that were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, 4% NaClO for 8 min, and then washed four times with sterile deionized water. The seeds were germinated in Murashige-Skoog (MS) media in a controlled environment at 25&#xB0;C under a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark).</p>
        <p>To measure the germination rates of transgenic tobacco lines under water stress, 50 seeds from transgenic and WT lines were surface-sterilized and sown in triplicate on MS plates supplemented with mannitol at concentrations of 0 mM, 100 mM, and 200 mM. The plates were placed under a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark) at 25&#xB0;C, and the germination rates were calculated after 10 days.</p>
        <p>To induce water stress in seedlings grown on MS media, 7-day-old tobacco seedlings were transplanted to new MS media with a different concentration of mannitol (0 mM, 100 mM, or 200 mM). The primary root length and lateral root length were tracked and analyzed statistically 20 days after treatment.</p>
        <p>For the dehydration treatment, 7-day-old tobacco seedlings grown on vermiculite were placed in an illuminated incubation chamber (GXZ-500C, Jiangnan, China) with photosynthetically active radiation of about 300 &#x3BC;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, a relative humidity of 75%, and a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 25&#xB0;C. They were left without irrigation for 7 days and were then re-watered for 2 days. Ten seedlings were planted in each pot, and the survival rate was recorded after re-watering.</p>
        <p>To determine the drought stress tolerance of the grown tobacco plants, transgenic and WT plants grown on vermiculite for 50 days under normal growing conditions were transferred to a climate-controlled greenhouse and received no watering for another 21 days. The greenhouse was controlled at 25&#xB0;C with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle (400&#x2013;600 &#x3BC;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and a relative humidity of 70&#x2013;80%. A control group was watered normally. The fully expanded leaves were used to calculate the physiological indexes. Phenotypic indexes, such as plant height, leaves, capsules, and seeds, were observed and recorded at intervals during plant growth and development.</p>

        <title>Cloning and assay of cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic></title>
        <p>Based on the expansin gene sequence, we designed custom reverse gene primers (<italic>GSP1</italic>, <italic>GSP2</italic>, <italic>GSP3</italic>). The isolation of the <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> gene promoter was achieved using the thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) technique. From two successful TAIL-PCR runs, we obtained a 1073-bp region upstream of the translation initiation codon (GenBank ID: KP729264). The cis-regulatory elements in the promoter sequence of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> were analyzed using PlantCARE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html</ext-link>) and PLACE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Dna.affrc.go.Jp">http://www.Dna.affrc.go.Jp</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>The open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>, minus the termination codon, was acquired by PCR amplification utilizing the specific primers <italic>GFP1</italic> and <italic>GFP2</italic>. The purified PCR products were linked into a pMD18-T simple vector (TaKaRa, Japan) and digested by BamH 1 and Sal 1. The fragments were fused to the N-terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector PBI121 under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter (<italic>35S</italic>::<italic>TaEXPA2-GFP</italic>). The vector <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> was used as control. The recombinant pBI121 plasmids were introduced into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain LBA4404, which was then used to transform onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) epidermal cells. The onion epidermal tissues were cultivated on MS plates under dark conditions at 28&#xB0;C for 24 h after transformation. A confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to observe the transformed onion cells.</p>

        <title>Generation of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing tobacco lines and quantitative real-time PCR analysis</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from wheat leaves with Trizol reagent (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Total RNA (2 &#x3BC;g) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA). Full-length cDNA of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> (GenBank accession number: AAT94292.1) was obtained by PCR using specific primers (named: <italic>A2-F</italic>, <italic>A2-R</italic>), and then this fragment was joined to pBI121 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The recombinant plasmid <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>TaEXPA2</italic> was introduced into the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain LBA4404, and then through leaf disc transformation the plasmid was mediated into WT plants. Independent transgenic lines were selected by kanamycin resistance.</p>
        <p>To assay gene expression, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed with the RNA samples prepared at the indicated time points after treatments. The qRT-PCR reactions were performed in a Bio-RAD MyiQ<sup>&#x2122;</sup> Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) using TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen, China) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Each reaction system (20 &#x3BC;l) contained 10 &#x3BC;l of 2&#xD7; real-time PCR mix (containing SYBR Green I), 1 &#x3BC;l of PCR forward or reverse primer, and adequately attenuated cDNA. The PCR temperature cycling conditions were 95&#xB0;C for 30 s followed by 45 cycles of 95&#xB0;C for 15 s, 58&#xB0;C for 30 s, and 72&#xB0;C for 15 s. The &#x3B1;<italic>-tubulin</italic> gene was used as an internal reference for all of the qRT-PCR analyses. Each treatment was repeated at least three times independently. Using the delta-delta Ct method, the relative expression levels were calculated.</p>
        <p>To assay the response of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression in wheat under the different treatments described above, qRT-PCR analysis was performed using gene-specific primers (named: <italic>RTA2-F</italic>, <italic>RTA2-R</italic>) and <italic>NtACTIN</italic> as an internal reference.</p>
        <p>To assay the expression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> in the WT and five independent transgenic plants, qRT-PCR was performed with the RNA samples extracted from 4-week-old seedlings.</p>
        <p>To assay the expression of antioxidant related genes, qRT-PCR analysis was performed with RNA samples isolated from leaves harvested after treatment with or without drought stress. The primers used were the same as those in Wu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

        <title>The deduced cis-regulatory element in the <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> promoter</title>
        <p>We obtained a 1073-bp promoter fragment upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153494.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and analyzed its cis-regulatory elements using the PLACE [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and PlantCARE databases [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Several regulators were found, including cis-acting elements involved in light responses, phytohormone signaling, and abiotic stress responsiveness, as well as an enhancer-like element involved in anoxic specific inducibility meristem expression, cell cycle regulation, zein metabolism regulation, seed-specific regulation, circadian control, and so on (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153494.t001">Table 1</xref>). For instance, abscisic acid response elements (ABREs) were found for abscisic acid responses; the CGTCA-motif and TGACG-motif were found for MeJA responses; the GARE-motif was found for GA responses; and the MBS and GC-motifs were found for drought stress responses. These imply the possible involvement of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> in plant development and stress tolerance.</p>

        <p>We then tested the expression levels in 2-week-old wheat seedlings exposed to PEG, NaCl, ABA, GA, MeJA, and SA. Although the transcription level of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> was slightly reduced at first, it strongly increased after 12 h of PEG treatment compared to the control. Under the other treatments, the accumulation of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> mRNA was down-regulated to various degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g001">Fig 1B&#x2013;1D</xref>).

        <p>To investigate the subcellular localization of the TaEXPA2 protein in plant cells, we performed transient expression assays with plasmids expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone, and expressing the TaEXPA2-GFP fusion protein. Onion epidermal cells were used to transiently express the fusion protein through the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation method.

        <title>The generation and identification of the transgenic tobacco plants</title>
        <p>The full-length sequence of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> was cloned into the plant expression vector, named pBI121, using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Then the vectors with <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>TaEXPA2</italic> were inserted into tobacco leaves. The transformants were detected by qRT-PCR analysis. Five independent homozygous lines showed high levels of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression, whereas the WT plants exhibited no expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The expression of TaEXPA2 in the leaf cell wall of three of these transgenic lines (OE-6, OE-9, and OE-16), and its absence in the WT plants, was further confirmed by western blot analysis using an antibody raised against TaEXPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). No bands were observed in WT plants, whereas clear positive bands were found in lanes containing transgenic plant extract. We also measured the activity levels of expansin in the cell walls of WT and transgenic lines. The transgenic plants consistently had 1.5-fold to 1.8-fold higher levels of expansin activity than the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These results demonstrated that the <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> gene was successfully introduced into the tobacco plants and it substantially increased the activity of expansin.</p>

        <title>Seed production was increased in <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing tobacco plants</title>
        <p>To examine the phenotypic changes caused by the overexpression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> in transgenic tobacco plants, we continued our investigations over the whole development process. Compared with WT plants, transgenic plants did not show any obvious alteration in growth patterns, including leaf number, leaf area, internode length, plant height, and anthesis. However, the transgenic plants were found to have a larger inflorescence with more capsules compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Moreover, the number of capsules in the plants from each of the three transgenic tobacco lines corresponded, in order, to the relative <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression levels and expansin activity levels in those three transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). When we examined capsule length, we found that WT plants had values primarily in the 1.5&#x2013;1.7 cm range, whereas capsule length in the three transgenic tobacco lines was primarily in the 1.6&#x2013;1.9 cm range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Seed production per plant was also higher in the transgenic tobacco than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), and this was also supported by statistical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>

        <p>In particular, we detected the expression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> during wheat seed development. The expression level of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> changed in wheat seeds during the grain-filling period, and was especially high at 21 days after grain fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). However, the seed sizes of the transgenic tobacco plants were similar to the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

        <p>We then tested the growth response of the tobacco seedlings to drought stress. There was no significant difference in the mannitol-free medium.

      <p>Since the first expansin gene was discovered by McQueen-Mason et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], an increasing number of expansin gene sequences have been cloned by different techniques and functionally characterized. Expansins are small proteins consisting of three regions, including an N-terminal signal peptide (attached to the cell wall), domain 1 (containing conserved Cys residues and an HFD motif), and domain 2 (a putative cellulose-binding domain). EXPAs have all of the aforementioned structural features, whereas in other expansin subfamilies, some of the domains may be missing. Notably, most EXPBs are predicted to have N-linked glycosylation sites near the amino and carboxyl termini, sites that EXPAs do not have [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This suggests that EXPAs and EXPBs have analogous but different functions.</p>
      <p>Wheat is one of the most significant food crops worldwide. There are fewer functional studies of wheat expansins, however, because wheat is hexaploid, and this results in a large amount of genetic information [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our previous work, we cloned a wheat EXPB gene named <italic>TaEXPB23</italic>. We found that <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> was involved in responses to abiotic stresses and phytohormone signals. Constitutive or root-specific overexpression of <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic tobacco lines [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The wheat gene in the present study, <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>, is an EXPA expansin gene. Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] detected a group of expansin gene expression patterns by real-time PCR and suggested that <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> plays a role in wheat cell wall growth. In this paper, we studied the gene&#x2019;s functions in plant development and drought tolerance, and compared the similarities and differences between wheat &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-expansin genes.</p>

For example, the <italic>Festuca pratensis</italic> &#x3B1;-expansins, <italic>FpExp1</italic>, <italic>FpExp3</italic>, <italic>FpExp4</italic>, and <italic>FpExp5</italic>, were only expressed in the 3 cm apical region of growing adventitious root tips. High levels of <italic>FpExp2</italic> mRNA were detectable in all four analyzed tissues, including the leaf elongation zone, coleoptile, apex, and roots. Transcripts of <italic>FpExpB3</italic>, a <italic>Festuca pratensis</italic> &#x3B2;-expansin, were low in the leaf elongation zone, coleoptiles, and root tips, but substantial accumulation was detected in the apex [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We measured the gene expression patterns of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> in different wheat organs by qRT-PCR. <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> was expressed in all of the wheat organs examined, but the highest expression level was observed in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Expansins can be induced by the classical defense hormones [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Based on the putative cis-regulatory elements in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153494.t001">Table 1</xref>, some stress response and signaling elements were observed in the promoter of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>. We evaluated the responses of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression to PEG, NaCl, ABA, GA, MeJA, and SA treatments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g001">Fig 1B&#x2013;1D</xref>, <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression responded to all of the stress treatments and phytohormone signaling molecules. The most obvious increase in <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression was caused by PEG-induced water stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> may be involved in plant drought tolerance.</p>
        <p>Expansins are cell wall proteins that are implicated in the control of plant growth via loosening of the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Choi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggested that expansins are primarily distributed over the expanding cell wall and bind to the cell wall. However, there are at least three expansin proteins that, whereas possessing an N-terminal signal peptide for targeting to the cell wall, are known to be located in the plasma membrane: OsEXPA17, AtEXP7, HvEXPB7 [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our study, we fused TaEXPA2 to GFP, and the subcellular localization of GFP-tagged TaEXPA2 protein in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells indicated that <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> encodes a cell wall protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> increased seed yield of transgenic tobacco by increasing capsule number, not seed size</title>
        <p>By detecting the expression levels of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>, as well as TaEXPA2 protein accumulation in leaf cell walls and the activity levels of expansin, we confirmed that <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> was overexpressed in the transgenic tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Three transgenic lines, OE-6, OE-9, and OE-16, were selected to investigate the functions of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>.</p>
        <p>Expansin is involved in a variety of plant growth and development processes, such as vegetative and reproductive growth and fruit development [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. With respect to seed production, two <italic>GmEXPB2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic soybean lines showed improved yield potential under low P conditions [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Overexpression of the sweet potato expansin gene <italic>IbEXP1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> increased the number of rosette leaves and siliques, as well as the seed sizes, a process that may be regulated by brassinosteroid (BR) signaling [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Xu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] also found that overexpression of the cotton &#x3B1;-expansin gene <italic>GhEXPA1</italic> in either <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or cotton led to a substantial increase in the number of siliques or bolls, and an increase in leaves and seed sizes, leading to higher seed production. In this study, we found that transgenic tobacco had more capsules and higher seed production, even though the seed size itself was similar between the WT and transgenic tobacco plants (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g005">5</xref>) and there were no significant changes in vegetative and reproductive growth patterns.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> enhanced the drought tolerance of the transgenic tobacco plants</title>
        <p>Because the most obvious increase in <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression resulted from PEG-induced water stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), we examined the involvement of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> in plant drought tolerance. We observed that overexpressing <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> confers water stress tolerance on transgenic tobacco seedlings by means of higher germination rates and longer primary roots, as well as more lateral roots under water stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Moreover, the higher survival rate and improved growth phenotype indicated that the drought tolerance of the transgenic tobacco plants was superior to that of WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">Fig 7A&#x2013;7D</xref>). The photosynthetic parameters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">Fig 7E&#x2013;7G</xref> demonstrate that the transgenic plants maintained higher chlorophyll content, Pn, E, and Gs under drought stress conditions than the WT plants, and this finding suggests an improved drought tolerance in the transgenic plants compared with the WT plants. These results support the hypothesis that overexpression of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> enhanced the drought tolerance of the transgenic tobacco plants.</p>

        <title>Osmotic adjustment and a larger root system, as well as enhanced oxidative competence, conferred drought tolerance on the transgenic tobacco plants</title>
        <p>Plants resist drought by several means, including: (a) escaping drought by having a short life cycle or developmental adaptability; (b) avoiding drought through improved water uptake and reduced water loss; and (c) tolerating drought through osmotic adjustment, antioxidant capacity, and aridness tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our results suggest that several mechanisms are involved in improving drought resistance in <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants.</p>
        <p>First, the observed higher germination rate is evidence of developmental plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Under drought stress, earlier complete germination is beneficial to plants in that it allows them to escape from adverse environments.</p>
        <p>Second, the larger root system of the transgenic plants (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g006">6C&#x2013;6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">7D</xref>) may take up more water under finite water conditions and so boost drought avoidance. Plant root systems are critical organs that are necessary for acquiring water and nutrients, for responding to abiotic signals derived from the soil, and for allowing plants to survive in different ecological niches [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Water absorption is the central function of the root system and it occurs primarily through root hairs, which, as a result of their density, constitute a large absorption surface [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. After drought stress, the survival roots of transgenic lines were more extensive than those of WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Third, the overexpression of <italic>TaEXPPA2</italic> enhanced the drought tolerance of the transgenic tobacco plants in at least two respects: osmotic adjustment and antioxidant capacity. The transgenic plants had higher relative water content and lower water potential values than WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). Proline, as an osmotic adjustment component, plays an important role in plant adaptation to stresses caused by various environmental stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Under osmotic stress conditions, the proline content of <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing plants was evidently higher than in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In addition, less water was clearly lost in transgenic plants than in WT plants at all of the time points measured within 6 h of dehydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). With regard to the apparent disagreement between the lower water loss rate in transgenic plants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, and the higher transpiration rate (E) and Gs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">Fig 7G and 7H</xref>, we suggest that transgenic plants can absorb more water through their larger roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) and can also hold more water by osmotic adjustment under water stress conditions, even considering the greater Gs and E.</p>
        <p>By contrast, drought stress leads to the overproduction of ROS. ROS have an adverse effect on cell growth by oxidizing lipids, proteins, and DNA [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. There is ample evidence that antioxidative systems are involved in plant drought tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Levels of the cytomembrane lipid peroxidation product MDA are currently measured to indicate lipid peroxidation levels [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Compared to WT plants, the MDA content in transgenic plants was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Similar results were observed in relative electrical conductivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing tobacco, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> were present at low levels under drought stress, as revealed by DAB and NBT staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g009">Fig 9C&#x2013;9E</xref>). The low level of ROS in the transgenic tobacco plants was related to the high activity of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), POD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g010">Fig 10B</xref>), and CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g010">Fig 10C</xref>) under drought stress conditions, with APX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g010">Fig 10D</xref>) as an exception. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), together with monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), removes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through the Halliwell-Asada pathway [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The activity levels of MDHAR and DHAR were also higher in the transgenic plants than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also examined the expression levels of some antioxidant-related genes in transgenic plants, including <italic>NtSOD</italic>, <italic>NtCA</italic>, <italic>NtRbohD</italic>, <italic>NtCAT1</italic>, <italic>NtAPX1</italic>, and <italic>NtGPX</italic>. The expression levels of some of these genes changed in a variety of ways. Notably, the expression level of <italic>NtSOD</italic> dramatically increased, consistent with the SOD activity, suggesting that <italic>NtSOD</italic> may play an important role in the improved antioxidative systems of the transgenic tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g011">Fig 11</xref>).</p>

        <p>With respect to the functions of <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> and <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>, there are at least three similarities. First, they are both cell wall proteins and are located in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g002">Fig 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Second, the overexpression of both of them improves drought stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco, and this occurs by similar mechanisms in both cases [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For instance, <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing tobacco plants developed more extensive survival roots under drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g007">Fig 7</xref>), and root-specific expression of <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> similarly produced a larger root system [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Third, compared with the WT plants, no significant changes were observed in the seed size of the transgenic tobacco plants when they were overexpressing either <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> or <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153494.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153494.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also noted differences between <italic>TaEXPB23</italic>- and <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing tobacco plants. First, their mRNA transcription expression characteristics in wheat are not the same. The highest <italic>TaEXPA2</italic> expression was in leaf and was induced by drought stress, whereas <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> exhibited its highest transcription level in wheat coleoptiles and was up-regulated by MeJA and salt, not drought stress [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Second, the phenotype of the two kinds of transgenic tobacco was different, with <italic>TaEXPA2</italic>-overexpressing lines increasing seed production and the number of capsules, but with unchanged developmental patterns, whereas <italic>TaEXPB23</italic> overexpression resulted in evident phenotypic alterations, such as advanced jointing and flowering stages, larger leaves, and a longer internode length [<xref rid="pone.0153494.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
