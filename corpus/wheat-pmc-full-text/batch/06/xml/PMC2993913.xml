      <abstract>
        <p>Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) confers protection against a variety of oxidant-induced cell and tissue injury in animals and plants. In this report, it is confirmed that programmed cell death (PCD) in wheat aleurone layers is stimulated by GA and prevented by ABA. Meanwhile, HO activity and HO-1 protein expression exhibited lower levels in GA-treated layers, whereas the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) content was apparently increased. The pharmacology approach illustrated that scavenging or accumulating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> either delayed or accelerated GA-induced PCD. Furthermore, pretreatment with the HO-1 specific inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), before exposure to GA, not only decreased HO activity but also accelerated GA-induced PCD significantly. The application of the HO-1 inducer, haematin, and the enzymatic reaction product of HO, carbon monoxide (CO) aqueous solution, both of which brought about a noticeable induction of HO expression, substantially prevented GA-induced PCD. These effects were reversed when ZnPPIX was added, suggesting that HO <italic>in vivo</italic> played a role in delaying PCD. Meanwhile, catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities or transcripts were enhanced by haematin, CO, or bilirubin (BR), the catalytic by-product of HO. This enhancement resulted in a decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and a delay in PCD. In addition, the antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), dithiothreitol (DTT), and ascorbic acid (AsA) were able not only to delay PCD but also to mimic the effects of haematin and CO on HO up-regulation. Overall, the above results suggested that up-regulation of HO expression delays PCD through the down-regulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cereal endosperm consists of two distinct tissues: the starchy endosperm and the surrounding aleurone layer. The death of aleurone cells is described as a form of programmed cell death (PCD) following germination, which is tightly regulated by GA and ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bethke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Evidence further suggests that the second messengers or modulators, such as cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO), are involved in hormone-induced PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bethke and Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamotte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). For example, the reduction of nitrite to NO can be achieved non-enzymatically at acidic pH values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bethke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This reaction occurs in the apoplast of barley aleurone layer cells in response to GA or ABA, two hormones that acidify the apoplastic medium. It has also been reported that catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), pivotal enzymes for ROS removal, decrease significantly, while substrate hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) increases remarkably as early events of the PCD process, thereby representing a hallmark of cells that have activated a suicide programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Locato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>)<bold>.</bold> Therefore, knowledge of how these second messengers or modulators interact is crucial in gaining a better understanding of fundamental plant growth and developmental processes.</p>
      <p>The haem oxygenase (HO; EC 1.14.99.3) system is the rate-limiting step in the conversion of haem into biliverdin (BV), carbon monoxide (CO), and free iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>). Biliverdin is subsequently reduced by cytosolic biliverdin reductase to form the potent antioxidant bilirubin (BR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilks, 2002</xref>). To date, three isoforms of mammalian HO protein have been identified: HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3. Under physiological conditions, HO-1, the sole inducible 32 kDa isoform, is highly expressed in liver and spleen; HO-2 is a constitutive 36 kDa isoform, which is expressed mainly in the brain and testis; and HO-3 is a 33 kDa isoform that closely resembles HO-2. Many putative <italic>HO</italic> genes or corresponding proteins, such as those found in animals, have been identified from different plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, soybean, tomato, potato, <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, rice, corn, sorghum, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekhawat and Verma, 2010</xref>). For example, the first map-based cloning of the <italic>Arabidopsis HO</italic> gene is <italic>HY1</italic>, and the product of the <italic>HY1</italic> gene shows significant similarities to animal HOs and contains a possible transit peptide for transport to plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Recent results show that four members of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HOs cluster into two subfamilies: HY1 (HO1), HO3, and HO4 belong to the HO-1 subfamily, while HO2 is the only member of the HO-2 subfamily, which is unable to bind or degrade haem; therefore it is not a true HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gisk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). More recently, the wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) HO-1 gene was cloned from total RNA prepared from seedlings. It has been named <italic>TaHO1</italic> and is currently deposited in GenBank with the accession number HM014348. The <italic>TaHO1</italic> gene encodes a single open reading frame of 288 amino acids, with a predicated molecular mass of 31.5 kDa. This includes a 63 amino acid transit peptide, predicting a mature protein of 26 kDa following cleavage of the transit peptide. Expression analysis further showed that the <italic>TaHO1</italic> gene was expressed in leaves, seeds, roots, and aleurone layers.</p>
      <p>In animals and plants, evidence has accumulated showing that the expression of HO-1 is triggered by diverse stress-inducing stimuli, including hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motterlini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), salinity stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noriega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balestrasse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keyse and Tyrrell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yannarelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), ROS such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noriega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xuan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). For example, compared with the NaCl-free control, salinity stress results in the inhibition of HO activity as well as decreased rice seed germination. By contrast, the combination with the HO-1 inducer haematin could reverse the above responses. Consequently, biological functions of HO-1 protein or corresponding genes are believed to be associated with a fundamental adaptive and defensive response against oxidative stress and cellular stress, both in animals and in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motterlini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noriega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekhawat and Verma, 2010</xref>). Normally, the protective effects of HO-1 in plants result from enzyme actions. For example, CO aqueous solution applied exogenously, results in a mitigation of the salinity-induced inhibition of wheat root growth and delays PCD, both of which have been related to a decrease in superoxide anion production via up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and down-regulation of NADPH oxidase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, it still remains to be determined whether endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> participates in the HO/CO signal transduction pathway.</p>
      <p>Although HO can have many, often disparate, effects on plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekhawat and Verma, 2010</xref>), there is so far little information demonstrating that endogenous HO acts as a modulator of plant growth and development. In this investigation, two complementary approaches were simultaneously carried out to address the functional significance of endogenous HO in GA-induced PCD. First, HO activity was inhibited by a specific competitive inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPPIX), which was pretreated 6 h prior to different treatments. In the second approach, the HO-1 inducer haematin or the catalytic product of HO, CO aqueous solution, was applied to induce HO activity or HO-1 expression. Compared with the control sample, it was found that GA-induced PCD, which took place significantly after 36 h of treatment in wheat aleurone layers, was preceded by a substantial decrease after a slight rise of HO activity at 12 h of incubation. On the other hand, significant up-regulation of HO by ABA alone, haematin, or CO aqueous solution plus GA treatment contributed to the delay of PCD, which was reversed by the addition of ZnPPIX, respectively. This suggests that HO <italic>in vivo</italic> plays a role in delaying PCD. The interrelationship between HO up-regulation and endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was also studied. Finally, three PCD-blocking antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), dithiothreitol (DTT), and ascorbic acid (AsA), could mimic the effect of haematin and CO on HO up-regulation, further confirming that endogenous HO may act as an antioxidant in the aleurone layers.</p>

        <p>All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. GA was used at 5 &#x3BC;M and 50 &#x3BC;M. ABA was used at 50 &#x3BC;M. Haematin (Ht) was used at concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 &#x3BC;M. ZnPPIX, a specific inhibitor of HO-1, was used at 100 &#x3BC;M. 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) was used at 100 &#x3BC;M as an inhibitor of CAT. A &#x2018;suicide&#x2019; inhibitor of APX <italic>p</italic>-aminophenol (<italic>p</italic>-AP) was used at 1 mM. N,N'-dimethylthiourea (DMTU, Fluka) was chosen as a scavenger of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at concentration of 5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The fluorescent probes FDA and FM 4-64 were purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. and Invitrogen (Molecular Probes), respectively. Three well-known antioxidants BHT, DTT (Merck), and AsA, were used at 100 &#x3BC;M, 5 mM, and 5 mM, respectively.</p>

        <title>CO aqueous solution treatment</title>
        <p>The preparation of the CO aqueous solution was carried out according to the method described in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xuan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this experiment, CO-saturated aqueous solution was freshly produced by bubbling CO gas gently through a glass tube into 50 ml of 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) for at least 20 min, a duration long enough to saturate the solution with CO. The saturated stock solution (100% saturation) was then diluted immediately with 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution to the concentrations required [0.1, 1, and 10% (v/v)].</p>

        <title>Preparation of wheat aleurone layers</title>
        <p>Aleurone layers were prepared from de-embryonated wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> &#x2018;Yangmai 13&#x2019;) grains as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mrva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The de-embryonated half-grains were briefly surface-sterilized in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 20 min, and rinsed extensively with sterile water several times. The de-embryonated half-grains were then imbibed in sterile water at 25&#xB1;1 &#xB0;C for 48 h. Aleurone layers were isolated from the imbibed grain by removing the starchy endosperm under sterile conditions. Isolated aleurone layers were preincubated with water (&#x2013;ZnPPIX) or with ZnPPIX (+ZnPPIX) at 100 &#x3BC;M for 6 h, and/or incubated directly in a medium containing 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 or 50 &#x3BC;M GA or 50 &#x3BC;M ABA alone, or in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of haematin (Ht), different saturations of CO aqueous solution, 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 100 &#x3BC;M BHT, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM AsA, 100 &#x3BC;M 3-AT, 1 mM <italic>p</italic>-AP, 5 mM DMTU, or 10 &#x3BC;M each of FeSO<sub>4</sub> (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and BR for the indicated time. Layers incubated in 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> alone were regarded as the control (Con).</p>

        <title>Determination of cell viability and death</title>
        <p>The number of live and dead cells was determined by double staining with FDA (2 &#x3BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 15 min, followed by FM 4-64 (20 &#x3BC;M in 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 3 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bethke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Aleurone layers were observed with a fluorescent microscope (Axio Imger A1; Carl Zeiss, Germany) using a &#xD7;20 objective. Images of the fluorescent signal were captured using a digital camera. Randomly selected fields from at least four different aleurone layers per treatment were counted to determine the percentage of live cells.</p>

        <title>Determination of enzymatic activity</title>
        <p>Haem oxygenase (HO), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were analysed using the methods described in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The supernatant was desalted by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration to remove possible interfering materials, and used as the crude enzyme extract. For the HO activity assay, the concentration of BV was estimated using a molar absorption coefficient at 650 nm of 6.25 mM<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in 0.1 M HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.2). One unit of activity (U) was calculated by taking the quantity of the enzyme to produce 1 nmol BV per 30 min. CAT activity was spectrophotometrically measured by monitoring the consumption of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (extinction coefficient 39.4 mM<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) at 240 nm. APX activity was determined by monitoring the decrease at 290 nm (extinction coefficient 2.8 mM<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). One unit (U) of CAT or APX was defined as the decomposition of 1 &#x3BC;mol H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or AsA min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. &#x3B1;-Amylase activity in the aleurone incubation medium was measured using the previously reported starch&#x2013;iodine procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones and Varner, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p>

        <title>Western blotting analysis for HO-1</title>
        <p>Rabbit polyclonal antibody was made against the mature wheat HO-1 with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. Homogenates obtained for the HO activity assays were also analysed by Western blotting. Fifty micrograms of protein from homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% acrylamide resolving gel (Mini Protean II System, Bio-Rad, Hertz, UK). Separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and non-specific binding of antibodies was blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 &#xB0;C, with primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBS buffer plus 1% non-fat dried milk. Immune complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. The colour was developed with a solution containing 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as HRP substrate.</p>

        <p>Aleurone layers (10) were harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated by grinding with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle until a fine powder appeared and by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. DNA-free total RNA (5 &#x3BC;g) from different treatments was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis in a 20 &#x3BC;l reaction volume containing 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase XL (TaKaRa) and 2.5 &#x3BC;M random primer. PCR was performed using 2 &#x3BC;l of a 2-fold dilution of the cDNA, 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, and 1 unit of <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (TaKaRa) in a 25 &#x3BC;l reaction volume.</p>
        <p>cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: for <italic>HO-1</italic> (accession number HM014348), forward (5&#x2032;-TCAATGTCCAGCAGTGTCGC-3&#x2032;) and reverse (5&#x2032;-GCTAAACGCTTGTGAGGTAG-3&#x2032;), amplifying a 595 bp fragment; for <italic>CAT</italic> (accession no.

        <title>GA-induced PCD in wheat aleurone layers was prevented by the HO-1 inducer haematin or CO aqueous solution</title>
        <p>In accordance with previously reported results on barley aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bethke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), the time-course treatments for 48 h confirmed that compared with the control sample, PCD in the wheat aleurone layers was stimulated by GA, with a maximal response at 50 &#x3BC;M, which is different from the effective GA concentration (5 &#x3BC;M) reported in wheat layers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic> (1996)</xref>, and prevented by 50 &#x3BC;M ABA treatment, respectively (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq261/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). As determined by simultaneously staining living and dead cells with the fluorescent probes fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and <italic>N</italic>-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-[4-(diethylamino) phenyl] hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (FM 4-64, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), approximately 1% and 7% of the cells died when wheat aleurone layers were incubated in 50 &#x3BC;M ABA and CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution alone (Con) after 48 h, compared with about 61% and 87% of the cells that died in 5 &#x3BC;M and 50 &#x3BC;M GA treatments, respectively. Results of oxygen consumption (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq261/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) illustrated that relative O<sub>2</sub> consumption was increased by 10% after 48 h of incubation in the ABA-treated aleurone layer with respect to the control (Con) sample, whereas, 50 &#x3BC;M or 5 &#x3BC;M GA-treated samples decreased up to 81% and 42%, respectively. Therefore, 50 &#x3BC;M each of GA and ABA were chosen throughout the study.</p>
        <p>The responses of HO activity to GA and ABA were also investigated. An induction of HO activity peaked significantly at 12 h with ABA treatment, followed by a gradual decrease. However, this maintained a higher level of HO activity compared with the control treatment during the 48 h period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), whereas GA treatment brought about a substantial decrease during 24&#x2013;48 h of incubation (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05 or 0.01, respectively) after an obvious rise of HO activity at 12 h. Meanwhile, GA-induced PCD took place significantly after 36 h of treatment in wheat aleurone layers (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq261/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), suggesting that HO inhibition preceded PCD.</p>

        <title>Up-regulation of HO caused by haematin and CO aqueous solution</title>
        <p>The ameliorating effects of the HO-1 inducer haematin or the CO aqueous solution on GA-induced death of wheat aleurone cells described above prompted us to assess if induction of HO is associated with the above responses. In the following experiments, wheat aleurone layer cells were tested for HO accumulation, through semi-quantitative RT-PCR, enzymatic activity determination, and immunoblot analysis. Based on the results, GA treatment significantly decreased the level of HO-1 mRNA with respect to the ABA-treated sample, by contrast, haematin or CO plus GA reversed the effect of GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). HO activity decreased as much as 44.6% after 12 h of incubation in GA-treated aleurone layers compared with ABA-treated samples. An increase close to 83.9% was assessed in incubations carried out in the presence of GA plus haematin. Application of GA plus the CO aqueous solution brought about 62.1% higher HO activity compared with the sample that was treated with GA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Western blot analysis for HO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>) showed only a single band with a molecular mass of 26 kDa as determined using molecular mass markers (data not shown). This mass is approximately consistent to a previously reported result for mature HO1 of pea and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

        <title>Decrease of HO activity contributes to PCD in wheat aleurone layers</title>
        <p>ZnPPIX, the potent HO-1 inhibitor, has been found to inhibit HO activity in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xuan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2008</xref>). To investigate the physiological function of HO in plant response to PCD, the effects of ZnPPIX on the responses of ABA, GA with or without haematin, or CO aqueous solution were assessed. In this study, it was confirmed that ZnPPIX inhibited HO activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, B). Comparatively, pretreatment with 100 &#x3BC;M ZnPPIX brought about fewer inhibitory effects on HO activity in ABA-treated samples compared with GA-treated aleurone layers, which led to the complete inhibition of HO activity. In the following experiments, the addition of 100 &#x3BC;M ZnPPIX notably prevented any further inducible action of 10 &#x3BC;M haematin, or 1.0% saturation of CO aqueous solution plus GA treatment on increased HO activity after a 12 h treatment (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Meanwhile, incubation of GA-treated aleurone layers in haematin (GA+Ht) or CO (GA+CO) dramatically reduced the rate of PCD as measured with fluorescence microscopy, and the above aleurone cell death was aggravated by the application of ZnPPIX, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>, D). For example, no cells died 42 h after incubation with ABA, compared with only 27% of cells that remained alive in aleurone layers incubated in GA alone. Meanwhile, 46% of cells in GA+Ht and 43% in GA+CO remained alive. After preincubation with ZnPPIX, about 7% and 90% of the cells died in ABA- or GA-treated samples, respectively, suggesting that endogenous HO plays a role in delaying PCD in wheat aleurone layers. Furthermore, cell death in the pretreatment of ZnPPIX brought about 63% and 67% death in GA+Ht and GA+CO samples, respectively. These values are higher than those found for corresponding samples without the addition of ZnPPIX, further confirming that the effect of haematin or CO on PCD is mediated specifically by the up-regulation of HO activity. The changes of PCD after 18 h of incubation exhibited a similar tendency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Three PCD-blocking antioxidants mimic the effect of haematin and CO on HO up-regulation</title>
        <p>BHT, DTT, and AsA are efficient antioxidants and reactive oxygen species scavengers. Previous work shows that BHT could slow down GA-induced PCD in barley aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). This observation has been extended in this report. When wheat aleurone layers were stained with fluorescent probes, the cytoprotective effects of BHT, DTT, and AsA became apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, B; some data not shown). For instance, after 48 h in GA treatment, 87% of cells died, and more than 47%, 41%, and 33% remained alive in aleurone layers incubated with GA plus DTT, BHT, and AsA, respectively. However, no significant difference of cell death was discovered in the ABA-treated samples with or without DTT.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether HO is associated with the response of these antioxidants leading to a delay of PCD, detailed studies were conducted on HO activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>), <italic>HO-1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>), and the expression of HO-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>, F). Results showed that the level of HO activity was increased by 81.8% after 12 h of GA plus DTT treatment with respect to control values (GA-treated alone sample, Con). When BHT or AsA was added to GA, these resulted in 67.2% and 58.1% enhancement, respectively. Meanwhile, ABA in the presence of the above antioxidants respectively led to similar inducible tendencies toward the changes of HO enzyme activity. <italic>HO-1</italic> transcript and its protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D&#x2013;F</xref>) were approximately modulated in parallel with the levels of HO activity and PCD.

        <title>Regulation of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modulates PCD and HO expression in wheat aleurone layers</title>
        <p>ROS are linked to the promotion of PCD in barley aleurone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bethke and Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The increasing sensitivity of GA-treated barley aleurone cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bethke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palma and Kermode, 2003</xref>) suggests the existence of a possible interrelationship between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HO expression during GA-induced PCD process. To test this hypothesis, ABA- and GA-treated aleurone cells were exposed to 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, after which the cell viability and HO expression was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). In our test, GA or ABA treatment led to the sensitization of wheat aleurone layers to 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment for 48 h with 100% and 13% dead cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In comparison, about 87% and 1% of the cells died in samples that were treated with just GA or ABA, respectively. Biochemical tests also showed that the above-mentioned H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment brought about significantly decreased HO activity, <italic>HO-1</italic> transcript, and HO-1 protein expression in both GA or ABA treatments (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>The potential roles of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in GA-induced PCD were investigated using CAT and APX inhibitors. Treatment of aleurone layers with the CAT inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) at 100 &#x3BC;M, a concentration deemed effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Havir, 1992</xref>), had a significant inducible effect on GA-induced PCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). A &#x2018;suicide&#x2019; inhibitor of APX, <italic>p</italic>-aminophenol (<italic>p</italic>-AP, 1 mM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Asada, 1990</xref>), displayed slightly pronounced effects. GA-induced PCD and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> overproduction were substantially reversed by the scavenger of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> N,N'-dimethylthiourea (DMTU, 5 mM). Further, analogous effects were observed when the above-mentioned chemicals were combined with ABA. These results also confirmed that changes of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are likely to be involved in GA-induced PCD in wheat aleurone layers, and that both CAT- and APX-mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition play important roles in this process.</p>

        <title>GA-induced down-regulation of APX and CAT expression, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> overproduction were reversed by haematin and CO</title>
        <p>A previous study has reported that GA-treated aleurone cells lose their ability to scavenge ROS, and that this loss ultimately results in oxidative damage and PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The following experiment investigated the response of APX and CAT enzyme activities, corresponding transcripts, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. GA treatment led to a declining trend in the activity or mRNA expression of APX and CAT during the 48 h incubation period; by comparison, ABA brought about an increased tendency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>, B). Comparatively, preincubation with ZnPPIX produced a decrease in the two enzyme activities compared with the values obtained when only ABA or GA was applied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>, B).

        <title>Effects of BR and Fe<sup>2+</sup> on APX and CAT activities, aleurone cell viability, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production</title>
        <p>A previous result has shown that oxidative stress provoked by cadmium (Cd) could be partially prevented by the addition of BV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noriega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In this test, the behaviour of the CO aqueous solution as an inducer for the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes prompted the investigation of whether BR and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, the other end-products of HO activity, could perform similar effects. To explore this possibility, Fe<sup>2+</sup> or BR was added together with GA, after which it was found that the two chemicals displayed different effects on APX and CAT activities, aleurone cell viability, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production induced by GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). For example, activities of APX in aleurone cells differentially increased after 12 h and 48 h of GA plus 10 &#x3BC;M BR treatment, being 55.4% and 822.1% higher than those of BR-free control samples (GA-treated alone). CAT activities were also increased by 31.3% and 681.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the rate of PCD significantly decreased (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8C</xref>), and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level declined because H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in wheat aleurone layers were reduced by 49.1% and 36.0% with respect to corresponding samples that were treated with GA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>). Reversed responses of APX and CAT activities, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production were observed when ZnPPIX was pretreated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, the samples treated with Fe<sup>2+</sup> exhibited weaker or negative effects.</p>

        <title>Changes of &#x3B1;-amylase activity</title>
        <p>To evaluate if delayed or aggravated PCD could result from a global inhibition or induction of GA-induced responses, the time-course of &#x3B1;-amylase secretion was investigated in wheat aleurone layers upon various treatments. As expected, GA stimulated the secretion of &#x3B1;-amylase, while ABA inhibited it (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq261/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). When haematin, CO aqueous solution, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and DMTU were incubated with GA during the 48 h period, the total &#x3B1;-amylase activities were not less than that from layers treated with GA alone, while BR, 3-AT, and <italic>p</italic>-AP, respectively, brought about equal amounts or a slight decrease of &#x3B1;-amylase activity. Therefore, these results suggest that corresponding pharmacological effects of the above-mentioned chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig6 fig8">Figs 2, 4, 6, 8</xref>) appear to be primarily on PCD.</p>

        <title>Up-regulation of HO contributes to the delay of PCD in aleurone layers</title>
        <p>The present study provides evidence, for the first time in plants, that up-regulation of HO contributes to the delay of PCD in wheat aleurone layers. First, HO inhibition preceded PCD in GA-treated aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq261/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), and there was a strong correlation between the modulation of the amounts of HO-1 protein, <italic>HO-1</italic> transcript, or HO activity, and the corresponding responses of PCD. For example, the activities of HO, <italic>HO-1</italic> transcript, and HO-1 protein expression significantly decreased in GA-treated aleurone layers compared with those of ABA-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating a possible interrelationship between HO expression and PCD in aleurone layers. When ZnPPIX, a specific inhibitor of HO-1, proven in wheat aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, B), was preincubated with cells that were later incubated in GA, PCD became accelerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results suggest that endogenous HO might play a role in delaying PCD.</p>
        <p>In human monocytes, HO-1 mRNA is induced by hemin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Treatment with exogenous CO stimulates the expression of manganese SOD and HO in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In our experiments, the exogenous HO-1 inducer, haematin, or the CO aqueous solution, both of which brought about a noticeable induction of HO expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), ameliorated GA-induced PCD, with a maximal biological response at 10 &#x3BC;M haematin and 1% saturation of CO aqueous solution during the 48 h period of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, the effects of haematin and CO on cell viability and HO expression can be mimicked by the antioxidants BHT, DTT, and AsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), further confirming that up-regulation of HO can act as a potent antioxidative enzyme responsible for the protection of plant cells from oxidative stress. A similar finding has previously been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>, in which they have observed that BHT could imitate the effect of NO donors and slow down GA-induced PCD in barley aleurone layers. The results mentioned above also indicate that maintenance of higher level HO expression in aleurone layers is critical in the delay of PCD, and that HO down-regulation is closely associated with the subsequent PCD. The observations that treatment with GA and 100 &#x3BC;M ZnPPIX can fully inhibit HO activity, speed up PCD in aleurone layer cells, and that these effects were reversed by haematin or CO aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), are in line with this proposition.</p>
        <p>Cytoprotective roles of HO in animals and plants have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulak and J&#xF3;zkowicz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our data illustrate that up-regulation of HO can delay GA-mediated PCD in wheat aleurone layers. This could be ascribed to the capability of HO to act as a novel antioxidative enzyme, which has previously been proven in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noriega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yannarelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The above protective effects of HO might also be derived from the products of its enzyme catalytic actions. For example, the generation of CO has been found to display antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otterbein <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and CO applied exogenously mitigates salinity-induced PCD in wheat primary roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition, BV and BR have antioxidant and cytoprotective effects that may enhance the effects of HO-1 in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stocker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noriega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). A similar phenomenon was also observed when BR was added with GA in wheat aleurone layers, whereas Fe<sup>2+</sup> did not induce such effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). It has been shown that, although BV is converted to BR by biliverdin reductase, BR can be recycled to BV, providing a powerful redox cycle in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Thus, whether BV is also involved in the above cytoprotective effects, requires further elucidation.</p>
        <p>In animals, the cellular content of haem, derived either from the delivery of filtered haem proteins such as haemoglobin and myoglobin, or from the breakdown of ubiquitous intracellular haem proteins, is regulated via the HO enzyme system, thereby exhibiting various physiological roles. In a previous study, induction of endogenous HO-1 protein with the infusion of haemoglobin increased survival in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otterbein <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Among haem proteins, haemoglobin exists widely in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and the presence of haemoglobin in aleurone layers has also been discovered. Previous results have shown that CO can strongly enhance haemoglobin gene expression in barley aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nie and Hill, 1997</xref>), and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a major role in the signal transduction pathway leading to haemoglobin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Non-symbiotic haemoglobin AHb1 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has been confirmed to scavenge NO and reduce NO emission under hypoxic stress, indicating its role in NO detoxification in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dordas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perazzolli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Given that NO may be an endogenous modulator of the delay of PCD in barley aleurone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), it is speculated that the up-regulation of HO expression might not only compensate for the lower level of NO due to the induction of haemoglobin expression, but also contribute to the delay of PCD in wheat aleureone layers.</p>

        <title>The decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by haematin or CO is involved in delay of GA-induced PCD</title>
        <p>ROS have been linked to the death of cells in many mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jabs, 1999</xref>), and have also been implicated in the death of plant cells in response to a variety of stimuli, including pathogen invasion and some environmental stresses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fath <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> showed that ABA maintains high CAT, APX, and SOD expressions to scavenge ROS, and then prevents PCD in barley aleurone layers, whereas GA brings about rapid reduction in these antioxidant enzyme activities and promotes cell death. Therefore, it was investigated whether up-regulation of HO leading to a delay of PCD in aleurone layers is related to the modulation of ROS production or metabolism. Compared with that of the ABA treatment in wheat aleurone layers, the overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis in response to GA was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). These processes are correlated to the biological response of GA-stimulated PCD or ABA-prevented PCD. The pharmacology approach also illustrated that scavenging or the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> delayed or accelerated GA-induced PCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Meanwhile, the incubation of wheat aleurone layers in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing media (1 mM) resulted in the total death of GA-treated but not ABA-treated aleurone cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, B). This outcome is consistent with the results in barley aleurone layers reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bethke and Jones (2001)</xref>, in which GA-treated aleurone protoplasts are less able than ABA-treated protoplasts to tolerate internally generated or exogenously applied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yannarelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), after the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the decreased HO expression became more noticeable in GA-treated aleurone layers than in ABA-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>, D). These results are consistent with the responses of cell death, suggesting that interaction between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HO is implicated in GA-induced PCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bethke and Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using the HO-1 knockout mice and inhibitor test, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> have confirmed that CO and BV produced from HO-1 suppresses ROS production generated from NADPH oxidase. Meanwhile, CO can suppress the catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that are responsible for the endogenous generation of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kyokane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In our subsequent experiment, results revealed that, in wheat aleurone layers, application of exogenous haematin and CO aqueous solution not only induced HO expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), but also slowed down the GA-induced decrease of CAT and APX activities or their transcripts in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), thus leading to the significant decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>). These findings are consistent with those reported in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and animals by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Turkseven <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>, in which they found that the vascular cytoprotective mechanism of HO-1 against oxidative stress requires an increase in extracellular SOD and CAT expression, thus leading to an improvement in vascular relaxation in diabetic rats. Meanwhile, the delay of PCD was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Overall, an increased ability to scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may contribute to the delay of GA-induced PCD in wheat aleurone layer cells treated with haematin or CO aqueous solution by reducing the degree of oxidative stress, because ROS, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide anion, play a central role in promoting PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bethke and Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and ROS are likely targets of BHT, NO, haematin, CO, and BR in plant and animal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beligni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Our results also suggested that BR rather than Fe<sup>2+</sup>, can significantly suppress the increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in GA-treated wheat aleurone layers by enhancing APX and CAT activities at both 12 h and 48 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this work expanded our previous investigations concerning the physiological roles of the HO/CO system in plants, and illustrated that the delay of PCD was induced by the up-regulation of HO expression. This result also strongly indicates that the antioxidative role of HO involves an alteration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> metabolism. However, further genetic evidence is required unequivocally to elucidate corresponding mechanisms or signal transduction pathways.</p>
