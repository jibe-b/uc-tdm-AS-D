      <abstract>
        <p>Drought, salinity and low temperatures are major factors limiting crop productivity and quality. Sucrose non-fermenting1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) plays a key role in abiotic stress signaling in plants. In this study, <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic>, a SnRK2 member in wheat, was cloned and its functions under multi-stress conditions were characterized. Subcellular localization showed the presence of TaSnRK2.8 in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. Expression pattern analyses in wheat revealed that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> was involved in response to PEG, NaCl and cold stresses, and possibly participates in ABA-dependent signal transduction pathways. To investigate its role under various environmental stresses, <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> was transferred to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under control of the CaMV-35S promoter. Overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> resulted in enhanced tolerance to drought, salt and cold stresses, further confirmed by longer primary roots and various physiological characteristics, including higher relative water content, strengthened cell membrane stability, significantly lower osmotic potential, more chlorophyll content, and enhanced PSII activity. Meanwhile, <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants had significantly lower total soluble sugar levels under normal growing conditions, suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> might be involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, the transcript levels of ABA biosynthesis (<italic>ABA1, ABA2</italic>), ABA signaling (<italic>ABI3, ABI4, ABI5</italic>), stress-responsive genes, including two ABA-dependent genes (<italic>RD20A, RD29B</italic>) and three ABA-independent genes (<italic>CBF1, CBF2, CBF3</italic>), were generally higher in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants than in WT/<italic>GFP</italic> controls under normal/stress conditions. Our results suggest that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> may act as a regulatory factor involved in a multiple stress response pathways.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plant growth and crop production are adversely affected by environmental stresses such as extreme temperatures, drought, and high salinity. As adaptable organisms, plants have developed complex signaling networks to regulate biochemical and physiological acclimation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Bohnert1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Xiong1">[2]</xref>. Many studies have indicated the involvement of stress signaling cascades composed of second messengers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Knight1">[3]</xref>, phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Takahashi1">[4]</xref>, phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Leung1">[5]</xref> and protein kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Jonak1">[6]</xref>. However, most of the components that transduce stress signals remain to be discovered and elucidated.</p>
      <p>One of the major pathways by which extracellular stimuli are transduced into intracellular responses is the calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) signaling cascade, which is activated by ABA and other diverse stress signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Sanders1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Ludwig1">[8]</xref>. CDPK kinases are calcium-regulated and are distinguished by a structural arrangement in which a calmodulin-like regulatory domain is located at the C-terminal end of the enzyme. The sucrose non-fermenting1 (SNF1) protein kinase family, belonging to the CDPK-SnRK superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Harmon1">[9]</xref>, comprises SNF1 in yeast, AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK) in mammals, and SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) in plants. In yeast and mammals, all these kinases are involved in regulation of carbon metabolism and energy status in their respective systems, whereas in plants, they may represent interfaces between metabolic and stress signaling. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that plant SnRKs may be hubs within a network of interacting signaling pathways, rather than being components of simple signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Halford1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Halford2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Plant SnRKs are grouped into three subfamilies: SnRK1, SnRK2 and SnRK3. SnRK1 kinase is well characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels, and evidence indicates that SnRK1s have a role in global regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, whereas SnRK2 and SnRK3 mainly function in stress signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Hrabak1">[12]</xref>. In the process of plant evolution, a number of duplicated protein kinases involved in plant development may have evolved as resistance genes by selection or acquisition to address various environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Clark1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Kim1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that SnRK2 and SnRK3 originated by gene duplication of SnRK1, and then diverged rapidly during plant evolution to fulfill new roles that enabled plants to develop networks linking stress and ABA signaling with metabolic signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Halford2">[11]</xref>. The SnRK2 and SnRK3 gene subfamilies are unique to plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Halford3">[15]</xref>. To date, most studies on SnRK2 and SnRK3 kinases focus on their involvement in response to stresses. One of best studied kinases in the SnRK3 family, <italic>SOS2</italic>, which is required for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and abiotic stress tolerance is involved in responses to salt stress and ABA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Guo1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Increasing evidence shows that SnRK2 genes play crucial roles in abiotic stress response, and might be involved in diverse developmental processes in plants. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ten <italic>SnRK2s</italic> have been identified, of which five members (<italic>SnRK2.2</italic>, <italic>SnRK2.3</italic>, <italic>SnRK2.6</italic>, <italic>SnRK2.7</italic> and <italic>SnRK2.8</italic>) are activated by ABA, and all members, except <italic>SnRK2.9</italic>, could be activated by hyperosmotic and salinity stresses, whereas none was activated by cold stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Boudsocq1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Boudsocq2">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>SnRK2.8</italic> resulted in up-regulation of stress-related genes and led to enhanced drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Umezawa1">[20]</xref>. Recently, three members <italic>SRK2D/E/I</italic> were identified to function as main positive regulators of ABA signaling in response to water stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Fujita1">[21]</xref>. Similarly, 10 SnRK2s, designated <italic>SAPK1-10</italic>, were identified in rice. All were activated by hyperosmotic stress, and <italic>SAPK8-10</italic> were also activated by ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Kobayashi1">[22]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>SAPK4</italic> significantly enhanced tolerance to salt in rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Diedhiou1">[23]</xref>. Recently, ten maize SnRK2 members were cloned, and most <italic>ZmSnRK2s</italic> were induced by one or more abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Huai1">[24]</xref>. In wheat, the first SnRK2 cDNA clone, <italic>PKABA1</italic>, was isolated from an ABA-treated wheat embryo cDNA library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Anderberg1">[25]</xref>. In our recent study, the wheat <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> gene, expressed strongly in booting spindles compared to leaves, roots and spikes, was induced by multi-stresses and ABA application. Overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> resulted in delayed seedling establishment, longer primary roots and enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Mao1">[26]</xref>. Although various studies show that SnRK2s are activated rapidly in response to abiotic stresses, knowledge of specific functions of SnRK2s in wheat is fragmentary.</p>
      <p>As a world staple crop, wheat production is constrained by muti-environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity and extreme temperatures. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of abiotic stress responses is necessary for genetic improvement of stress resistance in wheat. In this study, we characterized <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> in wheat and observed its expression patterns under various abiotic stresses and in different wheat tissues. Abiotic stress tolerance assays indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> overexpressing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> significantly increased tolerance to drought, salt and cold stresses.</p>

        <p>Total soluble sugars were determined as fructose equivalents using the anthrone colorimetric assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Yemm1">[30]</xref> at 620 nm with a spectrophotometer (LG-721, BioRad). After detaching from roots, four-week-old plants were put into liquid nitrogen immediately and dehydrated in a refrigerated-vacuum evaporator at 8.1 kPa air pressure and &#x2212;60&#xB0;C for 24 h. After dehydration, samples were dried at 80&#xB0;C until a constant dry weight. Extractions were performed with 0.1 g dry material for each sample with three replications. Samples were boiled in 4 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 4 min. After filtration the extracted filtrates were transferred to volumetric flasks (5 ml) and brought to 5 ml by addition of ddH<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

        <p>For relative water content (WRA) measurements, ten 4-week-old plants with similar size in each line were detached from their roots, immediately weighed (fresh weight, FW) and then left on the laboratory bench (humidity, 45&#x2013;50%, 20&#x2013;22&#xB0;C) until there were no further losses in weight (desiccated weight). The proportions of fresh weight loss were calculated relative to the initial plant weights. The plants were finally oven-dried to a constant dry weight (DW) for 24 h at 80&#xB0;C. WRA were measured according to the formula: WRA (%)&#x200A;=&#x200A;(desiccated weight &#x2212; DW)/(FW &#x2212; DW) &#xD7;100.</p>
        <p>For osmotic potential (OP) analysis, 10 similar sized 4-week-old plants in each line were collected as a sample. OP was measured with a Micro-Osmometer (Fiske&#xAE; Model 210, Fiske&#xAE; Associates).</p>
        <p>Free proline was extracted and quantified from fresh leaves of well-watered seedlings (0.5 g) according to the ninhydrin-based colorimetric assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Hu1">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Plant cell membrane stability (CMS) was determined with a conductivity meter (DDS-1, YSI), CMS (%)&#x200A;=&#x200A;(1&#x2212; initial electrical conductivity/electrical conductivity after boiling) &#xD7;100. Ten 7-day-old seedlings (grown on 1&#xD7; MS medium, 0.8% agar) were placed on filter papers saturated with NaCl (300 mM) solution. When signs of stress began to appear on WT plants, seedlings were removed and immediately thoroughly rinsed with double distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) prior to immersion in 20 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O at room temperature. After 2 h initial conductivities of the solutions were recorded. The samples were then boiled for 30 min, cooled to room temperature, and the final conductivities were measured.</p>
        <p>Leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD value) was measured using a Minolta Chlorophyll Meter (SPAD-502) according to the Instruction Manual. SPAD values provide an indication of the relative amounts of total chlorophyll present in plant leaves, the arbitrary SPAD value can be translated to an actual value of total chlorophyll per unit area (mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) using the equation: chlorophyll content&#x200A;=&#x200A;SPAD value &#xD7;0.003&#x2013;0.048 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Xu1">[32]</xref>. Ten 4-week-old plants of each line with similar size were selected to measure chlorophyll content.</p>
        <p>Chlorophyll florescence was measured with a portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR LI-6400 XTR), and the maximum efficiencies of PSII photochemistry, Fv/Fm&#x200A;=&#x200A;(Fm-F0)/Fm, were used to assess changes in the primary photochemical reactions of the photosynthetic potential. Ten similar sized 4-week-old plants from each line were selected to determine chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. After a three-week water-withholding period, the plants were well irrigated with NaCl solution (300 mM). Chlorophyll florescence was measured before stress and 12, 24, and 36 h after stress.</p>
        <p>Stomatal conductances were measured before stress and 12, 24 and 36 h after stress with a steady state diffusion leaf porometer (Model SC-1, Decagon). Similar sized mature rosette leaves were selected for stomatal conductance determinations and the area around the merging point of the leaf transverse midline and vein was chosen as the measuring region.</p>

        <p>The <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> cDNA was 1431 bp in length, consisting of a 99 bp of 5' untranslated region, a 1101 bp open reading frame (ORF), and a 235 bp 3' untranslated region. The ORF encodes 366 deduced amino acid residues (AAR) with a calculated molecular mass of 42 kDa and a predicted pI of 4.87. Using a BLASTN search of the NCBI database, the deduced amino acid sequence showed homology with counterpart SnRK2 family members from other plant species, viz. <italic>Oriza sativa, Zea mays</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g001">Figure 1</xref>). TaSnRK2.8 has 94.8% identity to OsSAPK8, 94% to ZmSAPK8, and 76.5% to AtSnRK2.2, respectively. Scansite analysis indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> has potential serine/threonine protein kinase activities, and like other SnRK2 family members, TaSnRK2.8 showed a two domain structure, characterized by an N-terminus catalytic domain close to the SNF1/AMP kinase region and a regulatory C-terminus region in which a stretch of acidic amino acids forms a negatively charged domain. The N-terminal catalytic domain (28&#x2013;284 AAR) is highly conserved, containing an ATP binding site (34&#x2013;57 AAR) and a protein kinase activating signature (143&#x2013;155 AAR). Additionally, in the catalytic domain one potential N-myristoylation site MYRISTYL (134&#x2013;139 AAR) and one potential transmembrane spanning region (207&#x2013;224 AAR) were found. The relatively short C-terminal domain is abundant in Asp (D), and is predicted to be a coiled-coil. Compelling evidence indicated that the C-terminal domain might have a role in activation of the kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Harmon2">[34]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Huang1">[36]</xref>, and function in protein-protein interactions mainly involved in ABA responsiveness, and possibly involved in ABA signal transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Kobayashi1">[22]</xref>.</p>

After re-watering for one week, all the control plants were dead, whereas 10&#x2013;80% of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants had survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). One week after salinity treatment, almost all control plants had died, whereas <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants were still green, clear evidence that the transgenic plants were much more tolerant than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). For cold stress analysis, the plants were cultured at 4&#xB0;C. Three weeks later, differences in seedling size became evident, and <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants were larger than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Further freezing tolerance assays showed that survival rates of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants under &#x2212;2&#xB0;C, &#x2212;6&#xB0;C and &#x2212;10&#xB0;C were significantly more than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants have increased tolerance to freezing stress. These results indicated that overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> conferred enhanced tolerance to drought, salt and cold stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, a dehydration-inducible cDNA library of wheat was screened for transcripts that might be significantly up-regulated under PEG stress. The identified protein kinase gene, designated as <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic>, was cloned and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence shows high homology with counterpart SnRK2 family members from rice, maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, implying the occurrence of <italic>SnRK2.8</italic> before separation of monocots and dicots. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> is a typical subclass III SnRK2 subfamily member.</p>
      <p>N-terminal myristoylation and transmembrane spanning regions are essential for proteins to function in mediating membrane targeting and signal transduction in plant responses to environmental stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Podell1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Ishitani1">[40]</xref>. In the catalytic domain of TaSnRK2.8, one potential N-myristoylation site and one potential transmembrane spanning region were identified, strongly suggesting that TaSnRK2.8 may interact with the cell-membrane system when responding to stress. In yeast, SNF1 kinase was localized to the nucleus, vacuole, and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Vincent1">[41]</xref>, and was involved in signal transduction pathways by interacting with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to activate transcription of glucose-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Kuchin1">[42]</xref>. In the present study, the presence of TaSnRK2.8 in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus suggested that TaSnRK2.8 might have different functions in wheat. The results were confirmed through observing TaSnRK2.8-GFP-<italic>Arabidodsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016041.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and detailed location and the signal transduction pathway of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> in stressed plants remain to be determined.</p>
      <p>Numerous studies demonstrate that <italic>SnRK2.8</italic> genes are involved in response to multi-environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Umezawa1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Huai1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Kobayashi2">[43]</xref>. In this study, <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> was induced not only by NaCl, PEG and cold, but also by ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> was involved in an intricate network for multi-environmental stress responses. Comparing these expression patterns, induction of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> by PEG was more rapid than induction by ABA. This could suggest that factors other than ABA might also involve in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> induction, and/or that ABA does not induce <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> directly. In addition, the response of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> under water deficit stress is much faster than to NaCl, cold and ABA treatment. These differences also occurred at the expression level, suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> is more sensitive to drought stress.</p>
      <p>To assess the feasibility of using <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> in transgenic breeding, phenotypic traits of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants were closely monitored throughout the entire growth cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016041.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The results clearly demonstrated that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic>-overexpression does not retard plant growth, whereas it improved the root growth of transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), which could benefit the uptake of water and nutrients under osmotic stress conditions.</p>
      <p>Mammalian AMPK and yeast SNF1 act as energy-level sensors that function to regulate metabolism during low-energy conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Kemp1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Cullen1">[45]</xref>. Compelling evidence indicates that plant SnRK1 and SnRK3 proteins have roles in regulating energy metabolism and stress signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Halford2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Gong1">[46]</xref>. Until now, there has limit reports of SnRK2 function in carbohydrate metabolism. Recently, SnRK2.6 protein, clustered with TaSnRK2.8 in the same clade, subclass III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g002">Figure 2</xref>), was found to mediate the regulation of sucrose metabolism and plant growth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Zheng1">[47]</xref>. In the present study, overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> led to significantly decreased total soluble sugar content in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> might function in carbohydrate metabolism. In further research, more effort should be given to deciphering the signals and molecular mechanisms of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> in carbohydrate metabolism, especially in regard to crucial downstream substrates.</p>
      <p>Physiological indices, including WRA, CMS, OP and free proline, are typical physiological parameters for evaluating abiotic stress tolerance and resistance in crop plants. To maintain a stable intracellular environment in the presence of external environmental stresses, many plants decrease their cellular osmotic potentials through accumulation of intracellular organic osmolytes such as proline, total soluble sugar contents, glycine betaine and mannitol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Zhu1">[48]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Wang1">[50]</xref>. In our study, <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants had significantly lower OP than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), but the free proline was not significantly increased, suggesting that free proline might not account for osmolyte augmentation. In addition, <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants had significantly lower total soluble sugar contents than controls under well-watered conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g005">Figure 5</xref>), but the difference vanished very soon after exposesure to salt stress (data not shown). Therefore, total soluble sugar content was also not a cause of osmolyte augmentation. The results of WRA and CMS determinations were consistent with the OP results, and suggest that the enhanced multi-stress tolerance might be due to osmolyte augmentation. Thus, other types of osmolytes might be attributed to the enhanced OP in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants.</p>
      <p>Chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves, especially fluorescence induction patterns, is a reliable, non-invasive method for monitoring photosynthetic events and reflects the physiological status of plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Strasser1">[51]</xref>. The maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry, measured as Fv/Fm, is an direct reflection of the PSII activity, and environmental stresses are associated with decreased Fv/Fm ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Krause1">[52]</xref>. In this study, we observed smaller decreases in Fv/Fm ratios in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016041-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), and witnessed significantly higher chlorophyll contents in transformants. Thus <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants might have more robust photosynthetic capabilities than non-transformed controls.</p>
      <p>Based on the phenotypic and physiological characteristics of <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants, we speculate that the enhanced multi-stress tolerance is possibly due to an improved root system, increased capability of osmotic adjustment, and robust photosynthetic capabilities. Under osmotic stress, longer roots might facilitate <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants to absorb more water. Robust photosynthetic capability might help transgenic plants to become more vigorous, and increased osmolytes might be helpful in reducing water loss and maintaining a higher WRA in plant cells, thus leading to enhanced water retention ability, benefiting the maintenance of regular cell turgor and avoiding damage to cell membranes, consequently enhancing drought tolerance. Under cold stress, lower OP commonly means more solutes in the plant sap, resulting in lower freezing points and hence reduced cold damage.</p>
      <p>Under abiotic stresses, ABA is often recruited as the primary signal for increasing the transcription levels of the stress responsive genes. The function of <italic>ABA1, ABA2</italic> and <italic>ABA3</italic> genes in ABA biosynthesis has been well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Zeevaart1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Xiong2">[54]</xref>, and the most intensively investigated regulators of ABA signaling include several <italic>ABI</italic> genes, of which <italic>ABI1</italic> and <italic>ABI2</italic> are negative regulators, and <italic>ABI3</italic>, <italic>ABI4</italic> and <italic>ABI5</italic> regulate ABA responses positively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Leung2">[55]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-Finkelstein2">[58]</xref>. In the present study, the expressions of <italic>ABA1, ABA2</italic>, and ABA positive regulators (<italic>ABI3</italic>, <italic>ABI4</italic> and <italic>ABI5</italic>) in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants were substantially increased compared to WT plants. Therefore, it was indicated that the enhanced stress tolerance conferred by <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> overexpression may be attributed to increased ABA biosynthesis and signaling, which result in greater expression of several stress responsive genes. Moreover, it is well known that CBF genes are mainly involved in ABA independent regulation of stress responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016041-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[59]</xref>. Here, the transcript levels of <italic>CBF1</italic>, <italic>CBF2</italic> and <italic>CBF3</italic> were also significantly higher in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants than the controls, suggesting that there may be ABA independent stress signaling pathways involved in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic>-mediated stress tolerance. Meanwhile, the high transcript levels of stress responsive genes in <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> plants suggest that <italic>TaSnRK2.8</italic> may act upstream of these genes in stress tolerance and is therefore involved in a crosstalk between ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signaling networks.</p>
