      <abstract>
        <p>Phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi possess huge effector repertoires that are dominated by hundreds of sequence-unrelated small secreted proteins. The molecular function of these effectors and the evolutionary mechanisms that generate this tremendous number of singleton genes are largely unknown. To get a deeper understanding of fungal effectors, we determined by NMR spectroscopy the 3-dimensional structures of the <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> effectors AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia. Despite a lack of sequence similarity, both proteins have very similar 6 &#x3B2;-sandwich structures that are stabilized in both cases by a disulfide bridge between 2 conserved cysteins located in similar positions of the proteins. Structural similarity searches revealed that AvrPiz-t, another effector from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, and ToxB, an effector of the wheat tan spot pathogen <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> have the same structures suggesting the existence of a family of sequence-unrelated but structurally conserved fungal effectors that we named MAX-effectors (<underline><bold><italic>M</italic></bold></underline><italic>agnaporthe</italic><underline><bold>A</bold></underline>vrs and To<underline><bold>x</bold></underline>B like). Structure-informed pattern searches strengthened this hypothesis by identifying MAX-effector candidates in a broad range of ascomycete phytopathogens. Strong expansion of the MAX-effector family was detected in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> where they seem to be particularly important since they account for 5&#x2013;10% of the effector repertoire and 50% of the cloned avirulence effectors. Expression analysis indicated that the majority of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> MAX-effectors are expressed specifically during early infection suggesting important functions during biotrophic host colonization. We hypothesize that the scenario observed for MAX-effectors can serve as a paradigm for ascomycete effector diversity and that the enormous number of sequence-unrelated ascomycete effectors may in fact belong to a restricted set of structurally conserved effector families.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Fungal plant pathogens are of outstanding economic and ecological importance and cause destructive diseases on many cultivated and wild plants. Effector proteins that are secreted during infection to manipulate the host and to promote disease are a key element in fungal virulence. Phytopathogenic fungi possess huge effector repertoires that are dominated by hundreds of sequence-unrelated small secreted proteins. The molecular functions of this most important class of fungal effectors and the evolutionary mechanisms that generate this tremendous numbers of apparently unrelated proteins are largely unknown. By investigating the 3-dimensional structures of effectors from the rice blast fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, we discovered an effector family comprising structurally conserved but sequence-unrelated effectors from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and the phylogenetically distant wheat pathogen <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> that we named MAX-effectors (<underline><italic>M</italic></underline>. <italic>oryzae</italic>
<underline>A</underline>vrs and To<underline>x</underline>B). Structure-informed searches of whole genome sequence databases suggest that MAX-effectors are present at low frequencies and with a patchy phylogenetic distribution in many ascomycete phytopathogens. They underwent strong lineage-specific expansion in fungi of the <italic>Pyriculariae</italic> family that contains <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> where they seem particularly important during biotrophic plant colonization and account for 50% of the cloned Avr effectors and 5&#x2013;10% of the effector repertoire. Based on our results on the MAX-effectors and the widely accepted concept that fungal effectors evolve according to a birth-and-death model we propose the hypothesis that the majority of the immense numbers of different ascomycete effectors could in fact belong to a limited set of structurally defined families whose members are phylogenetically related.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pathogenic microorganisms have to cope with the immune system of their host and therefore deploy measures to hide their presence, disturb host immunity or inactivate defense responses. In all these strategies, proteins secreted by the pathogen during infection and acting on host proteins and cellular processes play a key role [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These proteinaceous virulence factors named effectors act either extra-cellularly or inside host cells and can possess, depending on the microorganism, very different molecular features.</p>
      <p>In fungal pathogens, the main class of effectors are small secreted proteins of less than 200 amino acids expressed specifically during infection and often rich in cysteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Genome sequencing and expression analysis identified hundreds of such effector candidates in individual plant pathogenic fungal species. Few of them, mainly those acting extra-cellularly, are widely distributed among phytopathogenic fungi and contain known motifs or domains, such as NLPs (necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (Nep1)-like proteins), LysM domain-containing proteins or protease inhibitors [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The vast majority of the fungal effectors do not share sequence similarities with other proteins and do not contain conserved motifs. This is very different from the situation in other phytopathogens and in particular oomyctes, an important class of plant pathogens that have similar lifestyles and infection strategies and whose virulence relies also on large effector repertoires. In oomycete pathogens, large families of cytoplasmic effectors with hundreds of members in individual species are defined by the presence of the RXLR or the LFLAK host cell translocation motifs [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The effector domains of these RXLR and Crinkler (CRN) effectors that mediate virulence functions are highly diversified but contain, in the majority of cases, conserved motifs or domains that are shared between effectors from the same or other species allowing their classification in distinct families. On the contrary, most fungal effectors are species-specific while few are lineage specific and occur in closely related species. In most phytopathogenic fungi, no large effector gene families were identified [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The majority of their effectors are singletons and a small proportion belongs to small paralogous groups of rarely more than 3 members. Effector repertoires dominated by gene families of large size counting more than 5 members were only detected in particular cases such as powdery mildew and rust fungi lineages [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to their high diversity and the lack of similarity with other proteins, the mode of action and the role in infection of fungal effectors have to be elucidated case by case and remain still largely unknown [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, this tremendous diversity raises the question of the evolutionary trajectories of fungal effectors that do not show traces of common origins.</p>
      <p>Rice blast disease caused by the ascomycete fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> is present in all rice growing areas and causes important harvest losses. Since rice is the main source of calories for half of the human population and since disease control strategies are frequently overcome by the pathogen due to its high genetic plasticity, blast is considered one of the most dangerous plant diseases threatening global food security and hampering attempts to increase rice yield in many parts of the world [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to its economic importance, the status of the host plant rice as a model plant and the ease of cultivation and genetic manipulation of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, blast disease has become a model for the molecular and genetic investigation of fungal plant diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular, molecular mechanisms of fungal disease development were studied intensively in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> uncovering important features of fungal virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Key steps in infection by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> are (i) penetration into epidermal cells by the breakage of the leaf cuticle and epidermal cell walls by an appressorium, a specialized unicellular structure, (ii) biotrophic growth inside the first invaded host cells, followed by (iii) necrotrophic growth associated with active killing of host tissue and the development of disease symptoms and finally, (iv) clonal reproduction and sporulation.</p>
      <p>Effectors and in particular cytoplasmic effectors are key elements in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> virulence and particularly important during the biotrophic phase of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the function of individual effectors in the infection process has only been established for the LysM effector SLP1 that sequesters chitin fragments and thereby interferes with their recognition by the rice chitin receptor CEBiP, and AvrPiz-t that interferes with host immunity by inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Mutant analysis aiming to demonstrate that individual effectors are important for virulence have often been unsuccessful, probably due to functional redundancy among effectors [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Approximately 700 of the 1300&#x2013;1500 secreted proteins encoded in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genome are considered effector candidates according to their size of less than 200 amino acids and their lack of homology to proteins of known function [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hundreds of them were found to be expressed during appressoria formation or infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>Some effectors are recognized in certain plant accessions by immune receptors localized either at the plasma membrane or in the cytosol leading to the induction of strong defense responses and resistance to pathogen isolates possessing this effector [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The recognized effector is, in these cases, named an avirulence (Avr) protein. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, 8 different effectors acting as Avr proteins named PWL2, AVR-Pia, AVR1-CO39, AVR-Pii, AVR-Pik, AvrPiz-t, AVR-Pita and Avr-Pi9 have been cloned molecularly [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

For 7 of them, the matching rice immune receptors that are in all cases cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain proteins (NLRs) have been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the present study, the 3-dimensional structures of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 were investigated to deepen our understanding of fungal effector function and diversity. NMR analysis revealed that the structures of both proteins consist of two anti-parallel &#x3B2;-sheets, each having three strands, and linked by one disulfide bond Structural similarity searches revealed that the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effector AvrPiz-t and the effector ToxB from the wheat pathogen <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repens</italic> have similar 6 &#x3B2;-sandwich structures with the same topology [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Comparisons of the structures of the four effectors that we named MAX-effectors revealed that they share a common architecture but no sequence consensus. Structure-informed and pattern-based searches identified large numbers of weakly homologous MAX-effector candidates in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic>, and limited numbers or no homologs in other phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi. Expression profiling indicated that the majority of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> MAX-effector candidates are expressed during early infection. MAX-effectors therefore seem to have undergone a lineage-specific expansion in the <italic>Pyricularia</italic> genus that may be driven by duplications and rapid adaptation to new functions involving important changes of surface properties but conservation of protein architecture. This evolutionary process has the potential to generate large families of structurally related proteins without sequence similarity and may serve as a paradigm for effector evolution and diversification in phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi.</p>

The first sheet is formed by the three &#x3B2;-strands &#x3B2;1, &#x3B2;2 and &#x3B2;6 while the second sheet contains &#x3B2;3, &#x3B2;4 and &#x3B2;5. In both cases, the two &#x3B2;-sheets pack together by an internal core of hydrophobic residues and one disulfide bridge and the structures belong to the &#x3B2;-sandwich classification. In both Avrs, the &#x3B2;-strands overlay and are similarly oriented (vide infra) but loops differ in length and structure.</p>

        <title>ToxB and AvrPiz-t are structural homologs of AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia</title>
        <p>To identify structural homologs of AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, structural similarity searches were performed using the Dali server and the Protein Data Bank [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Both queries, with AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia, identified the secreted effector protein ToxB from the wheat tan spot pathogen <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> as well as its natural allele Toxb as the closest structural homologs with the highest Z-scores (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Like, AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, ToxB is secreted during infection and is an important determinant of virulence for the tan spot fungus [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, the search with AVR1-CO39 identified AvrPiz-t, another avirulence effector of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> that is sequence-unrelated to AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 but structurally similar [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A pairwise similarity matrix using root-mean-square deviation (rmsd, measured in &#xC5;) and DALI Z-scores [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] was established revealing that all proteins are structurally related and that ToxB is closer to all other three structures than the others among them (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). ToxB and AvrPiz-t are like AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, composed of two three-stranded antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheets, &#x3B2;1-&#x3B2;2-&#x3B2;6 and &#x3B2;3-&#x3B2;4-&#x3B2;5, forming a six &#x3B2;-sandwich (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A&#x2013;3D</xref>). Structure-based sequence alignments provided by DALI revealed, at a first glance, no obvious conservation, but also no clear consensus except buried hydrophobic residues alternating with exposed polar amino acids in the &#x3B2;-strands (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). The &#x3B2;-strands &#x3B2;1 and &#x3B2;2 are very similar in length and position in all four proteins, while &#x3B2;3, &#x3B2;4 and &#x3B2;6 display more variation. &#x3B2;5 is the shortest and the most irregular strand. As expected for &#x3B2;-strands, buried and exposed residues alternate, with the exception of &#x3B2;1 where residues have a tendency to be more buried. This is due to the packing of &#x3B2;1 in between the &#x3B2;2 and &#x3B2;6 strands. The loops connecting the &#x3B2;-strands have variable length, and are the sites where most of the residue insertions occur. The disulfide bond between C2 and C43 (ToxB numbering) is well conserved but shifted &#x201C;in phase&#x201D; by two residues in AVR-Pia (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

Disulfide bonds are shown in the ribbon diagrams by orange sticks. All four structures were superimposed and a structural alignment was derived using DALI with the ToxB sequence as the reference for numbering (E). Residues not aligned to ToxB are connected by vertical lines and correspond to insertions in loops of AvrPiz-t and AVR-Pia. Triangles over the residues indicate chemical properties (upper-left triangle: yellow for hydrophobic, red for charged, pink for Asn and Gln and blue for other residues) and solvent accessibility (lower-right triangle: from black for buried to white for solvent-exposed). The consensus is defined by at least three similar residues per position. Residues forming &#x3B2;-strands are pink. Disulfide bridges in AVR1-CO39 and ToxB are shown below the consensus by a black line and for AVR-Pia by a grey line.

        <title>Psi-Blast searches identify in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> multiple effector candidates with similarities to <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> Avrs and ToxB</title>
        <p>The unexpected finding, that all three <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effectors that have been characterized for their structure so far and one effector from an only very distantly related fungal group are structurally related raised the possibility that these four effectors are members of a widely distributed and abundant fungal effector family characterized by a common &#x3B2;-sandwich structure and high sequence divergence. Simple Blast searches are not suited to identify such distantly related proteins and when performed with the protein sequence of effectors from ascomycete fungi, generally identify no or only very few conserved homologs in the same species. Therefore, more sensitive Psi-Blast searches that use position-specific scoring matrices were performed with AVR-Pia, AVR1-CO39, AvrPiz-t and ToxB. The searches were performed on a protein sequence database combining the protein sequences of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> reference isolate 70&#x2013;15, of 5 other rice-infecting <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolates (TH16, TH12, PH14, FR13 and Guy11), three <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolates with other host specificities (BR32, US71 and CD156 specific for wheat, <italic>Setaria italica</italic> and <italic>Eleusine coracana</italic>) and one isolate of the sister species <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> (BR29). These additional <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> protein sequences were obtained by whole genome re-sequencing and de novo annotation of proteins and are accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/gemo">http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/gemo</ext-link> [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). After 4 Psi-Blast iterations and filtering of the results for sequences having an alignment length of at least 40 residues, an overall protein size of less than 180 amino acids and the presence of a predicted signal peptide, 3, 8 and 4 homologs of AVR-Pia, 16, 25 and 16 homologs of AVR1-CO39 and 5, 9 and 6 homologs of ToxB were detected in respectively 70&#x2013;15, TH16 and BR29 (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>, orthologous sequences present in 70&#x2013;15 and TH16 were only counted for 70&#x2013;15). For the other <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolates similar numbers of homologs as in TH16 were found. The elevated number of homologs present in these isolates but not in 70&#x2013;15 are due to the fact that the pipeline used for protein annotation in the re-sequenced genomes identified many additional small secreted proteins that are not annotated in 70&#x2013;15 although the corresponding coding sequences are present in its genome [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). The similarities were weak (frequently less than 25% identity) but they were consistent with the structural alignment (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and included the two cysteine residues. For AvrPiz-t, no homologs that were not already identified by standard Blast were identified in the Psi-Blast search. When 25 additional fungal genomes, including the closely related fungi <italic>M</italic>. <italic>poae</italic> and <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic> were added to the database for the Psi-Blast searches, only very limited numbers of homologs (0, 1 or 2) with frequently low e-value scores were identified in other fungi.

        <title>HMM searches identify a huge MAX-effector family in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic></title>
        <p>To exclude that the Psi-Blast search missed MAX-effectors in the additional fungal genomes due to biases in the search matrix or too low sensitivity and to deepen the search for this class of effectors in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> genomes, a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based profile search was performed. This type of profile search is among the most powerful procedure for detecting with high accuracy remote homologies between proteins.</p>
        <p>As a first step, a high stringency Blast search with the three <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effectors and a Psi-Blast search with ToxB was performed and the resulting set of closely related sequences was aligned in a multiple sequence alignment constrained by the structural alignment of AVR-Pia, AVR1-CO39, AvrPiz-t and ToxB (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). For the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effectors, the Blast search identified orthologs of the effectors with few polymorphisms in different <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolates. In addition, for each <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effector, one paralog was identified in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and one or two paralogs were identified in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> isolate BR29 (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>). For the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> paralogs, generally several different alleles were identified. For ToxB, in addition to highly homologous sequences from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tritici-repentis</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>bromi</italic>, 1 homolog was identified in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, <italic>Bipolaris oryzae</italic> and <italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic>, 2 in C. <italic>fioriniae</italic>, 3 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>orbiculare</italic> and 4 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gloeosporioides</italic>. (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>As a second step, an HMM profile was built, starting from the structure-guided multiple sequence alignment from step1 (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>) and by iteratively searching for homologs in a database containing the small secreted proteins (&lt;170 amino acids) of 25 pathogenic and non-pathogenic ascomycete fungi and of the 9 re-sequenced <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> isolates from which completely redundant sequences had been removed. At each iteration, the recovered sequences were filtered for alignment of the two cysteins with a spacing of 34 to 49 amino acids and used to generate a new profile used in the next iteration. The interval of 34 to 49 amino acids was fixed, based on the frequencies of cystein spacings in HMM searches run without this constraint.</p>
        <p>This search recovered 161 new, more distantly related sequences of which 154 were from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic>, 5 from 3 different <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species, 1 from <italic>Lepthosphaeria maculans</italic> and 1 from <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic> (recently renamed <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>) (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). This suggests that MAX-effectors have been massively and specifically expanded in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic>. However, it also indicates their presence in other fungal species, i. e. in <italic>Colletrichum</italic> spp. where they seem to occur at elevated frequencies. The alignment and clustering of the set of 200 sequences combining the 39 sequences used for the initial profile and the 161 new sequences revealed clusters of orthologous sequences originating from the different <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolates with weak sequence polymorphism between orthologs (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). Frequently, orthologs of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> can be identified in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> but never in other fungi. Sequences from different orthologous clusters have high sequence diversity. Only in 3 cases, statistically significant clusters, supported by bootstrap values bigger than 50% can be identified that contain 2 distantly related MAX-effectors or MAX-effector clusters of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>.</p>

There is a propensity for hydrophobic residues in positions 4 and 6, corresponding to hydrophobic positions in strand &#x3B2;1, in position 27, corresponding to a hydrophobic residue in &#x3B2;3 and in positions 35, 37 and 39 corresponding to &#x3B2;4.

        <p>The resulting HMM profile was used to search with a relaxed cut-off two different databases: (i) the UniRef90 database that contains non-redundant sequences from a wide range of different organisms and that was used to determine in which type of organisms proteins with the MAX-effector motif occur and to evaluate by this the specificity of the motif and (ii) the previously described fungal genomes and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> database to get a precise view of the occurrence of MAX-effectors in a broad range of ascomycete fungi.</p>
        <p>The search of the UniRef90 database recovered 70 sequences. All but 3 were from phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Fig</xref>).

Among the fungal sequences, 49 were from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and included AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia. The remaining 18 corresponded to previously identified effectors from <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species (5 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>orbiculare</italic>, 2 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higgensianum</italic>, 3 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gloeosporioides</italic>, 2 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>fioriniae</italic>) that belong as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> to the class of Sordariomycetes and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>maculans</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> as well as ToxB from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tritici-repentis</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>bromi</italic> that are all from the class of Dothideomycete fungi. Clustering of the sequences revealed high sequence diversity and, apart from the Tox-B cluster, no or extremely limited relatedness could be identified (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).

AVR-Pik clearly fits the MAX-effector pattern but was discarded in the other searches since its secretion signal is not recognized by the SignalP4.1 program used for filtering of the results.</p>
        <p>The search of the previously described <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> and other fungal genomes database not filtered for redundancy recovered only limited numbers of MAX-effectors in non-<italic>Magnaporthe</italic> fungal genomes that had, with the exception of one effector from <italic>Fusarium fujicuroi</italic>, already been retrieved in the other searches (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005228.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A Fig</xref>). In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, between 67 and 38 MAX-effectors per isolate were identified while in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic>, 37 MAX-effectors were identified (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). 46 of the 55 MAX-effectors identified by Psi-Blast in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> 70&#x2013;15 and TH16 and in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> BR29 (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) were also found by this HMM search. Alignment and clustering shows that the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> MAX-effectors are generally present in the majority of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolates and are grouped in clusters of orthologs (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>). Many of these orthologous clusters also contain an ortholog from the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> isolate BR29 that shows however higher sequence divergence. Only six statistically significant clusters (bootstrap &gt; 50%) that contain more distantly related <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effectors from different orthologous groups are identified. Otherwise, the sequence diversity between proteins from different <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> ortholog clusters is so strong that classical tree building methods do not detect statistically significant sequence relatedness. The non-<italic>Magnaporthe</italic> MAX-effectors do not cluster significantly with <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> MAX-effectors and 8 of the 10 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> effectors are comprised in three different <italic>Colletotrichum</italic>-specific clusters.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the different HMM searches reveal that the MAX-effector motif is specific for effectors from phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi. MAX-effectors are identified with low frequencies in phytopthogenic ascomycete fungi from the class of Dothideomycetes and seem to have expanded moderately in different <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species (i.e. <italic>Colletotrichum orbiculare</italic>). Only in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic>, MAX-effectors expanded and diversified massively to become a dominating family of virulence effectors in these pathogens.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have determined by NMR spectroscopy the 3-dimensional structures of two different effectors of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia. Although the two proteins have no evident sequence similarity they possess similar 6 &#x3B2;-sandwich structures formed in both cases by two &#x3B2;-sheets each formed of three &#x3B2;-strands oriented in an antiparallel manner. Interestingly, similar &#x3B2;-sandwich structures have previously been found for AvrPiz-t, the only other structurally characterized <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effector and for ToxB, an effector from an only very distantly related plant pathogenic ascomycete fungus, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tritici-repentis</italic>. Overlay of the structures and structural alignments revealed that the nature and number of secondary structural elements and the topology of their fold are the same in all four effectors. In addition, all four proteins are stabilized by buried hydrophobic residues coming for their majority from the &#x3B2;-strands and by a disulfide bond between conserved cysteins located in the beginning of &#x3B2;1 and in the beginning or just before &#x3B2;5. However, the orientation and the length of certain &#x3B2;-strands, i.e. &#x3B2;-5, vary considerably and the sequences and the length of loops are highly variable resulting in proteins with very different shapes and surface properties. Due to the high sequence diversity, similarity among the MAX-effectors is therefore only detected when their structure is taken into consideration.</p>

        <title>Hydrophic surface patches in AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 are potential sites of protein-protein interaction</title>
        <p>The only similarity of the surfaces of AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia is an extended hydrophobic area on the surface formed by &#x3B2;1, &#x3B2;2 and &#x3B2;6. Such extended and exposed hydrophobic areas are uncommon since protein surfaces are generally in contact with solvent water molecules and they are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions. Previous studies on the recognition of AVR-Pia by the rice NLR immune receptor RGA5 support that the hydrophobic surface of AVR-Pia could indeed be involved in protein binding [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. AVR-Pia binds physically to a C-terminal domain of RGA5 homologous to heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain proteins related to the copper chaperone ATX1 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (RATX1 domain). This binding is required to derepress a second NLR RGA4 that activates resistance signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A natural allele of AVR-Pia (AVR-Pi-H3) where the surface exposed phenylalanine 24 and threonine 46 situated respectively in and at the border of the hydrophobic patch are replaced by serine and asparagine loses binding to RGA5<sub>RATX1</sub> and does not trigger resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Structural information will now guide further functional studies to elucidate if other amino acids situated in or at the border of the hydrophobic patch are also involved in RGA5<sub>RATX1</sub>-binding and to validate by this the role of the hydrophobic patch as a protein-protein interaction surface.</p>

        <title>MAX-effectors have different molecular properties and activities</title>
        <p>Common features of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> MAX-effectors are that they act intracellular in host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and are recognized by NLR immune receptors in resistant rice genotypes: AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia by the same NLR pair RGA4/RGA5 and AvrPiz-t by the NLR immune receptor Piz-t [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While the molecular bases of the recognition of AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia by RGA4/RGA5 are beginning to be elucidated, details of AvrPiz-t recognition are not known. Also, whether the three <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> MAX-effectors target similar host processes and host proteins is not known. AvrPiz-t was described to target the host ubiquitin proteasome system by binding and inactivating the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but virulence targets of AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 have not been described. However, it has been hypothesized that both proteins target RATX1 proteins homologous to the RGA5<sub>RATX1</sub> domain that was suggested to act as a mimic for AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 targets [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, we assume that AvrPiz-t on the one hand and AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 on the other have different molecular activities and target different host proteins. This would be in accordance with the high divergence of their shapes and their surface properties. That AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 interact with the same immune receptor by binding to the same sensor domain and potentially interact with the same host targets is striking because apart from the extended hydrophobic patch on the &#x3B2;1&#x3B2;2&#x3B2;6 surface they share no apparent similarities with respect to their shapes and surfaces. It will therefore be important to elucidate in the future which amino acids of AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 bind to RGA5<sub>RATX1</sub> and which surfaces of RGA5<sub>RATX1</sub> are involved in binding to each of the two effectors to better understand specificity in effector recognition. In addition, identification of AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia targets as well as ToxB targets for which molecular details of activity are also lacking will be important to understand how MAX-effectors promote virulence and to understand the link between MAX-effector structure and function.</p>

        <p>Structure-informed pattern searches identified huge numbers of MAX-effector candidates that possess as the structurally characterized MAX-effectors very high sequence diversity and probably also possess a 6 &#x3B2;-sandwich structure stabilized by buried hydrophobic residues from &#x3B2;-strands and a disulfide bond between conserved cysteins connecting &#x3B2;1 and &#x3B2;5. Systematic prediction of the secondary structure of the MAX effector candidates using SSPRO 5 software identified with high frequency two &#x3B2;-strands, &#x3B2;1 located after the first cysteine and &#x3B2;4 located before the second cysteine (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). The other regions of the sequences had more variable secondary structure predictions which is also reflected by a less defined pattern in these regions (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). High sequence diversity among MAX-effector candidates could as in the case of the structurally characterized MAX-effector be the consequence of interchangeability of buried hydrophobic core residues, variation in the lengths of some &#x3B2;-strands (i.e. &#x3B2;5), exchange of surface exposed residues and deletion or insertion of residues in exposed loops.</p>
        <p>MAX-effectors were specifically detected in phytopathogenic ascomycetes from the classes of Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes. One MAX-effector per species was detected in phytopathogenic fungi of the class of Dothideomycetes (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>maculans</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tritici-repentis</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>) and higher numbers (2&#x2013;6) occur in fungi from the genus <italic>Colletotrichum</italic>. Only in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> that are both from the genus <italic>Pyricularia</italic> huge numbers of MAX-effector candidates were detected and expression profiling confirmed that most of them are likely <italic>bona fide</italic> effectors expressed specifically during biotrophic early infection. With 40&#x2013;60 effectors which represents 5&#x2013;10% of the candidate effectors of individual <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> isolates, MAX-effectors can be considered a dominant class of effectors in these fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This is further supported by the finding that 5 of the 51 biotrophy-associated proteins identified by transcriptome analysis are MAX effectors (MG02546, MG08414, MG08482, MG09425 and MG09675) [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Also, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> effector AVR-Pik fits the MAX-effector pattern further highlighting the outstanding importance of this effector family that comprises 4 out of 8 cloned Avr effectors in the blast fungus [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is striking that the only other group of fungi with elevated numbers of MAX effectors are <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species. <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> fungi are phylogenetically only distantly related to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M grisea</italic> but employ a similar hemibiotrophic infection strategy characterized by appressorium-mediated penetration into the host and growth inside invaded plant cells during biotrophic infection. It will be interesting to determine in the future whether MAX effectors play similar roles in these early infection processes in both groups of fungi.</p>
        <p>In <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>poae</italic> that belong to the closely related <italic>Magnaporthaceae</italic> family no MAX-effectors were detected [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The expansion of MAX-effectors therefore occurred probably in a common ancestor of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> since clear orthologous relations can be established between many MAX-effectors from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> but after the split of the <italic>Magnaporthaceae</italic>. Expansion and diversification of the MAX-effectors is clearly continuing since frequently orthologs in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> cannot be identified and duplication, loss and diversification of MAX-effectors in host specific lineages of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> is observed (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8B Fig</xref>). Genome sequencing of additional species from <italic>Pyricularia</italic> and other genera in the <italic>Periculariae</italic> will allow to further strengthen the hypothesis of lineage-specific expansion of MAX-effectors.</p>
        <p>Lineage specific expansion of effector families has been observed in other fungi such as mildew and rust fungi whose effector repertoires are dominated by effector families that contain frequently numerous members and are for their majority restricted to individual species or precise clades [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, in these cases, sequence divergence is not as strong as in MAX-effectors since sequence-based comparisons allow the establishment to these effector families.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, the effector repertoires of ascomycete phytopathogens outside the mildew lineage contain hundreds of sequence-unrelated effectors and the evolutionary origin of these huge amounts of species or clade specific genes is an open question. Duplication and diversification eventually driven by localization of the genes in transposon rich regions, genome reshuffling or transfer of accessory chromosomes were convincingly proposed as potential mechanisms to create effector diversity but the apparent lack of relatedness of ascomycete effectors remains unexplained [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Establishment of a huge effector family in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>grisea</italic> that is also present at much lower frequency in other ascomycete pathogens sheds new light on the origin and relatedness of ascomycete effectors.</p>

        <title>Diversifying rather than convergent evolution leads to highly diversified effector families</title>
        <p>Theoretically, convergent evolution as well as diversifying evolution can explain the situation observed for the MAX-effectors characterized by a broad and patchy distribution, high diversification and limited sequence homology as well as a shared sequence pattern and probably the same structure. Convergent evolution would apply if these proteins with similar functions and a similar fold appeared repeatedly in phytopathogenic ascomycetes and eventually evolved independently in different clades. Under diversifying evolution, a protein or protein family present in a common ancestor has been strongly diversified in different lineages of ascomycete fungi and frequently lost during evolution in certain lineages and species. The scenario of convergent evolution of MAX-effectors cannot be excluded but is clearly less parsimonious. It raises the question why MAX-effectors do not occur in organisms with similar lifestyles outside the Sordariomycete and Dothideomycete pathogens such as phytopathogenic basidiomycetes or oomycetes. In addition, there are no well-documented examples of convergent evolution towards similar folds or sequence patterns for pathogenic effectors or secreted fungal proteins involved in adaption to the environment while comparative genomics studies in fungi and oomycetes are beginning to identify such widely distributed gene families that are shaped by strong diversifying selection and that can only be properly reconstructed when pattern-based searches and structure information are taken into consideration. The best documented example is certainly the WY-domain family among the RXLR effectors that is specific to the <italic>Peronosporales</italic> clade in oomycetes and evolves by diversifying evolution [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Careful sequence analysis involving pattern searches identified the W, Y and L sequence motifs in the effector domains of a majority of the <italic>Phytophtora</italic> RXLR effectors that are frequently completely sequence unrelated [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Functional analysis confirmed the importance of these motifs for effector function [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and structure analysis of the effector domain of different RXLR effectors with limited sequence homology revealed that conserved sequence motifs reflected a conserved, highly similar 3-dimensional structure named the WY-domain fold [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. PexRD2 and AVR3a11 show e.g. only 14% amino acid identity in a structure-based alignment but overlay of their structures has an RMSD score of 0.73 &#xC5;. As in the case of the &#x3B2;-sandwich fold of the MAX-effectors, the WY-domain fold tolerates insertion or deletion of amino acids in the loops, exchange of surface exposed amino acids and is stabilized by hydrophobic core residues that can be exchanged as long as hydrophobicity is maintained [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This flexible structure allows to generate effectors with highly variable shapes and surface properties and studied WY-domain effectors showed very diverse molecular activities, target different host proteins and are recognized by different NLR immune receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
        <p>An example of rapidly evolving proteins from fungi that are structurally but not sequence-conserved are hydrophobins that are low molecular mass secreted proteins important for the impermeabilization of fungal cell walls, adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces and pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Hydrophobins were shown to evolve rapidly according to a birth-and-death mechanism [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], are widely distributed in a broad range of basidio- and ascomycete fungi and are characterized by sequence patterns but no sequence homology [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Structure analysis demonstrated that distantly related hydrophobins are structurally related supporting a common evolutionary origin [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>
        <p>Another example of a fungal gene family that is rapidly evolving according to a birth-and-death model are the Hce2 proteins (<underline><bold>h</bold></underline>omologs of <underline><bold><italic>C</italic></bold></underline><italic>ladosporium fulvum</italic>

Much like MAX-effectors they show patchy distribution, lineage-specific expansions and high sequence diversification.</p>

        <title>MAX-effectors may serve as a paradigm for the evolution and diversification of effectors in phytopathogenic ascomycetes</title>
        <p>Based on our discovery of the MAX-effector family and the widely accepted concept that fungal effectors evolve according to a birth-and-death model we propose the hypothesis that the majority of the immense number of different ascomycete effectors could in fact belong to a restricted set of structurally defined families whose members are phylogenetically related. These families of structurally conserved effectors are expected to be, as the MAX-effectors widely distributed with frequent losses on the one hand and lineage specific expansions on the other leading to effector families that are particularly important in certain fungal clades but not in others. The evolution of individual effectors is so rapid and their adaptation to new functions so profound that sequence homology and resulting phylogenetic signals are rapidly lost although the basic protein architecture may frequently be conserved because it represents a good solution to many general constraints effectors have to face such as stability in the fungus-host interface or translocation into host cytosol. Sequence homology can therefore only be detected in orthologs from closely related species but in paralogs from the same species or homologs from more distantly related species no similarity is detected on the sequence level. Only structure-informed and pattern-based searches reveal the hidden relatedness of ascomycete effectors. This hypothesis is also supported by the recent identification of an effector super family in the powdery mildew fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> fsp <italic>hordei</italic> by structural modelling [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. 72 effectors from different families established by sequence homology or with no homology to other proteins had 3D structure models with similarity to ribonucleases suggesting a common origin and a conserved structure in this superfamily of sequence diverse effectors.</p>
        <p>Knowledge on the structures of fungal effector proteins is extremely limited and outside of the MAX-effectors the structures of only three cytoplasmic fungal effectors have been determined. AvrL567 from the rust fungus <italic>Melampsora lini</italic> and ToxA from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tritici-repentis</italic> have distantly related &#x3B2;-sandwich structures whose topologies are completely different from the MAX-effectors and AvrM has a helical structure [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Therefore, the elucidation of the 3-dimensional structures of additional fungal effectors is a priority for a better understanding of their diversity and will teach us to what extent structurally conserved but sequence-diversified effector families dominate the huge and extremely diverse effector repertoires of phytopathogenic fungi.</p>

Experiments were recorded using the TOPSPIN pulse sequence library (v. 2.1) (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). 2D-NOESY experiments with excitation sculpting water suppression were acquired at 305K, with mixing times from 100 to 150 msec. All spectra are referenced to the internal reference DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) for the <sup>1</sup>H dimension and indirectly referenced for the <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C dimensions [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p>
        <p>NMR data was processed using Topspin (v. 3.2) and were analyzed using strip-plots with Cindy in house software and CCPN [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] [analysis v 2.3]. Side chain assignments were carried out using 2D-NOESY, 2D-TOCSY and COSY-DQF experiments with D<sub>2</sub>O samples, combined with <sup>15</sup>N-NOESY-HSQC and <sup>15</sup>N-TOCSY-HSQC 3D spectra. For AVR-Pia, the two N-terminal residues Ala-Pro and the His-tag, Ser-His<sub>6</sub>-Ser were not assigned. For AVR1-CO39, the tag-residues Asp(-7)-Asn(-8) and the stretch Ser<sub>2</sub>-His<sub>6</sub>-Ser<sub>2</sub> were not assigned. The <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C assignments were derived from the 3D spectra at 500 MHz.</p>

        <title><sup>15</sup>N backbone amide NMR relaxation data</title>
        <p>Relaxation data were acquired at 305K on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer using R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} heteronuclear NOE pulse sequences (TOPSPIN library, v 2.1). NMR samples of 500 &#x3BC;L at 0.85 mM and 0.3 mM were used for AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, respectively. R<sub>1</sub> experiments were performed with nine relaxation delays (18, 54, 102, 198, 294, 390, 582, 774 and 966 ms). R<sub>2</sub> experiments were carried out employing a Carr&#x2013;Purcell&#x2013;Meiboom&#x2013;Gill (CPMG) pulse train [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] with eight relaxation delays (16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192 and 256 ms). A recycle delay of 2.5 s was employed in R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>, experiments, and <sup>15</sup>N decoupling during acquisition was performed using a GARP-4 sequence. In heteronuclear <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H}NOEs, proton saturation was achieved during the relaxation time by application of high-power 120&#xB0; pulse spaced at 20 ms intervals for 3 s prior to the first pulse on <sup>15</sup>N [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. A relaxation delay equal to 6 s between each scan was used.

The NH, H&#x3B1;, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C&#x3B1; and <sup>13</sup>C&#x3B2; chemical shifts were converted into &#x3A6;/&#x3A8; dihedral angle constraints using TALOS+ (v. 1.2) [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The CANDID procedure of CYANA (v 2.1) was used to assign the 3D-peaks list from the <sup>15</sup>N-NOESY-HSQC spectra. NOE assignments were inspected and used in a new CANDID assignment run including peaks from the 2D-NOESY spectra (with 100 and 150 msec mixing times for AVR-Pia and 100 and 200 msec for AVR1-CO39). A disulfide bridge Cys25-Cys66 for AVR-Pia and between Cys26-Cys61 for AVR1-CO39 was added based on cysteine C&#x3B2; chemical shifts and DTNB quantification of free thiols. NOE constraints were inspected and classified from very strong, strong, medium weak and very weak, corresponding to 2.4, 2.8, 3.6, 4.4 and 4.8 &#xC5; upper bound constraints, respectively. Final structure calculations were performed with CYANA (v. 2.1) using 1541 and 1286 distance restraints, for AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, with 90 and 72 &#x3A6;/&#x3A8; dihedral angle constraints, respectively. The 30 conformers with lowest target function starting from 200 initial structures, were refined by CNS (v. 1.2) using the refinement in water of RECOORD [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The final 20 conformers were selected with the lowest NOE and dihedral angle violations. These are the structures discussed herein and deposited (PDBs, 2MYV and 2MYW). The final 20 structures contained no NOE violations greater than 0.3 &#xC5; and no dihedral angle constraint violations greater than 2&#xB0;.

Sequences without signal peptide (according to SIGNALP 4.1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]) bigger than 170 amino acids or with less than 2 cysteine residues were removed. For the initial HMM search, identical sequences were reduced to only one occurrence in the databases.</p>
        <p>The start of the search was a structural alignment with TM-align [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] and the structures of AVR-Pia, AVR1-CO39, AvrPiz-t and ToxB complemented with sequence homologues found by single queries using BLAST (v 2.2.27+) with a stringent cut-off E-value = 1e-6. For the ToxB query, two iterations of NCBI PSI-BLAST were used on the NR database with a cut-off E-value = 1e-4 (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>This initial alignment was used as input to look for homologs in the filtered and non-redundant fungi database using HMMERsearch program from the HMMER package v 3.0 [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] with a 1e-6 E-value cut-off. For each run, only sequences where the two cysteine residues were aligned were kept, and the output alignment was used as input query for a new HMMERsearch run. This run was repeated until reaching convergence. New iterations were then done with increased E-value cut-off at 1e-5 and 1e-4. From the last alignment, a histogram indicated that the two aligned cysteine residues were separated by at least 34 and at most 49 amino acids.</p>
        <p>The full homolog search was re-started, as described above, but this time using also the aligned cysteine separations as an additional constraint for filtering homologs after each HMMERsearch run. The HMMERsearch runs were repeated until convergence for raised threshold E-values 1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4 and finally 1e-2. The homolog ensembles obtained for the three E-values cut-off, 1e-6, 1e-4 and 1e-2 were aligned with Muscle v3.8 [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1005228.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref> for E-value 1e-4). The derived logo was built from the HMMER search with E-value of 1e-4 using Weblogo3 [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) derived from the HMMER search with E-value 1e-4 was used as input to look for homologs in the redundant fungi database and the UniRef90 database, using HMMERsearch with an E-value threshold of 1e-1. Diversity trees were built from alignments generated with Muscle v3.8 using the Neighbor-Joining method with the MEGA6 package [<xref rid="ppat.1005228.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p>

          <p>mRNA levels of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genes coding for MAX-effectors (A, B and C) and marker genes (D) was determined by q-RT-PCR in rice leaf samples harvested 16, 24, 48 or 72 h after inoculation and mycelium grown liquid medium for 72 hours. (A) Infection specific MAX-effectors identified in the HMM search, (B) infection specific MAX-effectors identified in the Psi Blast search but nor in the HMM search, (C) constitutively expressed MAX-effectors identified in the HMM search and (D) marker genes for appressorium and very early infection (<italic>ORF3</italic> of the ACE1 cluster, <italic>MGG_0838</italic>1), biotrophic infection (<italic>BAS3</italic>, <italic>MGG_11610</italic>), late infection (<italic>MGG_01147</italic>), constitutive expression (<italic>EF1&#x3B1;</italic>, <italic>MGG_03641</italic>). Relative expression levels were calculated by using expression of a constitutively expressed <italic>Actin</italic> (<italic>MGG_03982</italic>) as a reference. Mean values and standard deviation were calculated from three independent biological samples.The analyzed genes, were in most cases not or extremely weakly expressed in the mycelium. For genes with significant expression in the mycelium (ratio gene versus actine &gt; 0,01) a T-test was performed to determine if in planta expression was significantly different from expression in the mycelium. In these cases (MGG_11967, MGG_14793, MGG_15207, MGG_17266, MGG_18019, M_TH16_00000541, M_TH16_00040131, M_TH16_00079081, M_TH16_00104561, M_TH16_00120731, M_TH16_00124981), a star or two stars (* or **) mark conditions where the expression was different from expression in the mycelium at respectively p&lt;0,05 or p&lt;0,005.</p>
