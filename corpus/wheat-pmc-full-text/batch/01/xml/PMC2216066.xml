        <p>In this study, we detail the construction of a custom cDNA spotted microarray containing 7728 wheat ESTs and the use of the array to identify host genes that are differentially expressed upon challenges with leaf rust fungal pathogens. Wheat cultivar RL6003 (Thatcher <italic>Lr1</italic>) was inoculated with <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic> virulence phenotypes BBB (incompatible) or TJB (7-2) (compatible) and sampled at four different time points (3, 6, 12, and 24 hours) after inoculation. Transcript expression levels relative to a mock treatment were measured. One hundred ninety two genes were found to have significantly altered expression between the compatible and incompatible reactions. Among those were genes involved in photosynthesis, the production of reactive oxygen species, ubiquitination, signal transduction, as well as in the shikimate/phenylpropanoid pathway. These data indicate that various metabolic pathways are affected, some of which might be used by RL6003 to mount a coordinated defense against an incompatible fungal pathogen.</p>

      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Leaf rust, caused by the
heteroecious basidiomycete <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic> Eriks, is one of the most
important diseases of wheat worldwide. Serious yield losses can result as a consequence of its broad
distribution and potential to develop rapidly under optimal environmental
conditions. Furthermore, the ability of <italic>P.
triticina</italic> to form new races that can attack previously resistant cultivars,
along with the capacity of fungal spores to travel long distances, can make
full control of leaf rust difficult. Due
to its importance, epidemiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], genetic 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and molecular aspects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] of the 
disease have been studied extensively. As a consequence, the
wheat-<italic>P. triticina</italic> interaction is
well defined in genetic terms and stages of infection 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Scanning electron 
microscopy work by Hu and Rijkenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] identified 
important time points in infection structure
formation by <italic>P. triticinia</italic> on
susceptible and resistant lines of hexaploid wheat.
 Six hours after infection, the fungus forms appressoria
over stomata openings. After12&#x2009;hours, the fungus has successfully
penetrated into the stoma, formed substomatal vesicles (SSV), and primary
infection hyphae are visible. 
After SSV formation, the primary infection hypha grows and attaches to a mesophyll or
epidermal cell. At 24 hours
postinoculation (HPI), a septum appears separating the haustorial mother cell
from the infection hypha after which the fungus forms haustorium and penetrates
the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Much remains unknown regarding the molecular basis of disease development. Nevertheless,
numerous genes involved in the wheat-pathogen response have been
identified. These include genes encoding
leaf rust resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], antifungal hydrolases such as 
glucanase and chitinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], protein 
kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and enzymes involved in the production of
reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Of 
the leaf rust resistance genes, <italic>Lr1</italic> is described as one of those conferring 
resistance to leaf rust low pathogenic races in wheat seedlings 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Until recently,
however, molecular studies of the host response to pathogen attack were
restricted to the analysis of a relatively small number of genes or
proteins. This has changed with the development of high-throughput technologies, such as cDNA 
and oligonucleotide microarrays that allow expression profiling of thousands of genes
simultaneously. Thus, microarrays
represent important tools for the global analysis of many plant processes,
including the response to pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There are already a number of studies that
have used cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize plant-pathogen
interactions. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cDNA microarray analysis demonstrated a substantial
network of regulatory coordination among different defence signaling pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In another study, microarray
analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcriptome during systemic acquired 
resistance revealed groups of genes with common regulation patterns 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Microarrays have also been used to investigate 
plant defence in nonmodel organisms. For instance, oligonucleotide
arrays were used to analyze maize challenged with the pathogen <italic>Cochliobolus 
carbonum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], barley
challenged by <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>hordei</italic> 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and <italic>Fusarium</italic> 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to 
identify genes that showed expression changes during the interactions. In wheat lines carrying 
the leaf rust resistance gene <italic>Lr1,</italic> however, little is known
regarding the expression of genes during differential responses following
inoculation with compatible and incompatible races of the pathogenic leaf rust
fungus <italic>P. triticina</italic>. In this report, we describe the development
and use of a wheat cDNA microarray to examine changes in gene expression in the
wheat line RL6003 in response to challenge by compatible and incompatible races
of <italic>P. triticina</italic>.</p>

        <p>Wheat near isogenic line RL6003 (Thatcher *6/Centenario), carrying the <italic>Lr1</italic> leaf rust 
resistance gene, was used throughout the study because Thatcher is known to strongly 
express the introgressed <italic>Lr</italic> genes. Seeds were sown in 12&#x2009;cm 
diameter plastic pots filled with a 3 : 1 soil/Sunshine Professional Growing Mix 5 soil mixture
(Sun Gro Horticulture, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), at a rate of one
seed per pot. Seedlings were maintained
in a growth room at 20&#xB0;C with a 16-hour photoperiod and a photon flux density
of approximately 145&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>. They were watered and fertilized as
required. Plants were inoculated at the
2-3 leaf stage with urediniospores of <italic>P. triticina</italic> virulence phenotypes
BBB (incompatible) or TJB (7-2) (compatible) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] mixed with a 
light mineral oil (Bayol-Esso Canada, Oak Bluff, Manitoba, Canada). 
Twenty five <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>l of a 16.6&#x2009;mg 
uredinispores/ml
of mineral oil inoculum were applied to each pot. Seedlings were sprayed until runoff with the
spore suspensions using a deVilbis-type sprayer, connected to an air line and
operated at a pressure of 17&#x2009;KPa.
Control plants were sprayed only with mineral oil, referred to as mock
inoculation. The inoculated plants were
allowed to dry for at least 30 minutes to let the oil volatilize and then
incubated overnight in a 100% humid chamber (Percival model I-60D) 
(Percival Scientific, Perry, Iowa, USA). They were subsequently transferred to a
growth chamber and kept under the conditions described above.

Leaf tissues were sampled 3, 6, 12, and 24 HPI. Plants were rated for symptom development 12
days after inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Three
independent biological replicates were performed.</p>

race
BBB or developing seeds of &#x201C;Glenlea&#x201D; sampled at 5, 15, or 25 days
postanthesis. Plasmid DNA, pBK-CMV
(Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif, USA), and pSport 6.0 (Invitrogen, Burlington,
Ontario, Canada), respectively, for the leaf and seed libraries, were isolated
using the Perfect Prep Direct Bind Kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), adapted
for the Qiagen 3000 Liquid Handling Robot (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). 
EST sequencing was performed with M13F and
M13R universal primers using the Big Dye V2.0 (ABI, Foster City, Calif, USA)
and resolved on an ABI 377 Genetic Analyzer.
High-quality sequence was obtained using the softwares phred and
cross_match (default settings except for minscore = 20 and minmatch = 12)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A total of 24&#x2009;959 ESTs were
obtained from the libraries and were submitted to GenBank (accessions
BE417910-BE418911, BG903972-BG910140, BQ619578-BQ620868, BQ235898-BQ252370, ES316459). The
sequences were assembled using CAP3 software (default parameters except overlap
length cutoff = 40 and overlap identity cutoff = 95) 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and in 
combination with some manual annotations, a unigene set of approximately 
12&#x2009;500 sequences was identified. Plasmids of the unigene set
members were used as template for PCR amplification of the inserts using
universal M13 primers. Amplicons were
visualized on agarose gels and selected for use on the microarray based on
their quality and uniqueness. A subset
of 7728 selected amplicons was consolidated to 384-well plates and purified
using Multiscreen 384 PCR filtration plates (Millipore, Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Aliquots of the purified products were run on
1% (w/v) agarose gels, sized and quantified using known amounts of 
lambda <italic>Hind</italic> III markers. They were then diluted in 
1 &#xD7; microspotting 
plus solution (TeleChem, Sunnyvale, Calif, USA)
to a final concentration of 100&#x2009;ng/<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>L. 
A total of 384 controls provided with the SpotReport-3 (Stratagene) kit,
consisting of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CAB, rbcL

RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, Wis, USA). The reaction mixture was heated 
at 65&#xB0;C for 5 minutes and then cooled
to 42&#xB0;C. Four hundred units of
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) were added, and the labeling
reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours at 42&#xB0;C. The RNA was then degraded by treatment with 5&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>L of 50 mM EDTA (pH 8)

acid, the mock and TJB (MT) or mock and BBB (MB) samples were pooled, and the
cDNA was precipitated by the addition of one volume of isopropanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air
dried, resuspended in 5&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>L of nuclease-free water, and added to 60&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>L of

as &#x201C;bad,&#x201D; &#x201C;not found,&#x201D; or with specific unwanted feature 
parameters were removed automatically by imposing stringent filtering criteria 
to the entire microarray dataset (acuity criteria dia &#x2265;60 and circularity 
&#x2265;80). Lowess normalization was applied to the
data. The log<sub>2</sub> median (logM)
ratio of expression values for genes, incompatible versus mock (MB) and
compatible versus mock (MT), that met the filtration criteria and were found in
both treatment sets, was subjected to further statistical 
analysis. An analysis of variance using the SAS procedure Mixed (SAS, Cary, NC, USA)
was carried out on the (logM )ratio data for incompatible (MB) and compatible
(MT) interactions, and contrasts were used to identify genes with significant
differences in expression at one or more time points as defined by their <italic>P</italic>

type (MB or MT), time, and the interaction between compatibility type and
time. Main plots were replicate by
interaction type (representing MB or MT pairs of batches of inoculum) in a
randomized complete block arrangement, and subplots were individual

        <p>To unravel global changes in the
host transcriptome during leaf rust interactions, wheat RL6003, which carries
the <italic>Lr1</italic> resistance gene, was challenged with two different
races of the leaf rust fungus, <italic>Puccinia

carries the avirulence gene <italic>Avr Lr1</italic> and provokes an incompatible reaction on RL6003, while race TJB lacks the
avirulence gene and therefore produces a compatible interaction. A sharply contrasting phenotype was observed
between the two interactions.  The TJB
interaction displayed a compatible &#x201C;3+ 4-&#x201D; infection type 
characterized by large pustules and
abundant sporulation while interaction with BBB yielded an incompatible &#x201C;;1-&#x201D; infection type
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The presence of small
pustules or no sporulation was typical of a hypersensitive response (HR). No symptoms were observed on mock-inoculated
seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>3.2. Gene expression profiling</title>
        <p>To identify genes whose expression profile can distinguish compatible from incompatible
interactions, we designed an experiment using the pathosystem outlined in the
previous section: one host genotype, RL6003, inoculated with the two rust
races, BBB and TJB, each compared to a mock control sample. Infection ensued and samples were 
taken at four time points: 3, 6, 12, and 24 HPI. The whole experiment was 
repeated three times to generate three biological replicates. Sequences on the
microarray were taken from an assembly of approximately 12&#x2009;500 unigenes
generated from an EST set of 24&#x2009;959 sequences. Parameters to the assembly program, CAP3, were the same as those used by TIGR for its unigene assemblies 
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.tigr.org">www.tigr.org</ext-link>). These parameters favoured assembly of homoeologous genes into single
sequences without the inclusion of paralogous genes. A total of 5728 microarray &#x201C;spots&#x201D; met the
filtration criteria outlined in the materials and methods, 4439 of which were
shared between the MB and MT datasets and were used for statistical
analysis. Statistical analysis of the
microarray data using SAS and confirmation of the identity of ESTs by
sequencing revealed 192 genes that were significantly differentially regulated
across at least one of the four times points between the compatible and
incompatible interactions (<italic>P</italic> &#x2264;.055 for the pathogen type by time

as determined using tests (<italic>P</italic> &#x2264; .05), at a single time point, 18%
of genes showed differential expression at 2 time points, and 1% at 3 time
points, while no genes in this set were differentially expressed at all four of
the time points investigated. At 6 HPI, 46% of the genes were differentially
expressed, followed by 40% at 24 HPI. The 3- and 12-hour time points showed much less differential gene

        <p>Using BLAST analysis, we were able
to assign, with various degrees of confidence, a potential function to 150 of
the differentially regulated genes.
Forty two gene sequences did not share sequence homology to any
sequences in the GenBank nonredundant protein database at our threshold <italic>E</italic> value (1 &#xD7; 10 &#x2212; 5), and therefore, no annotation could be assigned. Gene ontology (GO) annotation was performed using the TAIR annotation
tool and the genes were placed into GOSlim categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Molecular function assignment revealed
members in a broad range of categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) including those genes with putative hydrolase activity, nucleotide binding activity, and protein binding
activity. The differentially regulated
genes were also members of a variety of cellular components with a large
representation from the chloroplast and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The biological process GO assignment
illustrated that genes involved in protein metabolism, electron transport or
energy pathways, and response to abiotic/biotic stimuli were well represented
in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>).</p>

the sequence (TaLr1013E06R) was a gene from a conserved pathway and had
stronger homology to a rice gene than to the fungal sequence.</p>

        <title>3.4. Genes involved in photosynthesis</title>
        <p>A number of genes involved in the
energy status of the cell were differentially regulated. For example, the interaction between 
RL6003
and an incompatible or compatible rust race produced a differential expression
pattern for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small
subunit (TaLr1140F12A, TaLr1150F09F). Rubisco is the main source of energy production
for the plant cell, generating ATP and reductive potential (NADPH) through
photosynthesis. In the incompatible
interaction, the expression of the gene was reduced at 6 HPI but returned to
levels identical to the mock 
inoculation at 12 and 24 HPI. The compatible interaction, however, was
characterized by a strong increase in the transcription of the Rubisco small
subunit at 24 HPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Along with differential expression of Rubisco, there was a change in the transcription of
its major regulatory protein, Rubisco activase (TaLr1173G10F, TaLr1175G08F)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At 3 HPI, there was a small
reduction in the transcription of Rubisco activase relative to basal levels for
both the compatible and incompatible interactions. At 6 HPI the plants involved in an
incompatible interaction continued to repress the expression of Rubisco
activase, while in the compatible interaction, expression of the transcript
returned to near basal levels. Other genes in the photosynthetic apparatus were differentially expressed as
well. Chlorophyll A/B-binding protein
genes (TaLr1131B12A, TaLr1142E01A, and TaLr1167E07A), an FtsH like
AAA-metalloprotease (TaLr1134F10F), and a photosystem II phosphoprotein
(TaLr1130A12A) were down regulated at 6 HPI in the incompatible interaction
relative to basal and compatible interaction levels. In both treatments, the expression of these
genes was at basal levels for the other time points. An important enzyme involved in
photorespiration, glycolate oxidase (TaLr1162D03A), was also found to be
differentially regulated. Its expression
was repressed at 3 and 6 HPI in plants involved in an incompatible interaction
but not in a compatible one.</p>

        <title>3.5. Genes involved in redox control</title>
        <p>The
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is central to the defence mounted
by plants in reaction to challenge with an incompatible pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Shortly after challenge, the plant produces
an &#x201C;oxidative burst&#x201D; which is believed to have three roles: (i) induces
damage on the invading organism, (ii) bolsters structural defences, and (iii)
acts as a biochemical signal to induce other defence mechanisms in the
plant. The production of ROS presents a
challenge to a plant because of the damage these compounds can cause to its own
proteins, DNA, and other cellular components. The plant must therefore invoke a balanced system that produces ROS for
defence at the same time as a number of antioxidants to protect against
oxidative damage. Ascorbate peroxidase
(APX: TaE25014D09F), a central component of the ROS scavenging system, was
differentially expressed in the compatible and incompatible interactions. At 6 HPI, transcription of APX in plants
challenged by the incompatible race was significantly upregulated relative to
transcription in those challenged by the compatible race 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Another critical protein for maintaining redox balance in the face of oxidative stress is
glutathione, which acts as ubiquitous supplier of reduction power for cellular
processes. Glutathione is a conjugate of
cysteine and glutamate and therefore relies on both of these amino acids for
synthesis. Cysteine synthase
(TaE25012D06R) is the final catabolic step in the production of cysteine and
was found to be differentially regulated between the two treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Plants in an incompatible
interaction increased the transcription of this gene at 6 HPI, while those in a
compatible interaction reduced it. At
the 12-hour time point, the incompatible plants had reduced transcription of
the gene relative to basal levels while the compatible plants had upregulated
transcription.</p>

        <p>Recognition of <italic>P. triticina</italic> infection by RL6003 occurs through a gene-for-gene
system where resistance only occurs if the plant possesses an R-gene encoding a

(Avr-gene) produced by the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. If either of these components is missing, the plant is unable to mount
an effective defence against the invader. R-genes identified to date fall into five different categories and
commonly contain a leucine-rich repeat region (LRR), a domain known to be
involved in protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A significant portion of the microarray cDNA content used in this study was
derived from a library of RL6003 (Thatcher <italic>Lr1</italic> )
leaf tissue collected 24 HPI with an incompatible <italic>P. triticina</italic> race. Although
we have recently confirmed (by cloning of <italic>Lr1</italic> in a separate study) that <italic>Lr1</italic> was not
present on the array (unpublished data), three of the differentially regulated
genes identified in our experiment nevertheless contained LRR domains, two of
which are of the NBS-LRR class of R-genes (TaE05012C12F, TaLr1134C01R). There did not appear to be a coordinated
pattern of expression among these three genes at the time points tested
(Supplementary Table 1).</p>
        <p>Recently, a cyclophilin was found to be necessary for host-pathogen recognition in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A cyclophilin-like protein (TaE25043B07R)
was differentially regulated in our experiment and it shared an expression
profile very much like that of one of the identified NBS-LRR genes
(TaE05012C12F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Two other disease-associated genes were also identified, an <italic>Mlo4</italic>-like gene (TaLr1140F02A) and a multidrug resistant-associated
protein 1-(<italic>MRP1-</italic>) like gene
(TaLr1143B08F). These two genes showed similar expression profiles in the incompatible interaction. They were generally repressed in this
treatment, with the strongest repression at 6 HPI. In the compatible interaction, initial
repression of these genes occurred at 3 and 12 HPI, but returned to near-basal
levels at the other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

      <p>To gain
insight into the transcriptional changes that occur in incompatible and

experiment. In this study, we used an
ANOVA to identify 192 wheat genes that showed differential expression profiles
resulting from two different pathogen challenges. Our results revealed a
clear differentiation between incompatible and compatible interactions and led
to the identification of differentially regulated genes putatively involved in
defence reactions.</p>
      <p>We examined four
time points early in the infection stages of virulent and avirulent races of <italic>P. triticinia</italic> on the wheat line
RL6003. At 6 and 24 HPI, 46% and 40% of
the differentially expressed genes, respectively, were found to have different
degrees of change between the two pathogen treatments. In contrast, only 11% and 10% of genes were
differentially expressed at 3 and 12 HPI. Upon inoculation, <italic>P. triticinia</italic> urediospores germinate within hours on the wheat leaf surface, form a germ
tube, and grow until a stomatal guard cell is reached. At this point, the fungus forms an appressorium
over the stoma, enters by force into the substomatal space, and creates a
substomatal vesicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The fungal
growth into the intercellular space occurs at 6 HPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and coincides with the
highest differential gene expression in our study. At 24&#x2009;hours, when 40% of the identified genes
reveal changes in expression, the fungus has already produced a septum which
separates the primary infection hypha from the newly formed haustorial mother
cell which initiates contact with adjacent mesophyll or epidermal cells as
shown by Hu and Rijkenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Those
authors have studied the infection process of <italic>P. triticinia</italic> on susceptible (Thatcher) and resistant wheat lines
(RL6040 which contains the <italic>Lr19</italic> leaf
rust resistance gene and RL6043 which contains the <italic>Lr21</italic> leaf rust resistance gene) of wheat and no significant
differences were observed between the three lines during these early infection
events. Moreover, very similar results
were obtained during <italic>P. triticinia</italic> infection of nonhost species such as maize, oat, sorghum, and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Based on these studies, it is likely that the
growth of the two races of <italic>P. triticinia</italic> used on RL6003 in this study invoke very similar responses during the early
infection stages as that of the <italic>P.
triticinia</italic> races used by Hu and Rijkenberg on other resistant wheat lines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. If this is the case, RL6003 was
responding to the leaf rust pathogen before any cellular penetration had
occurred. This suggests that the plant
is able to perceive fungal movements on the leaf surface and past the guard
cells, possibly through cell membrane rearrangements or cell wall degradation
products caused by compounds excreted by the fungus. Our early stage data for differential
expression of host genes contrast the findings of Caldo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] where no
differences in expression among barley genes were observed up to 16 HPI after
treatment with <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f.

expression only during the stages involving haustoria-plant epidermal membrane
contact. However, differential plant
gene expression has been detected in other plant systems during the initial

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This study is therefore the first to show such early differential gene
expressions in wheat using the pathogen <italic>P.
triticinia</italic>.</p>
      <p>Resistance of wheat genotypes to leaf rust pathogens can often be attributed to a
gene-for-gene interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In
general, its visible defence response, the hypersensitive response (HR),
reflects a multitude of metabolic changes in affected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and
results in localized plant cell death. RL6003 challenged with an incompatible race of <italic>P. triticinia</italic> exhibits an HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and it is believed to be
mediated through pathogen elicitor detection by <italic>Lr1</italic>. One of the hallmarks of
the HR disease response is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
an oxidative burst across the plasmalemma of plants cells, perturbing the redox
state of cells and allowing controlled oxidation, which may have an immediate
antimicrobial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In
<italic>Asparagus sprengeri</italic> mesophyll, HR
induction by a G-protein activator, mastoparan (MP), resulted in significant
changes in photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The
authors demonstrated that during the elicitor-induced HR and oxidative burst,
light was stimulating the HR, that O<sub>2</sub> evolution ceased due to a
disruption of photosystem II (PSII) and electron transport and that
photosynthesis was eventually inhibited by MP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Recent work to identify ESTs involved in a
rice-rice blast fungus interaction found that transcription of photosynthetic
genes, such as ribulose 1,5-bisphosphatase carboxylase (Rubisco), photosystem
I-(PSI-) associated genes, PSII-associated genes, and chlorophyll A/B-binding
protein (CAB) genes, were suppressed in both resistant and susceptible
interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In soybean, it has
been shown that in addition to known defence regulated genes, challenge with <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> induced a rapid
downregulation of photosynthesis and that this effect was HR specific
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In their study, Zou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]
found that chloroplast-related genes had reduced expression 8 hours after
challenge and found a decrease in PSII activity and an interruption in the
photosynthetic electron transport chain. It is speculated that the over-reduction of PSII components and an
interruption of electron transport result in electron leakage and the formation
of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our data also
identified photosynthesis-related genes that were downregulated during pathogen
challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Six hours after inoculation,
we observed a coordinated decrease in transcription of these genes in the
resistant but not susceptible interactions. If this decrease in photosynthetic gene expression is linked or due to
the HR as observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], one may reasonably ask
&#x201C;what would be the purpose&#x201D;? Six hours
into the infection, the fungus has just entered the substomatal space and has
yet to directly invade a mesophyll or epidermal cell. If the decrease in photosynthesis is used to
generate ROS for an oxidative burst, then this burst does not likely have any
antimicrobial activity since <italic>P.
triticinia</italic> growth is identical in the first 24 hours of infection in
susceptible and resistance reactions with wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One of the key enzymes involved in removing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
APX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], was identified as being differentially expressed in our study. Although APX has been shown to be
translationally inhibited during programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], based on its
expression profile in this study, we speculate that the cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration increased 6 hours after challenge with an incompatible race of <italic>P. triticinia</italic> and that APX levels were
likely increased in an attempt by the cell to curtail oxidative damage. If ROS are generated at this stage, it is
more likely that they act on nonhost defence responses and have a role in
cellular fortification, intercellular signaling, or act to change the redox
state of the cell for regulatory purposes. Additional experiments to measure ROS generation during the wheat-rust
interaction would be needed to determine if an oxidative burst is occurring at
6 HPI.</p>
      <p>The interruption
in the electron transport chain in the chloroplast during the HR is believed to
be mediated by a Zn-dependent AAA-metalloprotease called FtsH. During stress, a component of PSII, D1, can
become damaged and has to be replaced by a newly synthesized D1 protein in
order to restore PSII function. FtsH
degrades damaged D1, allowing for a functional version of the protein to take
its place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. We identified a wheat
AAA-metalloprotease FtsH-like gene (TaLr113410F) with reduced expression in the
incompatible reactions at 3 and 6 HPI. This may indicate that PSII is affected during <italic>P. triticinia</italic> pathogenesis. Similar results were reported by Seo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] in tobacco where the
expression of a chloroplast FtsH protein was reduced and electron transport
interrupted 6 hours following the induction of an HR by tobacco mosaic
virus. Those authors believed that the
disruption of photosynthesis perturbed cellular homeostasis (possibly by
consuming reductive power) which accelerated the HR. They suggested that it was also possible that
reducing photosynthesis reduced sugar production, limiting the food source for
the invading pathogen. It seems likely
that the downregulation of photosynthesis and the interruption of the electron
transport chain may be conserved features of the defence response to pathogen
challenges as it is shared by rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and we
observed evidence of this mechanism in wheat.</p>
      <p>Plant responses to
biotic stress involve multiple interlinked regulatory pathways that transduce
suitable signals for efficient defence reactions 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In addition to the ROS pathway described
earlier, our microarray profiling detected a number of genes in the shikimate
and phenylpropanoid pathways that were differentially regulated. The shikimate pathway leads to the
biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid, phytoalexins (terpenoids, flavonoids), lignin,
and salicylate which are main secondary metabolites of the disease resistance
machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>&#x2013;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Our analysis identified that
3-deoxy-D-arabino heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, the entry point into the
shikimate pathway, was differentially regulated between the two pathogen treatments. At 6 HPI, transcription was found to be
increased in the incompatible interaction but the greatest difference occurred
at 24 HPI when the expression was increased in the compatible interaction and
downregulated in the incompatible interaction. Other components downstream in the shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway
were also differentially regulated, such as 3-beta hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase-isomerase, which is involved in metabolism of alkaloids,
caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, which is involved in lignin biosynthesis and
cell wall fortification, and farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthetase, which is
involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid compounds. All of the genes identified in the
shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway had their strongest expression in plants
challenged with a compatible pathogen. This may illustrate an important distinction in the <italic>Lr1</italic> pathosystem in which the plants involved in an incompatible
interaction dedicate cellular resources to redox systems, as evidenced by early
expression of ROS enzymes and downregulating photosynthetic genes, while plants
in a compatible interaction trigger nonspecific defence responses, such as
cellular fortification and alterations in their secondary metabolism.</p>
      <p>In our data, we
identified three genes that contain LRR domains, regions involved in
protein-protein interactions, and two of the three were of the NBS-LRR class,
with homology to putative R-genes, although neither of them encodes the <italic>Lr1</italic> gene (unpublished data). One of the NBS-LRR genes (TaE05012C12F)
shares homology with the rice protein <italic>Xa1</italic>, which confers bacterial
blight resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Interestingly,
Yoshimura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] showed that <italic>Xa1</italic> expression was induced by wounding and pathogen attack, which prompted the authors to speculate that  <italic>Xa1</italic> 
may be involved in enhancing the disease response to bacterial blight. Although it is not responsible for AVR <italic>Lr1</italic> recognition, this <italic>Xa1</italic>-like NBS-LRR gene may be activated to serve a similar purpose, which is the enhancement of the defence response; it is possible that other, yet undescribed, fungal factors present in race BBB interact with this resistance-like gene. Plants in the incompatible interaction showed
a spike of induction of this gene at 6 HPI, which coincided with the expression of other defence systems genes. It was
also recently found that a cyclophilin protein plays a role in an R-gene signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The bacterial effector, AVRRPT2 from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae, </italic> relies on an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cyclophilin
to initiate its protease activity. Once activated, AVRRPT2 cleaves RIN4, which is then recognized by the NBS-LRR
protein RPS2 and triggers an incompatible response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In our study, a wheat cyclophilin had a
nearly identical expression pattern to that of the <italic>Xa1</italic>-like gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and may indicate that they operate in the same pathway and that this method of avr-gene activation described in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> exists in wheat.</p>
      <p>The recognition of
invading pathogens activates a signal cascade that leads to a change in gene
expression. A number of important components
in the transduction of stress and disease signals have been identified. These include several mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinases, MAP kinase kinases, and transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Our data revealed coordinated expression
among components involved in MAP pathway signaling, transcription factors, and
genes that have been found to be expressed during a disease response. Their coordinated expression may indicate
that these genes operate in the same signal transduction pathway.</p>
      <p>Plant defence
response to pathogen attack can also include the modification of proteins by
ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Many members of the
ubiquitination cascade were found differentially regulated in our experiment,
including ubiquitin activating enzymes, ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and
components of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. Despite the lack of a unified expression profile among the members of
the pathway, it is clear that the process of protein modification by ubiquitin
plays a role in the disease response of wheat to races of <italic>P. triticinia</italic>.</p>
      <p>There were a
number of genes identified in this study that have protein products regulated
by changes in the redox state of the cell: APX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], glycolate oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>],
Rubisco activase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], Rubisco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], plastid glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], and 3-deoxy-D arabino
heptosonate-7 phosphate synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. It is likely that, in addition to regulating protein activity, the
reductive power of the cell plays an important role in regulating the
transcription of these genes, possibly through a feedback mechanism involving
an interruption in the photosynthetic apparatus. We also observed that a number of genes were
differentially expressed from basal levels in both treatments but at different
time points. In the incompatible response,
these genes were differentially regulated relative to basal level at 6 HPI
while in the compatible response the transcriptional differences occurred at 12
HPI. The reason for this difference is
unknown but it is tempting to speculate that the coordinated expression of
pathways at 6 HPI rather than simply the induction or suppression of defence
pathways at early stages of infection might determine the outcome of the
pathogenic interaction. A microarray
experiment examining gene expression differences between compatible and
incompatible interactions of <italic>P. syringae</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> found that the
expression of genes in the early hours of the incompatible infection resembled
the expression of the same genes at much later stages in the compatible interaction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. They stated that this may indicate
that incompatible and compatible interactions share signaling pathways but are
induced at different times. To determine
if this is the case between wheat and leaf rust as well, additional expression
profiling experiments over a broader time span would need to be performed.</p>
      <p>It is not known
that the gene expression changes that were measured at the early stages of
infection lead to the induction of HR. It could be that the induction did not occur until later in the
infection process. The possibility exists that this study did not measure
Thatcher <italic>Lr1</italic> undergoing compatible
and incompatible reactions due to the presence or absence of the <italic>avr Lr1</italic> gene, but instead measured
differential expression due to other genetic difference that exists between
fungal races BBB and TJB. However, given
that many of the genes identified in this study are differentially expressed
during the HR and gene-for-gene recognition responses in other systems, it is
likely that the start of the incompatible and compatible reactions due
 to <italic>avr Lr1 Lr1</italic> was being observed.</p>
      <p>Taken together, this study allowed us to show that phenotypic differences between the
incompatible and compatible interactions in the wheat near-isogenic line
RL6003/<italic>P. triticinia</italic> pathosystem are
also reflected by differential expression of mRNA transcripts that occur very
early after infection. Enzymes involved
in photosynthesis and in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, signal
transduction and ubiquitination, as well as those of the
shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway, are strongly implicated as key determinants
in RL6003 metabolism against incompatible pathogenic fungi. These findings indicate that synergistic and
conserved strategies are utilized by the incompatible wheat host to fight
against <italic>P. triticina</italic>.</p>

differentially expressed sequences and all of the sequences on the microarray against
the set of predicted <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> proteins was used to assign gene ontology.
The first hit with an <italic>E</italic> value
less than or equal to 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> was used as a functional assignment
and the TAIR GO annotation tool was used to bin the genes into the ontology
groupings: (a) molecular function of the differentially expressed genes; (b) molecular
function of the genes on the microarray; (c) cellular location of differentially expressed genes; (d)
cellular location of genes on the microarray; (e) biological process for
differentially expressed genes on the microarray; (f) biological process for the
genes on the microarray.</p>

        <p>Expression profile of several genes involved in photosynthesis. Panel (a) incompatible, panel (b) compatible
interaction. Genes involved in
photosynthesis share a similar expression profile between the two
treatments. At 6 HPI, the incompatible
interaction shows a general reduction in the expression of some photosynthetic
genes. The <italic>y</italic>-axis is the logM
value, the log<sub>2</sub> median ratio of expression values for genes
from incompatible versus mock inoculations (MB) or for genes from compatible
versus mock inoculations (MT). Error bars are the standard error
for the expression of that gene in our mixed linear model as determined by the
SAS procedure Mixed.</p>
