      <abstract>
        <p>Plant male sterility has often been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the mechanism in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) has not been elucidated. This study set out to probe the mechanism of physiological male sterility (PHYMS) induced by the chemical hybridizing agent (CHA)-SQ-1, and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) of wheat at the proteomic level. A total of 71 differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins were found to be involved in pollen abortion and further identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of fight/time of flight mass spectrometry). These proteins were implicated in different cellular responses and metabolic processes, with obvious functional tendencies toward the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the mitochondrial electron transport chain, protein synthesis and degradation, oxidation stress, the cell division cycle, and epigenetics. Interactions between identified proteins were demonstrated by bioinformatics analysis, enabling a more complete insight into biological pathways involved in anther abortion and pollen defects. Accordingly, a mitochondria-mediated male sterility protein network in wheat is proposed; this network was further confirmed by physiological data, RT-PCR (real-time PCR), and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling) assay. The results provide intriguing insights into the metabolic pathway of anther abortion induced by CHA-SQ-1 and also give useful clues to identify the crucial proteins of PHYMS and CMS in wheat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plant male sterility has been observed in numerous species (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Schnable and Wise, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Aalto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bachtrog <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) since it was first recorded by K&#xF6;lreuter in 1763. It is characterized by the absence or non-function of plant pollen grains, or the inability of plants to produce or release functional pollen grains. Male-sterile mutants (including physiological male-sterility; PHYMS) are of tremendous value as genetic tools in male development research and the use of heterosis (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eckardt, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014a</xref>). Despite it being suspected that it is closely related to mitochondrial function (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Linke and Borner, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">J.W. Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Heng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Touzet and Meyer, 2014</xref>), the genetic and molecular mechanisms of male sterility in wheat remain to be further elucidated.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Mitochondria play a pivotal role in energy metabolism and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and their dysfunction is associated with male sterility in plants (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eckardt, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Liu, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Horn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Touzet and Meyer, 2014</xref>). More recently, with the mitochondrial genome sequence completely elucidated in some higher plant species, there has been an increased application of genomic approaches to study anther development and pollen reproduction, for example in the monocotyledonous plants <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice) (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Notsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Clifton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and <italic>Triticum</italic> species (wheat) (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Ogihara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and dicotyledonous plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Unseld <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Handa, 2003</xref>), and <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> (tobacco) (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sugiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Many studies suggest that the mitochondrial genome is the carrier of fertility-related genes (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hanson and Bentolila, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Some of these genes and/or open reading frames (ORFs) encode pollen abortion-related proteins, such as ORF256 (7kDa) (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Song and Hedgcoth, 1994</xref>), ORF13 (13kDa) (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Klein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), ORF138 (19kDa) (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Yasumoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), ORF288 (32kDa) (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Jing <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), ORF79 (8.9kDa) (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Luan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), PCF (25kDa) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bentolila <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and WA352 protein (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, how these proteins mediate metabolic-induced male sterility still needs to be elucidated, and the protein&#x2013;protein interaction network remains largely unexplored, especially in wheat.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In the current study, physiological male-sterile Xinong 1376 (PHYMS-XN1376) plants (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014a, b</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), cytoplasmic male sterile Xinong 1376 (CMS-XN1376) plants, and their maintainer line (MF-XN1376) (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) were used. The isolation of floret mitochondria from wheat using Percoll density gradient methods is described. This is followed by the application of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis to compare the different expression patterns of floret mitochondrial proteins at the early uninucleate stage and the trinucleate stage. Seventy-one mitochondrial differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found to be involved in pollen abortion. Identification of these proteins combined with their changes in abundance as well as the impact of pollen development establishes a close linkage between mitochondria and male sterility. In the present study, a global view of the ubiquitous cellular changes associated with pollen abortion is revealed, and the existence of an intimate protein network elicited by mitochondrial mutation in male-sterile wheat is suggested. This network was further confirmed with other molecular biology techniques. The results provide insights into the molecular events of male sterility.</p>

        <p>PHYMS-XN1376 plants were treated with the new type of chemical hybridizing agent (CHA)-SQ-1; it has broad-spectrum properties and can lead to complete male sterility, as has been shown through pharmacodynamic experimental field tests. It also has no side effects on agronomic traits. Currently, SQ-1 has been used to produce hybrid seeds on a large scale, as has been previously described (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The PHYMS-XN1376, CMS-XN1376, and MF-XN1376 plants with the same nuclear background (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> nucleus) were grown conventionally in wheat fields at the experimental station of the Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, Yangling, China (108&#xB0;E, 34&#xB0;15&#x2019;N). The pollen developmental stages have been described previously (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Florets from which glumes and awns were removed (at the early uninucleate stage and the trinucleate stage, respectively) were harvested for isolation of mitochondria. Anthers at sequential stages (early uninucleate stage, binucleate stage, and trinucleate stage, respectively) were also collected.</p>

        <p>Mitochondria were isolated from florets according to <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> with minor modifications. Briefly, ~70g (fresh weight) of florets were homogenized with 700ml of ice-cold homogenization solution [0.3M mannitol, 50mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 2mM EGTA, 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-40, 0.5% (w/v) bovine seum albumin (BSA), 20mM ascorbate, pH 8.0] using a pre-cooled Waring blender. After filtering through four layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), the filtrates were centrifuged at 3000 <italic>g</italic> for 15min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 18 000 <italic>g</italic> for 20min. The resultant organelle pellet was resuspended in 300ml of wash buffer [0.3M mannitol, 10mM TES-NaOH (pH 7.5), and 0.1% (w/v) BSA] with the aid of a clean soft-bristle paint brush, and the two centrifugation steps were repeated to produce a washed organelle pellet. The final organelle pellet was resuspended in 10ml of wash buffer and loaded onto a three-step Percoll gradient composed of, from bottom to top, 40% (v/v) Percoll, 24% (v/v) Percoll, and 20% (v/v) Percoll, each Percoll solution containing 0.3M mannitol, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 10mM TES-NaOH (pH 7.5), and centrifuged at 40 000 <italic>g</italic> for 50min. The light yellow-brown bands of mitochondria at the 40% and 24% interfaces were collected with an injection needle and washed through 5&#xD7; dilutions in wash medium, and then centrifuged at 20 000 <italic>g</italic> for 10min.

The mitochondria-enriched pellet was resuspended in ~500 &#x3BC;l of wash buffer (minus 0.1% BSA), and used for the isolation of mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial activity was stained with 0.01M Janus green B as described previously (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), the integrity was assessed using a negative stain for transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi HT7700, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

Briefly, the images were initially processed through transformation, filtering, automated spot detection, normalization, and matching. All protein spots detected in-gel were matched to the corresponding spots of the master gel (Euns-MF) and each spot density was normalized against the whole gel densities. The volume of the spot corresponded to the amount of protein expressed. Normalized spot volumes were used to compare different samples statistically and to determine fold change values. Only the spots altered &gt;1.3-fold (<italic>P</italic>&#x2264;0.05) were considered as DEPs.</p>

Mass spectra were collected with a 5800 MALDI time of flight (TOF)/TOF&#x2122; analyser and analysed using TOF/TOF&#x2122; Series Explorer<sup>TM</sup> Software V4.1.0 (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA). Mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were recorded in a mass range from 700Da to 4000Da with a focus mass of 1700Da. For one main MS spectrum, 15 subspectra with 200 shots per subspectrum were accumulated, and for the MS/MS spectrum up to 25 subspectra with 250 shots per subspectrum were accumulated. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and MS/MS data were used to derive protein identity using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) applied to the NCBInr or Swiss-Prot databases. The main parameters were set as follows: S/N &#x2265;3.0; fixed modification, carbamidomethyl (Cys); variable modification, Gln&#x2192;pyro-Glu (N-term Q), and oxidation (Met); maximum number of missing cleavages, 1; MS tolerance, &#xB1;100 ppm.; and MS/MS tolerance, &#xB1;0.3Da.

        <title>Isolation of high-purity mitochondria from wheat florets</title>
        <p>The isolation of pure organellar fractions from crude source material is the critical phase of any subproteome analysis. It was previously established that very pure mitochondria can be obtained from wheat (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This established procedure was employed for the isolation of mitochondria with a recognized low contamination level.

The corresponding homologues with the highest similarity are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S7</ext-link>. All three proteins shared at least 80% positive identity with their homologues at the amino acid level, suggesting that they may have similar function. However, about one-third of the identified proteins were detected in multiple spots with different pIs or molecular masses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>), implying the existence of isoforms and post-translational modification.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Furthermore, based on the biological process of each gene product according to annotations in these databases coupled with the metabolic and functional features of pollen, all of these identities were classified into 12 functional groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), which covered a wide range of pathways and functions, including mitochondrial electron transport (mtETC) and ATP synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, molecular chaperones, protein biosynthesis and degradation, stress and defence, signal transduction, RNA processing, transcription factors, amino acid metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. An impressive 62% of these identified proteins were implicated in the first four functional groups, whereas the largest functional group was proteins related to mtETC/ATP synthesis (31%). The other three predominant categories were proteins related to the TCA cycle (10%), molecular chaperones (11%), and protein biosynthesis and degradation (10%).

The putative implications for the identified proteins in male sterility are discussed below.

        <title>Oxidative stress and tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) in anther</title>
        <p>Mitochondria are not only the sites of oxygen consumption but also one of the sources of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Salvato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). From the above results, the DEPs limited the electron transfer process and this was further confirmed by respiration assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S8</ext-link> at JXB online); this might disrupt the balance of oxidative stress, and further trigger PCD in the anther. Therefore, to confirm these possibilities further, the ROS levels and DNA damage were analysed.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">ROS contents and antioxidant enzyme activities were first measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>). The levels of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x2013;</sup> in PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 anthers were significantly higher than in MF-XN1376 from the early uninucleate stage to the trinucleate stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>); the levels increased rapidly and remained 20% higher in PHYMS-XN1376, and reached a maximum value of 133% in CMS-XN1376. Excess O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x2013;</sup> was catalysed to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The change of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content was similar to that of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x2013;</sup>; it apparently increased with anther development in PHYMS-XN1376 and reached a maximum value of 190% at the trinucleate stage, and remained 35% higher in CMS-XN1376 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). ROS scavenging depends on antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, and POD. However, in this experiment, the activities of these enzymes were significantly decreased in PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 anthers when excess ROS were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>), and this further disrupted the oxidative/antioxidative balance. Subsequently, excess ROS degraded polyunsaturated lipids to form MDA, and its level was significantly increased in anthers of PHYMS-XN1376 (maximum value of 147%) and CMS-XN1376 (maximum value of 432%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Moreover, RT-PCR analysis showed that two oxidation stress-related genes [ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase (PNDOR)] were down-regulated in PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). The above results indicate that the production of ROS overwhelmed the antioxidant capacity, which disrupted the balance between ROS production and clearance in male-sterile anthers; therefore oxidative stress occurred. Therefore, these results suggest that the oxidative stress of the anther in PHYMS-XN1376 was the same as that in CMS-XN1376.</p>

Excessive ROS <italic>in vivo</italic> may generate intermediate signals involved in PCD (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Y.

To investigate the abnormal PCD under oxidative stress in the anthers of PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 TUNEL, assays were then performed on anther sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S9</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). At the early uninucleate stage, the TUNEL fluorescence signal was detected in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 tapetal cells, suggesting that PCD occurred in the tapetum and was more strongly expressed in CMS-XN1376 than in PHYMS-XN1376. However, the TUNEL fluorescence signal was still not detected in microspores. Subsequently, from the binucleate stage to the trinucleate stage, TUNEL fluorescence showed stronger signals in the male-sterile tapetum and microspores. Then, the tapetal cells degraded completely and disappeared in PHYMS-XN1376 at the trinucleate stage and in CMS-XN1376 at the binucleate stage. These observations demonstrated that tapetum PCD commenced at the early uninucleate stage and it was degraded prematurely in PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation was apparently synchronized with excessive ROS levels.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">These results indicated that down-regulation of DEPs inhibited the mtETC. This inhibition was correlated with excess production of ROS and reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes; the microspores suffered from severe oxidative stress during pollen development. Then, the chronic oxidative stress triggered PCD and consequently resulted in the abortion of microspores.</p>

        <title>DEPs preferentially disturbed the mtETC and ATP synthesis</title>
        <p>Among the 12 functional groups, the largest of them was composed of proteins involved in mtETC/ATP synthesis, including 22 down-regulated proteins as listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online (spots 1&#x2013;22).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">There were 12 proteins participating in mtETC (spots 9&#x2013;20). In mitochondria, NADH dehydrogenase and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (also referred to as complex I) are the first and the largest enzyme of the mtETC. NADH initially binds to complex I and transfers high energy electrons to subsequent complexes (complex III. complex IV, and complex V). Remarkably, complex I is one of the main sites of premature electron leakage to oxygen (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Moller, 2001</xref>) and has a role in triggering apoptosis (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Petrussa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chomova and Racay, 2010</xref>). In the present study, in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 plants, their down-regulation (spots 9&#x2013;20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) limited the electron transfer process, promoting ROS generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>). If those ROS were not scavenged, superabundant ROS would then cause oxidative damage to cells, resulting in protein and DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and even cell death (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Foyer and Noctor, 2005</xref>). Here an inverse correlation was found between the level of intracellular ROS and the activities of anther SOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), and POD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Furthermore, applying the TUNEL assay, it was observed that anthers of PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 showed typical PCD characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S9</ext-link>). Additionlly, six COX subunits (spots 10&#x2013;15) were down-regulated in two male sterility samples; this altered cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase functionality or structure, which in turn inhibits electron transport from cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to oxygen. Therefore, the decreased abundance of the 12 proteins limited the mtETC and further affected pollen development.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Furthermore, representative subunits of ATP synthase were identified, including four &#x3B1;-subunits (spots 1&#x2013;4), three &#x3B2;-subunits (spots 5&#x2013;7), and one &#x3B4;-subunit (spot 8). Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase or complex V) plays an important role in energy metabolism by converting ADP into ATP in the presence of a transmembrane proton gradient (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sabar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The &#x3B2;-subunit is a catalytic site, which in combination with the &#x3B1;-subunit regulates the activity of ATP synthase. Recent studies of plant mitochondrial complexes indicate that several mitochondrial DNA regions encoding these ATP synthase subunits are associated with male sterility (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sabar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eckardt, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In this study, similar patterns were also observed for these subunits (spots 1&#x2013;8) that decreased in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). These might cause ATP synthase dysfunction and then impact on mitochondrial energy output and induce mitochondrial membrane potential changes, resulting in abnormal anther development with non-functional pollen.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Therefore, the present data suggest that the down-regulation of the 22 proteins not only slowed down the rate of electron transport in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 plants, but also caused excess electrons to combine with molecular oxygen to form ROS during pollen development, thus triggering PCD in the anther; these results are supported by the ROS measurement and TUNEL assay. More recently, research on plant male sterility has increase the focus of attention on ROS metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">K. Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The aberrant expression of mitochondrial genes compromised the increased demand for respiratory function and cellular energy in the form of ATP during anther development. The data presented here also show that the same expression patterns are seen in different types of a male-sterile (PHYMS and CMS) wheat line; this provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of male sterility in wheat.</p>

        <p content-type="indent">Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus. They are synthesized as precursor forms in the cytosol and must be imported into the mitochondria with the help of different protein translocases. Among these translocases, Tom40, the import channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane, plays an active role in sorting imported proteins. Mitochondrial Hsp70 and chaperonin CPN60 (Hsp60) are mitochondrial chaperones that are typically believed to be responsible for the transportation and refolding of pre-proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix. Furthermore, the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) removes the pre-sequences from the pre-proteins to form proteins (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Becker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2) belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family and performs the second step in the ubiquitination reaction that targets a protein for degradation via proteasomes (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Miao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

A variety of proteins (spots 36, 37, 42 49&#x2013;52, 60, and 61) were directly or indirectly involved in initiation and elongation of the newly growing peptide chains during this synthesis. Conversely, protein degradation was inhibited by the down-regulation of UBE2 (spot 43).

In addition, a range of antioxidant enzymes were down-regulated in this study (spots 44&#x2013;46; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>) and in previously published studies (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These changes led to excess electrons directly combining with molecular oxygen to generate excessive ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>) while reducing ATP production in PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 plants. On the one hand, the excessive ROS caused peroxidation of membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and resulted in increased permeability (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In this case, a large number of pre-proteins were rapidly translocated through the outer and inner membranes into mitochondria; there they combined with the up-regulation of Tom40 (spots 38 and 39), mtHsp70 (spot 30&#x2013;33), mtHsp60 (spots 34 and 35), and MPP (spots 40 and 41), and led to pre-proteins forming proteins; however, the down-regulation of UBE2 (spot 43) inhibited protein degradation. Eventually they increased the amount and abundance of mitochondrial proteins, including elongation factor G (spot 42), RNA helicase (spots 49 and 50), DNA replication licensing factor (spot 60), and site-specific recombinase (spot 61). Moreover, these extra proteins were involved in the biosynthesis of mitochondria-encoded proteins. Thus, the excessive ROS disturbed the balance between protein biosynthesis and degradation, which damaged the equilibrium of protein metabolism in mitochondria, and further affected pollen development. On the other hand, excessive ROS and reduced ATP as the primary signals, combined with the up-regulation of signal transduction proteins (spots 47 and 48), retrograde-regulated pollen development and ultimately led to pollen abortion. Furthermore, three proteins involved in the cell division cycle (spots 62 and 63) and nutrition storage (spot 64) displayed an abnormal change that hindered pollen development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">T</xref>) and the biosynthesis of starch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">U</xref>); this further aggravated abortion rates. Thus, abnormal cell division and lack of nutrients are also important factors in pollen abortion. The present data also suggest that PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 shared the above pathway with respect to mitochondrial-mediated male sterility.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">However, it should be noted that a number of enzymes (spots 23&#x2013;29), belonging to the TCA cycle, are only down-regulated in PHYMS-XN1376 at the early uninucleate stage and/or at the trinucleate stage. It is possible that the inhibition of TCA cycle enzymes can limit NADH production, energy, and carbohydrate metabolism in PHYMS-XN1376, which indirectly inhibited the mtETC, which has been confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (three energy supply-related genes aconitase, GAPDH, and NFUDP4) and <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This is unlike the abnormal mtETC in CMS-XN1376 plants which was directly inhibited by the related genes. Additionally, a variety of amino acid biosynthesis enzymes (spots 53, 54, and 56) were up-regulated in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 plants, and they generated excessive amino acids, including glycine, serine, and threonine. Tetrahydrofolate (spot 57), a one-carbon metabolism carrier only up-regulated in PHYMS-XN1376, converted these excessive amino acids into SAM (spots 58 and 59) which is involved in DNA methylation reactions. This is different from the process in CMS-XN1376 and has been documented by <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Ba <italic>et al.</italic> (2014b)</xref>. Therefore, the two abnormal pathways only exist in PHYMS-XN1376 but not in CMS-XN1376.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">2-DE analysis and putative functions revealed a highly interconnected protein network, which led to pollen abortion in wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This network was further confirmed by physiological data, RT-PCR, and TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The results showed that an increase in ROS levels was accompanied by inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 plants from the early uninucleate stage to the trinucleate stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis indicated that two oxidation stress-related genes (APX and PNDOR) and three energy supply-related genes (aconitase, GAPDH, and NFUDP4) were down-regulated in both PHYMS-XN1376 and CMS-XN1376 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). These changes imply that the inhibition of mtETC causes excessive ROS generation and a decrease in ATP. Furthermore, the TUNEL assay showed that the PCD in anther tissues was initiated at the early uninucleate stage and extended to the binucleate and trinucleate stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv322/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S9</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). These results support the hypothesis that inhibition of mtETC causes excessive ROS generation and a decrease in ATP which induces premature tapetal degeneration and pollen apoptosis, ultimately leading to pollen abortion. Additionally, protein ubiquitination and DNA methylation have been documented by <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> and <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Ba <italic>et al.</italic> (2014b)</xref>, respectively.</p>
        <p content-type="indent">Taken together, an intimate protein network of male sterility was proposed and confirmed based on proteomic screening and molecular biology. The results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of male sterility in wheat, which gives a useful guide for fertility restoration and the practical application of hybrid breeding.</p>
