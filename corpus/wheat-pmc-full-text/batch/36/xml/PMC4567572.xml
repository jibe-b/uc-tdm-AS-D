          <p>Abscisic acid (ABA) plays crucial roles in regulating plant growth and development, especially in responding to abiotic stress. The pyrabactin resistance-like (PYL) abscisic acid receptor family has been identified and widely characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, PYL families in rice were largely unknown.

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of <italic>OsPYL</italic> genes is tissue-specific and display differential response to ABA treatment, implying their functional diversity. The interaction between 10 OsPYL members and 5 protein phosphatase 2C in rice (OsPP2C) members was investigated in yeast two-hybrid and tobacco transient expression assays, and an overall interaction map was generated, which was suggestive of the diversity and complexity of ABA-sensing signaling in rice. To study the biological function of <italic>OsPYLs</italic>, two <italic>OsPYL</italic> genes (<italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic>) were overexpressed in rice. Phenotypic analysis of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> transgenic rice showed that <italic>OsPYLs</italic> positively regulated the ABA response during the seed germination. More importantly, the overexpression of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> substantially improved drought and cold stress tolerance in rice.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Abscisic acid (ABA) plays pivotal roles in regulating plant growth and development, including seed dormancy, germination, and seedling growth. More importantly, ABA is the key phytohormone that functions in a plant&#x2019;s response to abiotic stressors such as drought, high salinity, and extreme temperature (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). During abiotic stress, ABA biosynthesis is activated, resulting in an increase in ABA levels in the plant. ABA binds to the pyrabactin resistant-like/regulatory components of ABA receptors, PYL/RCAR (hereafter referred to as PYLs for simplicity), an ABA receptor family that promotes the interaction between PYL with protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), which then results in the release of SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK)) from the repression of PP2C. Finally, the active SnRK phosphorylates and activates downstream transcriptional factors that promote the expression of ABA-regulated genes. An ABA signal is then generated, which in turn results in the acquisition of abiotic stress resistance in plants (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Klingler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>). ABA receptor PYL proteins, which contain a conserved steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) protein domain, are the core components of this ABA sensing signaling pathway (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). To date, PYL proteins have been identified from distinct plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, tomato, and soybean, which present highly conserved PYL-mediated ABA-sensing signaling pathways (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Gonzalez-Guzman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). The biochemical property and structure of PYLs have been extensively studied in the dicot plant model <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Melcher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Klingler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; Joshi-Saha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). Some AtPYLs are monomers that facilitate interactions with PP2C in the absence of ABA; some AtPYLs are in a dimeric state and require ABA to form a complex with PP2C (Hao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). Recent studies have investigated the biological functions of various <italic>AtPYLs</italic>. The overexpression of <italic>AtPYL5</italic> leads to ABA hypersensitivity during early seedling development, as well as enhanced drought stress tolerance (Klingler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>). <italic>AtPYL8</italic> is involved in root growth and development, which is in line with its root-specific expression pattern (Antoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Although AtPYL13 is not an ABA receptor, it can positively regulate the ABA signaling pathway by interacting with and inhibiting both the PYL receptors and the PP2C co-receptors (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). AtPYL4<sup>A194T</sup> forms stable complexes with PP2CA in the absence of ABA, and the overexpression of AtPYL4<sup>A194T</sup> increases a plant&#x2019;s sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of germination and seedling establishment, as well as enhances drought resistance (Pizzio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). In addition, AtPYLs are largely functionally conserved, and the analysis of higher order mutants have indicated that AtPYLs regulate stomatal conductance (Gonzalez-Guzman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Unlike AtPYLs, information on PYL homologs in rice is limited. Studies have predicted that rice has 13 OsPYL members that share high sequence similarity with AtPYLs (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). Core components in ABA signaling, including OsPYLs, OsPP2C, OsSAPK2, and OsOREB1, have been identified in rice, and the ABA signaling transduction pathway has also been reconstituted in a protoplast system (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). The biochemical properties and structure of OsPYLs have also been recently reported (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). However, to date, only OsPYL/RCAR5 has been identified as a positive regulator in seed germination, early seedling growth, and drought and salt stress tolerance (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Other features of OsPYLs such as expression pattern, subcellular localization, interaction specificity with OsPP2C, and biological function, have not been examined.</p>
      <p>The present study examined the tissue-specific expression pattern and distinct response of <italic>OsPYL</italic> members to ABA treatment, which was suggestive of its differential biological function. An overall interaction map between 10 OsPYLs and 5 OsPP2C members indicated that OsPYLs were selective of their interaction partner, thus indicating the complexity and specificity of the rice ABA-sensing signaling pathway. Furthermore, using <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic>, we determined that <italic>OsPYLs</italic> play pivotal roles in ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination, as well as drought and cold stress tolerance, which thereby could serve as potential targets for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in rice.</p>

        <title>Expression Pattern of <italic>OsPYL</italic> Members</title>
        <p>Using the <italic>AtPYLs</italic> sequence as queries and search in the rice genome database, a total of 13 <italic>OsPYL</italic> orthologs were identified in rice. Among these, three (<italic>OsPYL</italic>11&#x2013;13) are thought to be nonfunctional that were caused by a large fragment deletion in the N or C terminal of the gene (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). To obtain an overview of the expression pattern of <italic>OsPYL</italic> members in different tissues, quantitative RT-PCR was performed. Because of the high level of sequence similarity among <italic>OsPYL</italic> members, it was difficult to design primers that could discriminate between <italic>OsPYL2</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic>, and <italic>OsPYL7</italic> and <italic>OsPYL8</italic>. Most of the <italic>OsPYLs</italic> were detected in all tissues, although differentially expressed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). <italic>OsPYL7</italic>/<italic>8</italic> was upregulated in embryos, <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL5</italic> were upregulated in leaves, <italic>OsPYL1</italic> in roots, and <italic>OsPYL2</italic>/<italic>9</italic> in all tissues (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). These diverse tissue-specific patterns of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> were indicative of its diverse biological functions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Tissue-specific and ABA-regulated expression of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> genes. <bold>a</bold> Tissue-specific expression of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in roots, leaves, stems, embryo, endosperm and panicles. The expression level of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> in roots was set as 1 and the fold change was analyzed via the 2<sup>-&#x25B3;&#x25B3;CT</sup> method using the rice <italic>ubiquitin</italic> gene as an internal control. Values represent the mean&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;SD of three biological replicates. <bold>b</bold> ABA-regulated expression of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Two-week-old seedlings were incubated in liquid MS medium containing 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;M ABA for 0, 1, 3 and 6&#xA0;h. The expression level of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> at 0&#xA0;h was set as 1 and the fold change was analyzed via the 2<sup>-&#x25B3;&#x25B3;CT</sup> method using the rice <italic>ubiquitin</italic> gene as an internal control. Values represent the mean&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;SD of three biological replicates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12284_2015_61_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p><italic>OsPYLs</italic> are also differentially expressed after ABA treatment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Some <italic>OsPYLs</italic> were downregulated such as <italic>OsPYL1</italic>, <italic>OsPYL2</italic>/<italic>9</italic>, and <italic>OsPYL3</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), whereas <italic>OsPYL4</italic> was upregulated (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The expression of <italic>OsPYL5</italic>, <italic>OsPYL7</italic>/<italic>8</italic>, and <italic>OsPYL10</italic> was not affected by ABA treatment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>OsPYL</italic> members play diverse roles in sensing the ABA signal.</p>

        <title>OsPYLs are Localized in the Cytosol and Nucleus</title>
        <p>To determine the subcellular localization of OsPYLs, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OsPYL fusion proteins driven by a 35S promoter were transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves. All tested OsPYLs were localized in both the cytosol and nucleus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), which were consistent with the results involving AtPYL9 and soybean GmPYL members (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>). These results indicated that PYLs of different plant species are localized in the same cellular regions, which might partly explain the functional conservation of PYL proteins as ABA receptors.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Subcellular localization of OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs.

        <title>OsPYL Members Selectively Interact with OsPP2C Members</title>
        <p>PYL family proteins, as functional ABA receptors, interact with clade A PP2Cs to form PYL-ABA-PP2C triple complexes that facilitate in the transmission of ABA signals (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Joshi-Saha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). A total of 10 predicted clade A OsPP2Cs have been identified in rice (Xue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>). In the present study, five clade A OsPP2Cs were isolated and investigated (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To determine whether OsPYLs interacted with these OsPP2Cs, yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted in the absence or presence of ABA. The results showed that the interaction between OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs was selective and specific (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Some OsPYLs interacted with all OsPP2C members, except for OsPYL2 and OsPYL10. Most interactions were ABA-dependent or ABA-enhanced. A few interactions were ABA-independent or constitutive such as that observed with OsPYL1 and OsPP2C53 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Most OsPYLs strongly interacted with OsPP2C30 and OsPP2C53 in an ABA-dependent or ABA-independent manner, respectively (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results demonstrated that OsPYLs bind to OsPP2Cs in diverse fashions and with different intensities. To confirm these interactions in plant cells, BiFC experiments in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were performed. The <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction results indicated that these could reproduce, as well as validated the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Based on the results of the yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays, an overall interaction map was generated between the 10 OsPYLs and 5 OsPP2C members (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results provide evidence that the tested OsPYLs were capable of functioning as ABA receptors, and that the ABA-sensing mechanism was conserved among different plants.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Interaction map between OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs.

        <title>OsPP2C Determines the Subcellular Localization of the OsPYLs-OsPP2C Complex in an ABA-independent Manner</title>
        <p>The results of the BiFC assay indicated that the subcellular localization of the fused green fluorescent proteins varied among different OsPYLs and OsPP2C members, and most of the OsPYL-OsPP2C complexes were localized in the nucleus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which is not consistent with the localization of OsPYLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To explore the underlying mechanism of this activity, the subcellular localization of five OsPP2C members was investigated. OsPP2C53 was localized to both the nucleus and cytosol, whereas other OsPP2C members were detected only in the nucleus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Comparative analysis showed a similarity between the subcellular localization of OsPP2C members and that of OsPYLs-OsPP2C complexes (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In the BiFC assay, ABA was also injected to test whether ABA affected the interaction between OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs. The results showed that ABA treatment only enhanced interaction strength, and did not affect the subcellular localization of the OsPYL-OsPP2C complexes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Consequently, the findings indicated that OsPP2C members can determine the subcellular localization of OsPYL-OsPP2C complexes in an ABA-independent manner.</p>

        <p>To determine whether <italic>OsPYLs</italic> are functional ABA receptors in rice, <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> were selected for further investigation. Constructs of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> driven by the <italic>35S</italic> promoter were transformed into rice, and more than 20 independent transgenic lines were produced for each gene. Three independent transgenic lines of each gene were chosen for further analysis. The expression levels of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> in the transgenic lines were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and RT-PCR, respectively (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> were overexpressed in the transgenic lines compared to the control lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). A seed germination assay was conducted to examine the ABA-related phenotype of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines.

        <p>Plants lose water mainly through stomata transpiration.

The water loss rate of the <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines was significantly slower than that observed in the controls (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). Relative water content (RWC) more accurately reflects the physiological consequence of cellular water deficit. Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">g</xref> shows that with drought stress, the <italic>OsPYL</italic> overexpression lines lost water at a slower rate and have a lower minimum relative water content that helped the plants survive during severe drought conditions. These results indicated that the <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines have a faster rate of stomatal closure and were hypersensitive to drought treatment compared to the controls, thereby contributing to a high level of drought stress tolerance.</p>

        <p>The rice seedlings were also subjected to cold stress. To examine whether <italic>OsPYLs</italic> played a role during cold stress response, a cold tolerance assay was performed. Two-week-old rice seedlings of similar size were incubated in a 10&#xA0;&#xB0;C growth chamber for 4&#xA0;days. After 4&#xA0;days, the leaves of the transgenic lines remained green and flats, and only the leaf tips were rolled up. In contrast, the leaves of the control lines were wilted, rolled up, and dry (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). After 7&#xA0;days of recovery at the normal temperature, the survival rate of the <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> transgenic plant was &gt;50&#xA0;%, compared to the &gt;95&#xA0;% death rate of the control lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>-<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). To evaluate the effect of cold stress on cell membranes, two-week-old rice seedlings were exposed to a 10&#xA0;&#xB0;C environment, and relative ion leakage was measured.

        <title>Expression of ABA-Regulated Genes is Enhanced in <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> Overexpression lines</title>
        <p>Because <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines showed significant drought and cold stress tolerance at the seedling stage, we were prompted to determine whether the expression of ABA-regulated genes was also enhanced in these transgenic lines. Several ABA-regulated genes (<italic>LEA3</italic>, <italic>RAB16A</italic>, and <italic>OsABA45</italic>) were selected, and its expressions levels between the control and <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines in response to ABA treatment were compared. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that ABA induced the expression of these genes, which was significantly higher than that observed in the controls (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Notably, in the absence of ABA treatment, the expression of these ABA-regulated genes was still higher in the <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines than that in the control, indicating that the overexpression of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> promoted the constitutive expression of ABA-regulated genes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), which possibly explains the delayed seed germination of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines in the absence of ABA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Members of the PYL protein family such as the ABA receptors and the core component in ABA-sensing signaling have been investigated in various plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, soybean, rice, and cucumber (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>; Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Compared to the extensive studies on AtPYLs, the property, function, and mechanism of OsPYLs are largely unknown. In the present study, based on amino acid sequence analysis of AtPYLs and predicted OsPYLs in the rice genome annotation project, 10 out of the 13 <italic>OsPYLs</italic> were cloned and studied. <italic>OsPYLs</italic> were differentially expressed in the leaves, stems, roots, panicles, embryo, and endosperm, and some <italic>OsPYL</italic> members showed pronounced tissue-specific expression patterns (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). <italic>OsPYLs</italic> also displayed a differential response to ABA treatment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The diverse expression patterns of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> were indicative of their functional diversity. All OsPYLs were localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), which was consistent with the results of previous reports on the subcellular localization of AtPYLs and GmPYLs (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>The interaction between the OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs was investigated in both yeast and tobacco, and an overall interaction map was generated between 10 OsPYLs and 5 OsPP2C members in the absence or presence of ABA treatment (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). OsPYLs selectively interacted with OsPP2Cs in ABA-dependent or ABA-independent manner. Combined with a recent report that OsPYLs inhibit OsPP2C activity (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>), these data suggest that OsPYLs are functional rice ABA receptors.</p>
      <p>In addition to the discovery of PYLs as ABA receptors, the present study has shown that these proteins also regulate ABA signaling and improve tolerance to abiotic stress. Overexpression of <italic>AtPYL4</italic> and <italic>AtPYL5</italic> leads to enhanced ABA hypersensitivity during seed germination and improved drought tolerance (Santiago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Pizzio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). In addition, the root-specific expression of <italic>AtPYL8</italic> regulates ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth (Antoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). However, information on the biological function of <italic>OsPYLs</italic> in rice, which is considered a monocot model, is limited. <italic>OsPYL5</italic> has been shown to positively regulate seed germination and drought stress response (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). In the present study, transgenic rice overexpressing <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> were produced and analyzed in detail (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). First, overexpression of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> conferred ABA hypersensitivity during seed germination (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>-<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">i</xref>). In addition, overexpression of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> in the absence of ABA significantly delayed seed germination, and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> played more important roles, which was consistent with the upregulation of <italic>OsPYL9</italic> in the embryo compared to that of <italic>OsPYL9</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>-<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">i</xref>). Second, overexpression of <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> enhanced drought stress tolerance, which can be partly explained by a slower water loss rate through the stomata in transgenic lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Third, <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines show increased membrane stability during cold stress and enhanced cold stress tolerance (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Last, expression of ABA-regulated genes in <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines was significantly higher than that in the controls (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), which accounted for the increased stress tolerance of transgenic plants. Interestingly, compared to the controls, <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> overexpression lines did not show any negative effect on growth, grain yield, and other observable phenotypes, whereas these were observed in <italic>OsPYL5</italic> (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). One possible explanation for this finding is that <italic>OsPYL5</italic> was directed by the maize <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promoter, which is a very strong promoter in monocots, and <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> was directed by the <italic>35S</italic> promoter, whose efficiency was less than that of <italic>ubiquitin</italic> in rice. Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>OsPYL3</italic> and <italic>OsPYL9</italic> can be used as a target gene for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in rice.</p>

The resultant constructs were transformed into the yeast strain Y2H gold. Presence of the transgenes was confirmed by growth on a SD/-Leu/-Trp plate. To assess protein interactions, the transformed yeast cells were suspended in liquid SD/-Leu/-Trp to OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0. The suspended cells were spread on plates containing SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp medium supplied with indicated concentration of 3-AT (3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole) and ABA. The interactions were observed after 4 days of incubation at 30 &#xB0;C. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation in tobacco</title>
        <p>For subcellular localization of OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs, full-length sequences of OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs were cloned into the pH7WGF vector via an LR recombination reaction, in which the OsPYLs and OsPP2Cs fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was drived by 35S promoter. For Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, OsPYLs were fused with the C-terminal portion of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) via an LR recombination reaction; OsPP2Cs were fused with the N-terminal portion of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) via an LR recombination reaction. For transient expression, the fusion constructs were transferred into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> GV3101. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain harboring each construct along with the <italic>p19</italic> strain were infiltrated into 4-week-old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. For staining of the nuclei, 10 mg/ml 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was infiltrated into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves 3 h before observation. For microscopic analyses, leaf discs were cut 3 d after infiltration. The fluorescence signal was observed using confocal microscopy.</p>

        <title>Analysis of genes expression</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNaseI. cDNA was synthesized from 2 &#xB5;g of total RNA using SuperscriptII Reverse Transcriptase. Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR master mix (TransStart). Data were collected using Bio-Rad chromo 4 real-time PCR detector. All expressions were normalized against the <italic>Ubiquitin</italic> gene. The primers used are listed at Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1.</p>

        <title>Germination and abiotic stress tolerance assay</title>
        <p>Dehulled seeds were surface-sterilized and planted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with indicated concentration of ABA (A1049, Sigma-Aldrich). Seed germination was defined as the coleoptiles emerged from the seed and scored every 12 h for 5 days. Three independent T3 homologous transgenic lines and the control Longjing 11 were used for stress tolerance experiments. For the dehydration treatment, rice plants grown for 3 weeks were withhold water for 10 days and then rehydrated and grown under normal conditions for 7 days. For cold treatment, 14-day-old seedlings were transferred to 10 &#xB0;C for 4 days and then returned to normal growth conditions for 7 days. The survival rates were recorded. Approximately 50 seedlings of each line were used for each experiment, and three replicates of each experiment were performed. Tests for statistical analysis between transgenic lines and the controls were performed using Microsoft excel 2007.</p>

        <title>Water loss assay and measurement of relative electrolyte leakage</title>
        <p>For water loss assay, leaves of control and <italic>OsPYLs</italic> transgenic plants grown under normal conditions were detached from 3-week-old seedlings and weighed immediately on a piece of weighing paper, and then placed on a laboratory table and weighed at indicated time intervals. Three replicates were performed for each line.</p>
        <p>For relative water content measurement (RWC), Three-week-old seedlings of control and three independent OsPYLs transgenic lines were withhold water. The protocol was as described by (Barrs and Weatherley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1962</xref>). RWC was measured until the leaf cannot expand during dipped in the water. </p>
        <p>Two-week-old seedlings of control and three independent <italic>OsPYLs</italic> transgenic lines were transferred into a 10 &#xB0;C chamber. At 0 d, 2 d and 3 d, 0.5 g of leaves were harvested from each of ten plants. Leaf fragments were immersed in 6 mL deionized water and shaken at 100 rpm at 25 &#xB0;C for 2 h, and electrical conductivity was determined (C1). The samples were then boiled for 20 min, and the total conductivity was determined again (C2) after cooling to room temperature. Relative ion leakage (%) was calculated as C1/C2 &#xD7; 100.</p>
