        <p>Although wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) pericarp starch granule (PSG) has been well-studied, our knowledge of its features and mechanism of accumulation and degradation during pericarp growth is poor. In the present study, developing wheat caryopses were collected and starch granules were extracted from their pericarp to investigate the morphological and structural characteristics of PSGs using microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Relative gene expression levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (<italic>APGase</italic>), granule-bound starch synthase II (<italic>GBSS II</italic>), and &#x3B1;-amylase (<italic>AMY</italic>) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. PSGs presented as single or multiple starch granules and were synthesized both in the amyloplast and chloroplast in the pericarp. PSG degradation occurred in the mesocarp, beginning at 6 days after anthesis. Amylose contents in PSGs were lower and relative degrees of crystallinity were higher at later stages of development than at earlier stages. Short-range ordered structures in the external regions of PSGs showed no differences in the developing pericarp. When hydrolyzed by &#x3B1;-amylase, PSGs at various developmental stages showed high degrees of enzymolysis. Expression levels of <italic>AGPase</italic>, <italic>GBSS II</italic>, and <italic>AMY</italic> were closely related to starch synthesis and degradation. These results help elucidate the mechanisms of accumulation and degradation as well as the functions of PSG during wheat caryopsis development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops cultivated worldwide. Wheat caryopsis contains an abundance of nutrients, including starch, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and phytochemicals [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Starch is the major stored carbohydrate in wheat caryopsis and accounts for approximately 65% to 75% of caryopsis dry weight [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Wheat caryopsis consists of the germ (embryo and scutellum), endosperm, and pericarp [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The pericarp, which lies in the outermost layers of the caryopsis, is composed of three layers, namely, the epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During wheat caryopsis development, starch granules are mainly synthesized in the endosperm and pericarp within a double-membrane-bound organelle called the plastid [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Two types of plastids have been identified: the amyloplast, in which starch granules are synthesized and accumulate for long periods of time, and the chloroplast, in which photosynthesis takes place and transitory starch is synthesized [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Transitory starch is considered both an overflow for newly assimilated carbon and storage for carbohydrates during periods of darkness when photosynthesis is impossible. Transitory starch usually appears in non-storage tissues and organs, such as the pericarp and leaves, in higher plants [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Starch is composed of two major glucose polymers, namely, amylose and amylopectin, which differ in their degree of polymerization of glucan chains [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The key enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis (<xref rid="pone.0138228.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) are ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), soluble starch synthase (SSS), starch branching enzyme (SBE) and starch debranching enzyme (DBE). AGPase is the key enzyme bringing about the first step of starch synthesis. GBSS is responsible for amylose synthesis in plant organs. Two isoforms of GBSS exist: GBSS I, which exists in storage organs, such as parenchymal cells of potato tubers and caryopsis endosperm cells of Gramineae crops, and GBSS II, which can only be detected in non-storage organs or tissues, such as the pericarp, leaf, and stem [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the process of wheat seed germination, &#x3B1;-amylase (AMY) catalyzes starch hydrolysis into maltose. Thereafter, maltose is hydrolyzed into glucose by maltase (<xref rid="pone.0138228.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>In cereal crop endosperm cells, starch granules are synthesized in the amyloplast and increase in number and volume until caryopsis maturity [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The morphological and physicochemical properties of starch granules change during each phase of endosperm development in cereal crops, such as rice and wheat [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, unlike endosperm starch granules, pericarp starch granules (PSGs) exhibit dynamic changes during caryopsis development. Several reports concerning the development of PSGs of Gramineae crops have been published. PSGs are spherical in shape at the early stages of maize kernel development [6&#x2013;12 days after anthesis (DAA)] but become irregular and polygonal at later stages (14&#x2013;30 DAA). By contrast, amylose contents, amylopectin structures, and the thermal properties of PSGs remain similar across different developmental stages [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Starch granules in <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) pericarp consist of multiple starch granules; they present high accumulations in the mesocarp at early stages of caryopsis development but eventually disappear at maturity [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In rice caryopsis pericarp, starch granules accumulate in plastids in exterior cells and accumulate in chloroplasts in inner cells, including cross cells, but gradually degrade as caryopsis development proceeds [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In wheat pericarp, starch granules are synthesized in amyloplasts or chloroplasts from anthesis to 11 DAA but gradually disappear after 11 DAA [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar results have been reported by Yu et al. (2015) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], who pointed out that PSGs exhibit a typical accumulation peak at 5 DAA and then gradually decompose until 22 DAA. Xiong et al. (2013) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied the structural and physiological features of wheat pericarp development and found that PSGs accumulate in mesocarp cells at 3 DAA, reach maximum accumulation at 9 DAA, and completely disappear after 15 DAA.</p>
      <p>Although the accumulation characteristics of PSGs are well-studied, other characteristics, such as starch granule development in different pericarp regions as well as the structural characteristics and physicochemical properties of PSGs in developing wheat caryopsis, remain poorly understood. Moreover, our knowledge of the amylose content, relative expression of the related synthetic and degradation enzyme genes (<italic>AGPase</italic>, <italic>GBSS II</italic>, and <italic>AMY</italic>), and degradation mechanisms of PSGs remains limited. In our previous study, the development and physicochemical properties of PSGs and endosperm starch granules were compared [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on those findings, dynamic changes in PSGs were systematically analyzed at the morphological, structural, physiological, physicochemical, and molecular levels in the present study. Our results provide novel insights into the functions of PSGs and their mechanisms of accumulation and degradation during wheat caryopsis development. Furthermore, our findings hold broad implications for the fields of plant development, plant physiology, and molecular biology.</p>

        <p>The high-yielding hard winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. cv. Yannong 19) seeds used in the present study were purchased from the National Wheat Improvement Center (Yangzhou, China) and grown in the experimental field of Yangzhou University (32&#xB0;39'N, 119&#xB0;42'E), Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province from September 2013 to May 2014. The field soil was sandy loam (Typic fluvaquents, Entisols (US taxonomy)) that contained 24.5 g kg<sup>-1</sup> organic materials as well as 106, 33.8, and 66.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of available N, P, and K, respectively. The climate condition represented a transition from humid subtropical monsoon climate to temperate monsoon climate. The average annual temperature was 15.2&#xB0;C and the annual rainfall was 961&#x2013;1048 mm. The plants received normal fertilizer and water supply during growing stages. To determine the anthesis date accurately, individual florets were marked at the base of the spikelet in the middle of spikes and whole plants were tagged.</p>

        <title>Starch granule extraction</title>
        <p>Fresh wheat caryopses were collected 2, 6, 10, and 20 DAA and kept at &#x2013;20&#xB0;C until starch extraction. The pericarp was separated from the caryopsis by hand and immediately immersed in absolute ethyl alcohol to inactivate its enzymes. Starch granules were extracted from the pericarp following the method of Yu et al. (2015) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with slight modifications. The separated pericarp was ground with 0.2% NaOH solution in a mortar, and the ground sample was filtered through 12 gauze layers. The filtrate was then centrifuged at 2,500 &#xD7;<italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 25&#xB0;C, and the yellow green gel containing the protein and tissue fragments was scraped from the starch granules. This step was repeated four to five times until no more gel could be obtained. Finally, the starch samples were washed twice with distilled water and absolute ethyl alcohol and dried at 40&#xB0;C for 48 h.</p>

        <p>The separated pericarp was dried in an oven at 110&#xB0;C for 3 h and completely ground in a mortar. The powder obtained was used to determine total starch and soluble sugar contents via total starch (QY1-1; Comin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) and soluble sugar (SY3-2; Comin Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) kits. Amylose contents in the extracted starch were determined using an amylose determination kit (K-AMYL; Megazyme Ltd., Ireland).</p>

        <title>Structural observation</title>
        <p>Caryopses were collected 2, 6, 10, and 20 DAA and cut breadthwise into 2 mm-thick slices from the center. Samples were immediately immersed in 0.1 M glutaraldehyde-phosphate buffer fixative (pH 7.2) at 4&#xB0;C for 3 h and then fixed with 0.5% OsO<sub>4</sub> for 3 h. Fixed samples were subsequently rinsed, dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded according to the method described by Zheng and Wang (2011) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>For light microscopy, samples were cut into 1 &#x3BC;m slices using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut R, Leica, Germany), stained with 0.5% methyl violet for 10 min, and photographed under a light microscope (DMLS, Leica, Germany).</p>
        <p>For transmission electron microscopy, samples were cut into 60 nm slices using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut R, Leica, Germany), respectively stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for 30 and 15 min, and photographed under a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai 12, Philips, Holland).</p>
        <p>For fluorescence microscopy, caryopses were collected and cut breadthwise into 1 mm-thick slices from the center. Samples were placed on a microslide and observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope (DMLB, Leica, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (Power Shot S50, Canon, Japan).</p>
        <p>For scanning electron microscopy, 1 mg of starch was mixed with 500 &#x3BC;L of absolute ethyl alcohol. The mixture (20 &#x3BC;L) was placed in a stage groove and dried at 40&#xB0;C for 1 h. Samples were then gold-sputtered under vacuum and photographed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; S4800, Hitachi, Japan). The accelerating voltage and current of the instrument were 15 kV and 10 &#x3BC;A, respectively. The size distribution of starch granules in the micrographs was analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software (Version 6.0, Media Cybernetics, USA). A total of 200 starch granules were combined into one sample, and the means of three replicate samples (600 total) were used for calculations.</p>

        <title>X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis</title>
        <p>XRD was used to investigate the crystalline structure of starch granules including the crystalline type and relative degree of crystallinity. Prior to determination, starch samples were stored in a closed container containing 100 mL of saturated NaCl solution maintained under a constant-humidity atmosphere (relative humidity = 75%) for 7 d. Wet starch samples were placed on a vitric sample platform and scanned at diffraction angles (coupled 2&#x3B8;) from 4&#xB0; to 40&#xB0; with a step size of 0.2 s. The ratio of the crystallinity area to the total diffraction area was calculated as the relative degree of crystallinity (%) from the XRD patterns obtained using Image-Pro Plus software (Version 6.0, Media Cybernetics, USA) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

        <p>An FTIR spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) system was used to analyze ordered structures in the external region of the starch granules [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Starch (30 mg) was mixed with 25 &#x3BC;L of distilled water, and the resulting slurry was placed on the sample platform of an FTIR spectrometer (Varian 7000, Varian, USA). FTIR spectra were recorded from 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 800 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and then deconvoluted with a resolution enhancement factor of 1.9 and a half-width of 19 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Infrared (IR) absorbance bands at 1045, 1022, and 995 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> were measured by recording the height of the bands from baseline to peak point.</p>

        <p>Amylose and short chains of amylopectin formed a double helix structure (long-range ordered stucture). Meanwhile, these double-helical molecules held the crystalline stucture (short-range ordered stucture) within starch granules via intermolecular interaction forces.

        <title>Accumulation and degradation mechanism of PSGs</title>
        <p>PSGs accumulate in both amyloplasts and chloroplasts, which is in line with the findings reported by Yu et al. (2015) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similar results have also been reported in other cereal crop caryopses, such as barley [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], rice [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and sorghum [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The PSGs are also found in two main regions of wheat pericarp, namely, cross cells and MCVP. This may be associated with the biological characteristics of this species. As reported by Zheng and Wang (2015) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], accumulate only in amyloplasts in this crop. The nutrient transfer tissues of wheat are much less advanced than those of maize [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As such, the chlorophyll-containing layer in wheat caryopsis may produce photosynthetic products and provide extra nutrients for pericarp development at early developmental stages; during this time, nutrient transfer tissues are not well differentiated [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
        <p>PSGs began to appear at 6 DAA and then gradually disappeared until 20 DAA. This phenomenon may be explained in two ways: (1) from 6 DAA to 20 DAA, endosperm cells undergo a period of material enrichment, including protein body and starch granule synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0138228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The number and volume of endosperm cells rapidly increase during this period, but the size of the caryopsis increases only slightly (<xref rid="pone.0138228.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Extensive endosperm cell expansion causes mesocarp cells to deform, crack, and degrade. (2) The <italic>AMY</italic> gene shows significantly higher relative expression at 6 DAA than at 2 DAA. Laethauwer et al. (2013) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that increased &#x3B1;-amylase activity was associated with increased <italic>AMY</italic> gene expression in winter types of triticale. Thus, the <italic>AMY</italic> gene product &#x3B1;-amylase likely catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch granules from 6 DAA to 20 DAA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec022">
        <title>Changes in total starch, soluble sugar and amylose contents</title>
        <p>Dynamic changes in total starch and soluble sugar contents reveal that decreases in soluble sugar contents from 2 DAA to 6 DAA may support starch synthesis, which results in increases in total starch content. These results are consistent with the relative expression of the <italic>AGPase</italic> gene, which activates the first step of starch biosynthesis and shows increases from 2 DAA to 6 DAA and decreases from 6 DAA to 20 DAA. From 6 DAA to 10 DAA, soluble sugar contents increased rapidly and starch granule hydrolysis could be observed. From 10 DAA to 20 DAA, both total starch and soluble sugar contents decreased, which indicates that these carbohydrates are not only responsible for pericarp survival but also provide additional nutrients for endosperm growth. Similar ideas have been proposed previously by Yu et al. (2015) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Zhou et al. (2009) [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
        <p>GBSS is the only starch synthase that is found exclusively within starch granules and controls amylose synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. GBSS II is an isoform of GBSS expressed in wheat pericarp [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The <italic>GBSS II</italic> gene showed higher relative expression from 2 DAA to 6 DAA than at later stages, indicating that the activity of amylose synthesis was greater at early stages than that at later stages. When starch was hydrolyzed by amylase, the amorphous region containing amylose was degraded first, followed by the crystalline region containing amylopectin molecules [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This may account for the lower amylose contents observed in subsequent days (10 and 20 DAA).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec023">
        <title>Morphological and structural changes in PSGs</title>
        <p>PSGs were found to have not only large granule sizes but also rough granule surfaces, which could be caused by &#x3B1;-amylase attack. When hydrolyzed by &#x3B1;-amylase, the degree of enzymolysis of PSGs followed the order: 2 DAA&gt;6 DAA&gt;10 DAA&gt;20 DAA. These results could be due to the ratio of surface area to volume of granules, since previous studies demonstrated that starch granules with smaller sizes show higher degrees of enzymolysis [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, PSGs were almost completely hydrolyzed by &#x3B1;-amylase, with degrees of enzymolysis ranging from 96% to 99% at 24 h. When hydrolyzed by &#x3B1;-amylase using the same method adopted in the present study, degrees of enzymolysis of about 82% and 7% were obtained at 72 h for normal rice starch and potato starch, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Incomplete starch degradation may be attributed to the resistant-starch content of the sample under study [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As temporary energy storage materials, the high degree of enzymolysis of PSGs may provide more nutrients for pericarp metabolism.</p>
        <p>XRD and ATR-FTIR are advanced technologies that have been successfully used to study long-range ordered structures of whole granules and short-range ordered structures of external regions of starch granules, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138228.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The relative degrees of crystallinity (long-range ordered structure) of PSGs were significantly higher at 10 and 20 DAA than at 2 and 6 DAA. The ATR-FTIR absorption bands at 1045 and 1022 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> are associated with crystalline lamellar and amorphous structures, respectively, while the band at 995 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> is attributed to the bending vibrations of C&#x2013;OH bonds [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The IR ratios of 1045 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>/1022 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 1022 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>/995 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> are considered quantitative indices for evaluating the short-range ordered structures of starch granules [<xref rid="pone.0138228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, ATR-FTIR revealed a lack of significant differences in short-range ordered structures in the external regions of these granules. These results demonstrate that structural changes in PSGs take place only in the internal regions of granules rather than external regions.</p>
