      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fossil-based hydrocarbon fuels for generating energy, such as coal and crude oil, are finite resources and at the present rate of human consumption are predicted to be completely depleted by 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139129.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An alternative, renewable source of energy is lignocellulosic residue from agricultural, forestry, municipal or industrial processes [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Sugars can be released from the lignocellulosic feed stocks using industrial pre-treatment processes, followed by enzymatic digestion and then converted to transportation biofuels, such as bioethanol or biobutanol by microbial fermentation [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is currently used for the production of bioethanol, first generation bioethanol production has involved the conversion of hexose sugars derived from sucrose present in crops such as sugar cane in Brazil and from starch in crops such as maize in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Use of lignocellulosic feed stocks for biofuel production is more challenging, in order to increase fermentation efficiency, the problem of pre-treatment generated inhibitor compounds, and fermentation stresses, also have to be addressed. Pre-treatment of lignocellulose to release constituent sugars results in the release of aromatic and acidic compounds such as acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, hydroxy-methyl furfural (HMF), and vanillin [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that are detrimental to the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. In addition, fermentations carried out within bioreactors generates further problems, such as osmotic stress due to high sugar levels, elevated heat and increasing ethanol concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, resistance to all these fermentation stresses are desirable phenotypic attributes for improved bioethanol productivity.</p>
      <p>Using a systems biology approach and a phenotypic microarray assay we previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with response to weak acids [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], recipricol hemizygosity analysis of genes within the loci highlighted the potential role of <italic>COX20</italic> in weak acid response [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Cytochrome C oxidase activity has been associated with programmed cell death (PCD) in yeast [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where a loss of function along with addition of acetic acid has been shown to induce PCD [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cytochrome C release has been shown to involve the ATP/ADP carrier as a component of the mitochondrial outer membrane [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and has been shown to be released in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Yeast strains with altered cytochrome C oxidase activity maybe more tolerant to the inducement of PCD by acetic acid, the importance of cytochrome C oxidase has been reported in work on improving acetate tolerance in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>COX20</italic> encodes for a chaperone that facilitates proteolytic processing of the mitochondrial gene product Cox2p and its assembly into the mitochondrial inner membrane cytochrome C oxidase complex [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the work reported here, <italic>COX20</italic> was expressed using tetracycline-regulatable vectors [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in a &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strain and response to acetic acid was measured using phenotypic microarrays and during fermentation. Incomplete assembly or mis-functioning cytochrome C oxidases have been associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress in the yeast cell [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] so the effect of oxidative stress on COX20 was also investigated.</p>

The wild type and all the transformed strains were assessed for expression of COX20 on a SDS-PAGE gel (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). COX20 has a predicted molecular weight of 23 KDa [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The two strains demonstrated similar metabolic activity under control (no acetic acid) conditions but the &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strain was characterised by an increase in acetic acid sensitivity when compared with wild-type in particular at higher concentrations. The impact of the overexpression of <italic>COX20</italic> on tolerance to acetic acid was then assessed, &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strains which had been transformed with plasmids (pCM161 or pCM173) containing <italic>COX20</italic> under a tetracycline-regulatable promoter were assessed for acetic acid tolerance in comparison with their empty vector controls (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Presence of empty vectors (pCM161 or pCM173) had no discernible effect on tolerance to 75 mM acetic acid when compared to the &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> background (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). However, &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strains containing the overexpression vectors pCM161(<italic>COX20</italic>) or pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) displayed increased tolerance to 75 mM acetic acid as compared to their corresponding empty vector controls (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The effect of pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) being particularly effective at increasing metabolic activity, compatible with the fact that this construct employs a stronger promoter. Protein expression using a pCM173 vector has been shown to be higher when compared with expression level using a pCM161 vector [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Assays with &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strains expressing <italic>COX20</italic> in a pCM161 plasmid appeared to recover the phenotype when compared with wild-type for the first 30 hours of the assay; after this time point there was no further increase metabolic output when compared with wild-type. For this reason all further studies were undertaken using the pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) strain. Tolerance to acetic acid was further confirmed in assays using 100 mM acetic acid in which a strain with an empty vector was sensitive whereas a strain overexpressing COX20 was resistant (<xref rid="pone.0139129.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>).</p>

        <p>The growth of yeast strains overexpressing <italic>COX20</italic> was determined in the presence of acetic acid and compared with the empty vector control.

        <title>Confirmation of phenotypic microarray strain assessments using mini-fermentation analysis</title>
        <p>Performance of yeast strains in fermentations under acetic acid stress was assessed. The &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strain carrying either an empty vector (pCM173) or overexpressing <italic>COX20</italic> (pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>)) were used in fermentations carried out under control (no acetic acid) or in the presence of 75 mM acetic acid and fermentation efficiency monitored gravimetrically. SD-trp media was used to maintain selection criteria for the plasmid (<xref rid="pone.0139129.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Under control conditions, there was no discernible difference in fermentation profiles between the two strains (p = 0.8765) (<xref rid="pone.0139129.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) strain was tolerant to the presence of acetic acid when compared with an empty vector control strain (p = 0.0006) (<xref rid="pone.0139129.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). When fermentation profiles for the pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) strain were compared under control and acetic acid stress conditions, there were no significant differences (p = 0.427) (<xref rid="pone.0139129.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>The fermentation outputs of the two strains under control and 75 mM acetic acid stress were also assessed in terms of glucose utilisation and ethanol production (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Under control conditions, it was observed that there was no difference in glucose utilisation or ethanol production between the strains with either the empty vector or pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) (p = 0.861) (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Addition of 75 mM acetic acid significantly reduced glucose utilisation and ethanol production in the empty vector control strain as compared to the strain overexpressing <italic>COX20</italic> (p = 0.0168) (<xref rid="pone.0139129.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This data were used to assess the efficiency of the conversion of glucose into ethanol. Under control conditions, the empty vector &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> control strain had 0.48 &#xB1; 0.011 g ethanol/g glucose conversion efficiency, and the pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) strain had an efficiency of 0.49 &#xB1; 0.007 ethanol/g glucose conversion after 12 hours. In the presence of 75 mM acetic acid, the &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> control strain had a 0.08 &#xB1; 0.008 ethanol/g glucose conversion whereas the pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) strain had a 0.49 &#xB1; 0.045 ethanol/g glucose conversion. The theoretical maxima is 0.511 g ethanol per g of glucose consumed [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], therefore the pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>) strain is converting glucose into ethanol at near theoretical maximum in the presence of 75 mM acetic acid. The impact of pH was measured on pCM173 and pCM173(<italic>COX20</italic>), selective media was adjusted to a pH analogous to the addition of 25, 50 or 75 mM acetic acid using phosphoric acid and fermentation rates monitored. Presence of acetic acid in a fermentation using either empty vector (pCM173) or (pCM173(COX20)) was unchanged under control conditions or in the presence of acetic acid (<xref rid="pone.0139129.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Results revealed that presence of COX20 had no discernible effect on tolerance to pH when compared with the empty vector (pCM173) control (data not shown).</p>

        <p>We assessed for the importance of overexpressing <italic>COX20</italic> when utilising hydrolysates derived from the acid pre-treatment of wheat, hydrolysates with glucose added were assessed using a phenotypic microarray assay.

These strains overexpress COX20 using a tryptophan auxotrophy as a selection requirement, these hydrolysates do contain tryptophan (data not shown) so the selection pressure for maintain strains containing the vector would be lost.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Presence of acetic acid is an unavoidable consequence of pre-treatment of lignocellulosic material into fermentable sugars [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139129.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which will inhibit yeast performance in fermentations. Previous work identified <italic>COX20</italic> up-regulated under acetic acid stress; however, the importance of the gene had not been fully examined. <italic>COX20</italic> encodes for a gene whose function is essential for the maturation of the mitochondrially encoded Cox2p, the pre-cursor of cytochrome C oxidase in yeast [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Presence of acetic acid (20&#x2013;80 mM) has been shown to induce programmed cell death (PCD) [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], either involving mitochondria (intrinsic pathway) or a pathway involving cytosolic caspases called the extrinsic pathway [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139129.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The toxicity of acetic acid is pH dependent, acetic acid in its undissociated form diffuses through the cell membrane and dissociation is dependent on cytosolic pH. Intracellular pH is maintained through ATPase transporter systems transporting protons across the cell membrane [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>During fermentations, low concentrations of acetic acid (&lt; 25 mM) stimulate ATP production, and under anaerobic conditions the rate of ethanol production increases compared with the rate in the unstressed control [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At higher concentrations (&gt;25 mM) the stimulation in ATP production is overtaken by a lowering in cytosolic pH and an increase in ATPase activity.</p>
      <p>Deletion of <italic>COX20</italic> had no discernible effect under control conditions; however, in the presence of acetic acid, a &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strain was sensitive when compared with the background strain. Overexpression of <italic>COX20</italic> increased tolerance to acetic acid, strains carrying a tetracycline-regulatable vector containing <italic>COX20</italic> showing no inhibition in the presence of 75 mM acetic acid. Placing <italic>COX20</italic> under a tetracycline-regulatable promoter allowed us to control tolerance to acetic acid as addition of tetracycline suppressed expression and returned a &#x394;<italic>cox20</italic> strain back to acetic acid sensitivity. As pre-treatment conditions become more stringent, concentrations of weak acids such as acetic, formic and levulinic acid also increase [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139129.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] along with increasing concentrations of monomeric fermentable sugars [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] making a fermentation into bioethanol more viable [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The role of cytochrome C oxidases in acetic acid induced PCD has been well established, however this is the first report of overexpression of a gene product that could impact cytochrome C oxidase increasing tolerance to acetic acid during fermentation. Overexpression of <italic>COX20</italic> allowed conversion of glucose into ethanol at close to the theoretical maximum yield in the presence of 75 mM acetic acid.</p>
      <p>Mitochondria are the major site within the cell for the generation of ROS, and incorrect assembly of cytochrome C oxidase complexes has been associated with accumulation of ROS within the yeast cell [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We assessed the impact of overexpressing <italic>COX20</italic> on cells under hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and observed an improved metabolic output, growth and viability in those strains when compared with empty vector control.</p>
      <p>Acetic acid tolerance in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> spp has been defined previously [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139129.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with considerable variation observed within the species. Determining if cytochrome C oxidase activity in these strains correlated with tolerance would be of interest.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Results here revealed that use of tetracycline-regulated system in a fermentation correlated expression of a desired gene with a phenotype; this work follows up a similar study from our previous research group [<xref rid="pone.0139129.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cytochrome C oxidase activity under acetic acid stress has been highlighted previously as pre-cursors for programmed cell death in yeast; however expression of <italic>COX20</italic> correlating with acetic acid or oxidative tolerance has not been shown previously. <italic>COX20</italic> expression correlated with a tolerant phenotype to acetic acid and this tolerance was reverted upon addition of tetracycline into the assay.</p>
