        <p>LHY (late elongated hypocotyl) is an important gene that regulates and controls biological rhythms in plants. Additionally, LHY is highly expressed in the SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) cDNA library-induced stripe rust pathogen (CYR32) in our previous research. To identify the function of the LHY gene in disease resistance against stripe rust, we used RACE-PCR technology to clone <italic>TaLHY</italic> in the wheat variety Chuannong19. The cDNA of <italic>TaLHY</italic> is 3085 bp long with an open reading frame of 1947 bp. <italic>TaLHY</italic> is speculated to encode a 70.3 kDa protein of 648 amino acids , which has one typical plant MYB-DNA binding domain; additionally, phylogenetic tree shows that <italic>TaLHY</italic> has the highest homology with LHY of <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>(<italic>BdLHY-like</italic>). Quantitative fluorescence PCR indicates that <italic>TaLHY</italic> has higher expression in the leaf, ear and stem of wheat but lower expression in the root. Infestation of CYR32 can result in up-regulated expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic>, peaking at 72 h. Using VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) technology to disease-resistant wheat in the fourth leaf stage, plants with silenced <italic>TaLHY</italic> cannot complete their heading stage. Through the compatible interaction with the stripe rust physiological race CYR32, Chuannong 19 loses its immune capability toward the stripe rust pathogen, indicating that <italic>TaLHY</italic> may regulate and participate in the heading of wheat, as well as the defense responses against stripe rust infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>TFs (transcription factors) are protein molecules that can specifically bind to the cis-acting elements in the promoter region of eukaryotic genes. They can activate or inhibit the transcription of the target genes by interaction with other related proteins[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MYB is one of the largest plant transcription factor gene families, all of which have a highly conservative DNA binding domain. The binding domain normally includes 1&#x2013;3 incompletely repeating sequences (Rs), and each R segment comprises approximately 52 conserved amino acid residues and intervening sequences, folding into a helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the quantity of repeating R segments, MYB transcription factors can be simply divided into four sub-categories: 1R proteins (R1/R2-MYB), 2R proteins (R2R3-MYB), 3R proteins (R1R2R3-MYB) and 4R proteins (R1R2R2R1/R2-MYB)[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>MYB transcription factors are widely used in the regulation of secondary metabolism in plant[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as well as the response to hormone and environmental factors[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, they play an important role in the regulation of plant cell differentiation, organogenesis[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], leaf morphogenesis, and disease resistance[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, the cotton gene <italic>GhMYBl09</italic> plays a direct role in the formation, elongation and growth of cotton fiber[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Over-expression of the <italic>AtMYB24</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may result in stunted plant growth and malnutrition of its flower organs[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The <italic>AtMYB30</italic> gene is a positive regulation factor of the hypersensitive response (HR) when <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is upon bacterial infection[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, MYB transcription factors such as AS1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], PHAN in <italic>Antirrhinum</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], NSPHAN in tobacco[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and RS2 in corn[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], can all be activated by the induction and protection reaction mechanism of the signaling molecule jasmonic acid, which leads to the over-expression of disease-resistance functional genes, ultimately reducing harm caused by pathogenic bacteria.</p>
      <p>LHY is a 1R protein MYB transcription factor (R1/R2-MYB) that, together with CCA1 (circadian clock associated 1) and TOC1 (timing of cab expression l), forms the central oscillator, the central part of the circadian clock in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The protein amino acid sequence of LHY and CCA1 are high homologous, showing similar circadian rhythms and gene function. Numerous reports have demonstrated that LHY is critical to the function of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> circadian clock, which plays a major and multi-faceted role in the negative feedback loops that drive the rhythmic expression of the clock genes[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The LHY promoter is targeted for regulation by other components of the clock oscillator, as well as being regulated by light[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Many studies have focused on the function of LHY in the circadian clock in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, although it is not clear whether it is involved in the defense response against pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report our cloning and functional studies of a stripe rust pathogen-infested wheat MYB transcription factor that, after bioinformatics analysis, was confirmed to be <italic>TaLHY</italic>. Through the specific expression, circadian rhythm, and expression mechanism of <italic>TaLHY</italic> when it was induced by stripe rust pathogen and hormone, we observed the related influences of <italic>TaLHY</italic> to wheat after VIGS silencing, and assessed the important function of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in the growth and development and the disease-resistant mechanism of wheat.</p>

        <p>Two wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) cultivars (Chuannong19 and Mianyang11) and stripe rust Pst pathotype CYR32 were the biological materials used in this study. Chuannong19, which possesses the stripe rust resistance gene <italic>Yr41</italic>, is nearly resistant to CYR32 in different growth stages except the seedling stage[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while Mianyang11 is susceptible to CYR32. After the two varieties grew to the stem elongation stage under conditions of 14 h light/10 h darkness (22&#xB0;C/10&#xB0;C), the stripe rust pathogen CYR32 and talc powder were mixed and inoculated onto wheat leaf. The inoculated leaves were sampled at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post inoculation(hpi), quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80&#xB0;C prior to total RNA extraction. For hormone treatments, wheat seedlings were sprayed with 100 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 100 mM ethylene (ET), 100 mMabscisic acid (ABA) and 100 mM salicylic acid (SA), following Zhang&#x2019;s method[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The leaves were collected for RNA extraction at 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12 h after hormone treatments. In order to invest the circadian rhythms of the expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic>, we chosen the elongation stage of Chuannong 19 and collected the leaves every two hours in one day to extract RNA for Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Each treatment was performed with three independent biological replicates.</p>

        <p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. DNase I treatment was applied to remove contaminated genomic DNA. Reverse transcriptase (TAKaRa) was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA according to the manual. qRT-PCR was performed, and SYBR Green I Master Mix (TaKaRa, Japan) was used in a volume of 25 &#x3BC;l with the primers (5&#x2019;-CCTACTGCTTCCTTTCCCACAAC-3&#x2019; and 5&#x2019;-CTCTCCTTTTCCACTCTCGTCTG-3&#x2019;) and a CFX96 RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were set up with the following thermal profile: 1 cycle at 95&#xB0;C for 10 s, 45 cycles at 95&#xB0;C for 10 s, 55&#xB0;C for 20 s, and 68&#xB0;C for 15 s, followed by 1 cycle at 95&#xB0;C for 1 min and finally 60&#xB0;C for 1 min.

        <p>Extracts from the Chuannong19 leaves with the cDNA of the cloned <italic>TaLHY</italic> were inoculated with stripe rust pathogen for three days. The SMARTTM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit was used to synthesize 3&#x2019;-RACE cDNA (primers: 5&#x2019;-TGTGGTTCCAACACGCCATCAAGTAGTG-3&#x2019;) and 5&#x2019;-RACE cDNA (primers: 5&#x2019;-CTGGTGGGTGTTTCAGAACTGAGACAAC-3&#x2019;). The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pMD-19T Vector (TaKaRa, Japan) to form positive clones. At least five positive clones were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3130XL Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

        <p>From the SSH cDNA library of the stripe rust pathogen-induced wheat Chuannong19, we selected the EST sequence whose functional annotation is the MYB transcription factor as the designing primer, and used the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method to clone a new wheat MYB transcription factor gene. Sequence analysis indicated that this gene included a complete 1,947-bp open-reading frame (ORF) that encodes a putative protein composed of 648 amino acids with a predicted theoretical molecular weight of 23.13 kDa and an isoeletric point (pI) of 6.34 kDa. Of these 648 amino acids, a 23- to 72-amino acid sequence represented a typical MYB-DNA binding domain. (<xref rid="pone.0127723.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). BLAST analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence of this gene was highly similar to those of predicted LHY-like proteins from <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (GenBank accession NO. XM_003573421.1) (83% identity) and <italic>Setar iaitalica</italic> (GenBank accession NO. XM_004972742.1)(79% identity). Thus, we designated the gene as <italic>TaLHY</italic> (GenBank accession NO: HQ222606.1).</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed the homology relationship among <italic>TaLHY</italic> and related LHY genes in other plant species. Five LHY sequences of monocotyledon plant species and 8 LHY sequences of dicotyledon plant species were downloaded from GenBank to construct a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree with <italic>TaLHY</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0127723.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The results suggested that the LHY genes of 6 monocotyledon plant species formed a conservative independent branch, among which <italic>TaLHY</italic> had the closest homology to <italic>HvLHY</italic>. However, the LHY genes of 8 dicotyledon plant species showed a more complicated homology relationship. Additionally, the result of multiple alignment demonstrated that the MYB-DNA binding domain of LHY in different plants are conserved (<xref rid="pone.0127723.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Among the 50 amino acids length of MYB-DNA binding domain in 11 different plants, 45 amino acids are consistent. <xref rid="pone.0127723.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> showed that the functional domains of TaLHY and other LHY family gene are highly conserved in monocots and dicots.</p>

        <title>Tissue-specific expression and circadian rhythm of <italic>TaLHY</italic></title>
        <p>The relative expression value was measured in different tissues in wheat Chuannong19 using qRT-PCR. The results revealed that the expression levels of <italic>TaLHY</italic> were different between root and other tissues.

        <p>In order to analyze the expression pattern of <italic>TaLHY</italic> induced by CYR32, the leaves of disease-resistant wheat Chuannong19 and susceptible wheat Mianyang11 were inoculated with the stripe rust pathogen race CYR32, respectively. Quantitative fluorescence PCR was used to measure the relative expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post inoculation (hpi). The result showed that, at 24 and 48 hpi, the relative expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in wheat Mianyang11 was slightly up-regulated, and peaked obviously at 72 hpi (<xref rid="pone.0127723.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>).

        <p>As pathogenic bacteria infestation can induce <italic>TaLHY</italic> to express, we further investigate <italic>TaLHY</italic>&#x2019;s response to signaling molecules, including 4 different exogenous hormones. Abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethanol (ET), were selected to treat the leaves of wheat Chuannong19 and wheat Mianyang11 during the jointing stage, and the relative expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in the leaves were measured at 5 time points: 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12 hours post treatment (hpt) (Fig <xref rid="pone.0127723.g005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127723.g005" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Due to the transcript of <italic>TaLHY</italic> having an obvious circadian rhythm, to precisely reflect the response of <italic>TaLHY</italic> to induction by these exogenous hormones, we normalized the level of the <italic>TaLHY</italic> transcript at each time point. After treatment with ABA, the <italic>TaLHY</italic> expression level in Chuannong19 at 1 hpi reached a peak that was significant (p&lt;0.05), but the relative expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in Mianyang11 treated with ABA was almost not changed. At 1 hpi after treatment with SA, the relative expression levels of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in Chuannong19 and Mianyang11 both reached their peaks and were 7-fold and 4-fold of the expression at 0 hpi, respectively, and the expression was much higher than Chuannong19 and Mianyang11 were treated with other hormones at this time point, with the relative expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in Chuannong19 being much higher than that in Mianyang11 (P&lt;0.01). After treatment with JA and ET, the relative expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in Chuannong19 was up-regulated, and peaked at 1 hpi, which was 2-fold higher than that at 0 hpi.

        <title>Down-regulating the expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> affects the growth of wheat and resistance to the stripe rust pathogen</title>
        <p>To study the regulation effects of <italic>TaLHY</italic> on wheat growth and disease resistance, Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) technology was used in wheat Chuannong19 to knock down <italic>TaLHY</italic>. The silencing vector BSMV:PDS was constructed to contain a 159-bp fragment of <italic>TaLHY</italic>. In addition, the buffer and recombination vectors BSMV: &#x3B3;&#x3001;BSMV:PDS and BSMV:GFP used for inoculation in the assay were used as a reference in the study to verify the results of virus infestation. 10 days after virus-activated RNA inoculation of the leaves of all wheat Chuannong19 during the jointing stage, the wheat treated with BSMV:PDS, other the recombined viruses, and buffer (Mock) showed photobleaching, virus spots, and a normal phenotype, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0127723.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). Using qRT-PCR to test the expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> and PDS in the <italic>TaLHY</italic>-silenced plant, we discovered that the relative expression levels of the corresponding silencing genes were 15, 22, 29, and 36 dpi, which were significantly lower (P &lt;0.01) than the weight before they were transferred, indicating that genes were silenced (<xref rid="pone.0127723.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The stripe rust pathogen infestation assay revealed that Mock and BSMV:&#x3B3; and BSMV:GFP-treated plants can resist to CYR32. Many stripe rust pathogen soruses grown on the leaves of Chuannong 19 when treated with BSMV:<italic>TaLHY</italic>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this assay, we identified and cloned a MYB transcription factor called <italic>TaLHY</italic>. <italic>TaLHY</italic> has a 3085-bp-long cDNA. By analyzing the amino acid sequence, it was confirmed that there is a highly conservative MYB-DNA binding domain in <italic>TaLHY</italic>, which is an important structure that facilitates the performance of the <italic>TaLHY</italic> gene as a transcription factor. Because of numerous MYB transcription factors and their complex evolutionary relationships, we only selected LHYs from 13 other plant species to analyze the evolutionary relationships between them and <italic>TaLHY</italic>. It was shown that <italic>TaLHY</italic> has a relatively high homology with the LHY protein in monocotyledon plants such as barley, <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> and wheat. Howere, a difference was noted with dicotyledon plants, which indicated that LHY has different adaptive selections between monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants during evolution. Regarding the evolution model of MYB transcription factors, it is generally recognized that 3R-MYB lacks the 1R sequence and results in 2R-MYB[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], or 2R-MYB gains the 1R sequence and forms 3R-MYB[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The homology analysis indicates that the evolution process of 1R-MYB itself is diversified and complex.</p>
      <p><italic>TaLHY</italic> has a relatively high expression in the leaf, ear and stem of the wheat resulting from its regulation function in the growth and development of the plant. A large number of reports focusing on the LHY of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have shown that LHY not only demonstrates obvious circadian rhythm but restrains and regulates the flowering of the plant together with CCA1, synergistically[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, over-expression of LHY can also destroy the biological clock rhythm of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The assay revealed that the expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> is influenced by light, indicating that it may accumulates at dawn, peaks in the morning, and maintains a very low expression level at night. When <italic>TaLHY</italic> is being down-regulated, the flowering of wheat becomes influenced and cannot enter the heading stage. This article identifies that the regulation of circadian rhythm and plant growth and development by <italic>TaLHY</italic> gene of the monocotyledon wheat is similar to the function of the <italic>LHY</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Moreover, LHY in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as an upstream regulating factor, shows that the physiological regulation of the plant&#x2019;s circadian rhythm, flowering, and so on is a very complex process and is also regulated by a series genes such as ELF3 (early flowering 3), PHYA (phytochrome A), PHYB (phytochrome B), GI (gigantea), ZTL (zeitlupe 1), FKF1 (flavin-binding kelch repeat fbox 1) and DET1 (deetiolated 1)[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further research is needed to detail the regulation mechanism of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in the growth and development of wheat.</p>
      <p>Similar to the disease-resistance-related MYB transcription factors that have been discovered previously[<xref rid="pone.0127723.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> is affected by the stripe rust pathogen infestation. However, the stripe rust pathogen infestation can induce the up-regulation of <italic>TaLHY</italic> more obviously in disease-resistant wheat Chuannong19 than that in susceptible wheat Mianyang11, indicating that the effects of pathogenic bacteria infestation on <italic>TaLHY</italic> are varied in disease-resistant and&#x2014;susceptible wheat species. Currently, it has been found that the MYB transcription factor has a certain broad-spectrum effect on disease resistance, but our results cannot ensure that the <italic>TaLHY</italic> gene has a broad-spectrum effect or specificity on disease resistance. However, when <italic>TaLHY</italic> in wheat Chuannong19 is down-regulated, the plant loses its immune capability toward stripe rust pathogen, proving that <italic>TaLHY</italic> indeed plays a key role as a positive regulation factor as an upstream regulation factor in the disease resistance of wheat.</p>
      <p>After pathogenic bacteria infest a plant, hormone-induced plant systemic resistance can result from different treatment pathways, such as following treatment with SA or JA/Et. Our results revealed that the expression of <italic>TaLHY</italic> is closely related to the SA signal transduction pathway; however, regarding the ABA and JA/Et treatment pathways, <italic>TaLHY</italic> expression is obviously varied in disease-resistant and&#x2014;susceptible wheat species, showing that the transduction pathway of the signal molecule of this transcription factor is diversified. Considering the complexity of a plant&#x2019;s systemic regulation network, the precise regulation of the target gene needs the interactions between multiple types of transcription factors and signal molecules. This article only defines the key function of <italic>TaLHY</italic> in wheat growth and development and disease resistance, thus the detailed regulation mechanism still requires further investigation.</p>
