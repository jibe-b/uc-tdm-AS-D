      <abstract>
        <p>CBL-interacting protein kinases are involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses, including salt stress. However, the negative regulating mechanism of this gene family in response to salinity is less reported. In this study, we evaluated the role of TaCIPK25 in regulating salt response in wheat. Under conditions of high salinity, <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression was markedly down-regulated in roots. Overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> resulted in hypersensitivity to Na<sup>+</sup> and superfluous accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in transgenic wheat lines. <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression did not decline in transgenic wheat and remained at an even higher level than that in wild-type wheat controls under high-salinity treatment. Furthermore, transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange was impaired in the root cells of transgenic wheat. These results suggested that TaCIPK25 negatively regulated salt response in wheat. Additionally, yeast-one-hybrid, &#x3B2;-glucuronidase activity and DNA-protein-interaction-enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays showed that the transcription factor TaWRKY9 bound W-box in the <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> promoter region. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays showed concomitantly inverted expression patterns of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> in wheat roots under salt treatment, ABA application and inhibition of endogenous ABA condition. Overall, based on our results, in a salt stress condition, the negative salt response in wheat involved TaCIPK25 with the expression regulated by TaWRKY9.</p>

  <body>
    <p>High soil salinization is one of the conditions that most restrict plant growth and has serious effects on the cultivation of cereal crops worldwide. High concentrations of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) negatively affect cellular metabolism and cause toxicity to plants. Therefore, emergency mechanisms must be initiated in plants to maintain low levels of Na<sup>+</sup> under salt stress. The mechanism for Na<sup>+</sup> tolerance depends on ion channels or carrier type transporters, particularly the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters localized in either the tonoplast or plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. AtNHX1 was first identified as a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter in the vacuole membrane with five additional Arabidopsis AtNHXs characterized as homologs of AtNHX1 in subsequent studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. With the overexpression of <italic>AtNHX1</italic>, salt tolerance in Arabidopsis increases significantly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, supported by T-DNA insertion of <italic>nhx1</italic> into Arabidopsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In recent years, according to many additional publications, the NHX channel has potassium-proton exchange activity in addition to Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange in tonoplast vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Indeed, the role of vacuolar NHX channels in tolerance to salinity is apparently predominantly to maintain intracellular K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis rather than to transport Na<sup>+</sup> into a vacuole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>For salt tolerance, the role of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the plasma membrane has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis, soybean, wheat and rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The salt overly-sensitive (SOS) pathway related to calcineurin B-like protein (CBL)/CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) network is well characterized as a representative Na<sup>+</sup> efflux mechanism at the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis. To increase salt tolerance in plants, SOS3 (CBL4) protein interacts and recruits SOS2 (CIPK24) to the cytoplasmic membrane in which it activates the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> (SOS1) antiporter by phosphorylation of the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Moreover, CBL/CIPK perceive cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals resulting from salt stress and have important roles in regulating salt stress response and ion homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
    <p>In previous studies, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters were activated haphazardly to determine the mechanism for the improved salt tolerance phenotype in transgenic plants with CBL/CIPK overexpressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, the impaired salt tolerance of CBL/CIPK transgenic lines related to Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis was not reported. Abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and -independent pathways, several transcription factors and promoter elements have also been identified in salt-stress signaling of plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, the detailed regulation of <italic>CIPK</italic>s in these signaling pathways is less characterized. In a previous study, we isolated a wheat <italic>CIPK</italic>, i.e., <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> (homology to AtCIPK12, 18 and 19)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In this study, based on our results, the overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> impaired salt tolerance, which was mediated by a WRKY transcription factor in an ABA-dependent pathway under saline conditions.</p>

        <title>Expression patterns of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in response to salt and ABA application</title>
        <p>To analyze the expression patterns of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic>, the relative expression levels of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in different wheat tissues were detected using fluorescent quantitative analysis (qRT-PCR). <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> was expressed in all assayed tissues, including coleoptile, root, stem, leaf, pistil and stamens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To determine whether TaCIPK25 plays role in responses to abiotic stresses in wheat, the expression patterns of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in seedling roots and leaves were detected under ABA (100&#x2009;&#x3BC;M) and NaCl (200&#x2009;mM) treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The expression level of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in leaves initially decreased slightly, then was up-regulated at 6 h and increased to peak levels of expression under ABA and NaCl treatments. For gene expression in roots, expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> decreased rapidly in 1&#x2009;h and then decreased consistently to the lowest level of expression at 24&#x2009;h in both NaCl and ABA treatments.</p>
        <p>ABA is a well-known signal molecule in abiotic stress responses and regulates many stress-responsive genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. To explore whether the expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in response to NaCl was related to the ABA-dependent pathway, we used fluridone to inhibit endogenous ABA biosynthesis. Under high salt treatment, the down-regulation of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression was impaired in fluridone pretreated seedling roots compared with untreated seedling roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Based on these results, TaCIPK25 down-regulated expressions induced by NaCl were involved in ABA signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>TaWRKY9 binding to the promoter region of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic></title>
        <p><italic>Cis</italic>-elements play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression. Therefore, we isolated the 1,000-bp upstream sequence from the start codon of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> and searched for putative elements using PLACE. We identified many putative <italic>cis</italic>-elements, including five putative WRKY transcription factor-binding sites (W1&#x2013;W5; W-box core sequence, TGAC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). WRKY transcription factors are both positive and negative regulators of ABA signaling and rapidly activate gene expression in plant defense processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In a previous study, we demonstrated that TaWRKYs were involved in improving stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>; therefore, we selected three representative TaWRKY transcription factors (TaWRKY1, TaWRKY9 and TaWRKY44) to verify the interactions with promoters of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic>.</p>
        <p>In a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay, yeast cells transformed with three combinations (TaWRKY9-W4, TaWRKY9-W5, and TaWRKY44-W5) of TaWRKYs, and PHIS2-W-boxes grew well on the selective media (50&#x2013;100&#x2009;mM 3-AT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), which was an indication that TaWRKY9 and TaWRKY44 physically interacted with the promoter of <italic>TaCIPK25.</italic> In our previous study using the Y1H method (positive control), TaWRKY44 interacted with the typical TTGACC element<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, but this type of element was not found in the promoter region of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic>. No interaction between TaWRKY1 and W-boxes was detected in this analysis. Additionally, we used DPI-ELISA to further confirm these interactions; however, we did not analyze TaWRKY44 in this assay because we could not purify the recombinant protein effectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, TaWRKY1 gave a significant light absorption signal with the W1&#x2013;W5 boxes, whereas TaWRKY9 had a strong signal only with the W5 element. Therefore, specific binding between TaWRKY9 and the W5 element was verified by both Y1H and DPI-ELISA methods. Notably, DPI-ELISA assay results were not completely consistent with those of the Y1H method, particularly for TaWRKY1. These differences might be related to the difference in protein purification method (purification in a prokaryotic expression system) with DPI-ELISA. We selected <italic>Gus</italic> gene as a reporter driven by the <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> promoter and transiently expressed the promoter-<italic>Gus</italic> construct in transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing <italic>TaWRKY1, TaWRKY9</italic>, and <italic>TaWRKY44</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, the relative Gus activities in the <italic>TaWRKY1</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY44</italic> transgenic lines had no significant differences compared with control lines. However, the relative Gus activity in <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> transgenic lines decreased compared with control lines, which again confirmed that TaWRKY9 acted on the promoter region of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> by binding the W5 element and down-regulating the expression.</p>

        <title>Expression patterns of <italic>TaWRKYs</italic> in response to NaCl and ABA treatments</title>
        <p>To confirm the correlations of expression profiles between <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> and <italic>TaWRKYs (TaWRKY1, 9</italic> and <italic>44</italic>), the expression of <italic>TaWRKY</italic>s was also determined by qRT-PCR in wheat. Under ABA and NaCl treatments, <italic>TaWRKY1</italic> and <italic>TaWRKY44</italic> were up-regulated in leaves and down-regulated in roots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> was rapidly up-regulated and reached peak levels in 1&#x2009;h in leaves and roots of wheat plants following ABA or NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Notably, the expression patterns of <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> were in contrast to those of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Whereas the transcript levels of <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> rapidly accumulated in 1&#x2009;h after treatment with NaCl and ABA, expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> was down-regulated, particularly in roots. However, in saline conditions, expression patterns of <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> were inverted, when endogenous ABA was inhibited by fluridone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Based on these results, TaWRKY9 was a candidate transcription factor for the negative regulation of the expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> by the ABA-dependent pathway under salt stress.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> decreased salt tolerance and affected Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in Arabidopsis</title>
        <p>Considering the low success rate of obtaining positive transgenic wheat for transformed genes, we first confirmed the salt tolerance performance in a model plant species. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> driven by CaMV 35S promoter were generated. Among these transgenic lines, OE7, OE17 and OE23 were randomly selected for further analysis. Overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in Arabidopsis was verified by RT-PCR; the three lines had different levels of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). For the salt tolerance assay, four-leaf stage, MS-germinated seedlings were transferred to MS medium or MS medium supplied with 150&#x2009;mM NaCl. After 20&#x2009;d, the growth phenotype of the transgenic lines was weaker than that of WT and vector control (VC) plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). For further analysis, 10-day-old seedlings of WT, VC and transgenic lines grown in soil were irrigated with 200&#x2009;mM NaCl at 5-day intervals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, the difference in growth status of transgenic lines and control plants began to appear 10&#x2009;d after NaCl treatment. With an increase in time, leaf death was greater in transgenic lines than that in control plants. These results suggested that the tolerance of transgenic lines was impaired by overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in Arabidopsis.</p>
        <p>Anti-oxidative systems are typically used to determine the salt tolerance of plants subjected to salt stress. In this study, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content of transgenic lines was higher than those of controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> was induced when wheat plants were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. To explore whether <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> participated in oxidative stress, the transgenic and control plants were treated with methyl viologen (causing oxidative damage); no obvious difference in the growth of plants between transgenic and control lines was observed within 20&#x2009;d of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These data suggested that the peroxides caused by salt stress were not responsible for the excessively withered leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis under a saline condition; thus, TaCIPK25 did not improve the tolerance of Arabidopsis to oxidative damage.</p>
        <p>The phenotype with impaired salt tolerance of transgenic lines might be explained by the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>. To determine whether this assumption was valid, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> content in leaves of the transgenic lines and control plants was measured following salt treatment. Based on the results, the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> was higher in transgenic plants than that in controls, whereas the content of K<sup>+</sup> was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, the overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> resulted in a greater accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in transgenic Arabidopsis.</p>

        <title>Generation of transgenic wheat with overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic></title>
        <p>The ectopic expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in Arabidopsis provided a preliminary view of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> function, whereas the actual role of TaCIPK25 depends on performance in wheat. Therefore, the CDS of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> was constructed into an overexpression vector (OV-TaCIPK25) driven by the maize <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promoter. To detect transcripts of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> derived from OV-TaCIPK25, specific primers were added to bilateral sites of the insertion gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The OV-TaCIPK25 DNA was bombarded into wheat (Chinese spring cultivar) immature embryos to generate <italic>TaCIPK25</italic>-overexpressing transgenic wheat plants. Five positive transgenic T<sub>0</sub> plants were identified by PCR with transgene-specific primers, and PCR products were sequenced to confirm the validity. When the transgenic lines were proliferated to T<sub>2</sub> progenies, two stable transgenic lines, OE40-2 and OE40-3, were obtained with transcripts of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> (derived from OV-TaCIPK25) detected in both lines by PCR assay. We found expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in root and leaf tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Based on qRT-PCR results, the <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> transgenic lines had much higher levels of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression than that of the wild type under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Notably, the transcript levels of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in transgenic lines did not decrease following treatment with 150&#x2009;mM NaCl, which suggested that these two transgenic wheat lines could be used in further analyses.</p>

        <p>To evaluate the effect of TaCIPK25 on salinity tolerance in wheat, wild type and transgenic lines were germinated and grown in MS liquid medium, and then 10-day-old seedlings were transferred to MS liquid medium containing 150&#x2009;mM NaCl. Transgenic wheat plants withered on MS liquid medium containing 150&#x2009;mM NaCl after 24&#x2009;h treatment and were almost dead after 96&#x2009;h, whereas WT plants grew normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Based on these results, the overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> significantly impaired salt tolerance in wheat. Twenty-four hours after salt treatment, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> content in roots and leaves of wild type and transgenic seedlings was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>, the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in the roots and leaves of the transgenic lines increased compared with that in those of wild-type controls (the K<sup>+</sup> content was not significantly different). These results were similar to those observed in transgenic Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>); thus, the excess accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> was an indication of impaired salt tolerance in transgenic wheat.</p>

        <title>TaCIPK25 specific regulation of Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in wheat</title>
        <p>The sodium transport mechanism in plants primarily includes Na<sup>+</sup> specific channels and nonselective cation channel pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, whether the higher Na<sup>+</sup> content in transgenic lines was related to Na<sup>+</sup> specific channels or to nonselective cation channels must be determined. In transgenic Arabidopsis and wheat overexpressing <italic>TaCIPK25</italic>, no obvious changes were observed in the K<sup>+</sup> content between transgenic and control lines under salt treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5E</xref>). For further analysis, the transgenic and wild type wheat were treated with 150&#x2009;mM KCl for 24&#x2009;h, and no obvious difference in K<sup>+</sup> content was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). When seedlings were treated with 75&#x2009;mM NaCl and 75&#x2009;mM KCl, transgenic lines accumulated more Na<sup>+</sup> than that in the wild type, but no significant changes occurred in K<sup>+</sup> content. Under normal conditions (MS-treated), the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> content in transgenic and wild type seedlings was not different.</p>
        <p>In a previous study, the wheat gene <italic>TaLCT1</italic>, a low affinity cation transporter, generated hypersensitivity to Na<sup>+</sup> in yeast and mediated the uptake of Na<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+&#x2009;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In this study, 24&#x2009;h after treatment with 150&#x2009;mM CsCl or 150&#x2009;mM LiCl, the transgenic lines overexpressing <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> did not accumulate more Cs<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> than wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B,C</xref>). However, the addition of 75&#x2009;mM NaCl with 75&#x2009;mM CsCl restrained the TaCIPK25-induced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation, and Na<sup>+</sup> did not affect the accumulation of Cs<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Additionally, transgenic lines that overexpressed <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> accumulated more Li<sup>+</sup> only when NaCl was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating a likely Na<sup>+</sup>-induced Li<sup>+</sup> accumulation pathway. In general, based on these results, Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis regulated by TaCIPK25 in transgenic wheat lines did not involve nonselective cation channel pathways.</p>

        <title>TaCIPK25 involvement in regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanges</title>
        <p>In a previous study using the yeast two-hybrid method, we found that TaCIPK25 interacted with TaCBL1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. To further confirm this interaction and determine the localization, TaCBL1 and TaCIPK25 were respectively constructed to the C- and N-terminals of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) for a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and to GFP fusion constructs for intracellular locations. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, TaCBL1 was primarily localized at the cell membrane and TaCIPK25 was distributed ubiquitously within the cell. Notably, yellow fluorescent signal was observed at the cell membrane in the BiFC analysis, which indicated the interaction between TaCBL1 and TaCIPK25 in plant cells and a potential functional site.</p>
        <p>To explore whether co-localization of TaCBL1 and TaCIPK25 indicated a potential functional site for ion flux regulation at the cell membrane, we measured the transmembrane ion fluxes noninvasively using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET). For the measurement of Na<sup>+</sup> efflux, wheat plants were pretreated with 50&#x2009;mM NaCl for 3&#x2009;h and then transferred to measure buffer for Na<sup>+</sup> flux measurements. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>, the net immediate Na<sup>+</sup> efflux was lower in transgenic lines than that in control seedlings with NaCl treatment; therefore, overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in wheat likely decreased Na<sup>+</sup> efflux from cells. For net H<sup>+</sup> efflux, we found no significant differences between WT and transgenic wheat lines, when wheat plants were put into measuring buffer. However, the H<sup>+</sup> effluxes of the wild type were significantly more impaired than those of transgenic wheat lines after the addition of 50&#x2009;mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>), which indicated lower H<sup>+</sup> influxes in transgenic wheat lines. Thus, based on these results, TaCIPK25 was likely involved in regulating Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>High soil salinity is one of the factors that most restricts plant growth and development, and plants have developed many mechanisms to cope with salt stress. An intriguing question is how this salinity response mechanism is initiated and then transmitted to downstream functional proteins when plants are exposed to a saline environment. ABA is an important signal molecule that plants use to respond to abiotic stress, which also regulates many stress-responsive genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. WRKY transcription factors are both positive and negative regulators of ABA signaling and rapidly activate gene expression in plant defensive processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In this study, we found interactions among ABA, WRKY and CIPK in the regulation of ABA pathways. Expression levels of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> were regulated by ABA and high salinity, and when endogenous ABA was inhibited by fluridone, expression recovered in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), which indicated expression was regulated by an ABA-dependent pathway. Notably, the expression patterns of <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> were in contrast to those of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> under salinity and ABA application with levels of expression also affected by eliminating endogenous ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We showed that TaWRKY9 bound directly to the promoter of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> and negatively regulated the expression levels of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, TaWRKY9 likely negatively regulated the expression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> through an ABA-dependent pathway under salt stress.</p>
      <p>To explore the effects on wheat plants caused by the regulation of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression by TaWRKY9 under salt treatment, transgenic Arabidopsis and wheat plants were generated that overexpressed <italic>TaCIPK25</italic>. In early studies, overexpression of <italic>CIPK</italic>s increased salt tolerance in many plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In this study, overexpression of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> in Arabidopsis and wheat had negative effects on salt tolerance with overexpression in transgenic lines leading to the accumulation of more Na<sup>+</sup> than that in wild-type controls, which indicated a different mechanism for involvement of CIPK in the response to salt stress. At the cellular level, Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in plants primarily occurs through two distinct processes, Na<sup>+</sup> influx and efflux. For Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, many nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) are identified as Na<sup>+</sup> permeable channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, which also have other cation transportation capabilities. For example, TaLCT1 is a low-affinity cation transporter that mediates the uptake of Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup>, and the uptake of Na<sup>+</sup> through LCT was inhibited by K<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> in yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our results showed that transgenic wheat lines overexpressing <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> specifically accumulated Na<sup>+</sup>, whereas the transport of Li<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> was unaffected. Moreover, neither Li<sup>+</sup> nor K<sup>+</sup> inhibited Na<sup>+</sup> uptake in these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). For Cs<sup>+</sup>, the addition of CsCl eliminated the difference in Na<sup>+</sup> content between control and transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>), implying a potential function related to TaLCT1 or other ion homeostasis mechanism. However, no significant differences in Cs<sup>+</sup> content between control and transgenic lines were observed under the 150&#x2009;mM CsCl treatment. Therefore, based on current data, TaCIPK25 was apparently not involved in the regulation of TaLCT1 or other NSCCs. In other studies, the durum wheat SOS1 and Arabidopsis NHX8 (SOS) proteins efficiently mediated not only Na<sup>+</sup> efflux but also Li<sup>+</sup> efflux<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Notably, transgenic wheat overexpressing <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> accumulated Li<sup>+</sup> through a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>), and low levels of Na<sup>+</sup> effluxes and H<sup>+</sup> influxes were observed in the <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> overexpressed wheat lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), which suggested a plausible relationship between TaCIPK25 and SOS pathways with different roles in regulating the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter. However, based on the current data, we cannot conclude that TaCIPK25 participated in negative regulation of the SOS pathway. Nevertheless, specific Na<sup>+</sup> transportation was a reasonable explanation for the TaCIPK25-induced salt sensitive phenotype, which also provided a clue for the exploration of potential target proteins of TaCIPK25 in future work.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study provides insights into the mechanisms of gene expression regulation and salt response of TaCIPK25 in wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Under nonsaline conditions, <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> is persistently expressed in wheat roots and might be involved in uptake of nutritional Na<sup>+</sup>. When plants encounter high-salinity stress, ABA, as an important signal molecule, regulates expression of many stress-responsive genes, including <italic>TaWRKY9</italic>. The ABA-dependent pathway to induce the transcription factor gene <italic>TaWRKY9</italic> which represses <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> expression in wheat roots rapidly induced and further affected Na<sup>+</sup> transportation. The sensitive phenotypic characteristics that were observed in transgenic wheat were closely related to the expression levels of <italic>TaCIPK25,</italic> which did not decline and even maintained a higher level of expression than that of wild-type wheat controls under the high salinity treatment. Therefore, the down-regulation of <italic>TaCIPK25</italic> mediated by TaWRKY9 is a protection mechanism to cope with high salinity environments in wheat, which also provides useful information for the genetic manipulation of wheat to improve salt tolerance. Studies are also underway to examine specific Na<sup>+</sup> channels that directly interact with TaCIPK25 protein with the aim to better understand the involvement of TaCIPK25 in the salt response pathway.</p>
