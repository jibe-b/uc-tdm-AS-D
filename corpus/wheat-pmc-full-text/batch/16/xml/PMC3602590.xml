      <abstract>
        <p>To search for genes involved in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) defense response to the infection of stripe rust pathogen <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), we identified and cloned a new wheat gene similar to the genes in the Abc1-like gene family. The new gene, designated as <italic>TaAbc1</italic>, encodes a 717-amino acid, 80.35 kD protein. The TaAbc1 protein contains two conserved domains shared by Abc1-like proteins, two trans-membrane domains at the C-terminal, and a 36-amino acid chloroplast targeting presequence at the N-terminal. Characterization of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> expression revealed that gene expression was tissue-specific and could be up-regulated by biotic agents (e.g., stripe rust pathogen) and/or by an abiotic stress like wounding. High-fold induction was associated with the hypersensitive response (HR) triggered only by avirulent stripe rust pathotypes, suggesting that <italic>TaAbc1</italic> is a rust-pathotype specific HR-mediator. Down-regulating <italic>TaAbc1</italic> reduced HR but not the overall resistance level in Suwon11 to CYR23, suggesting <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was involved in HR against stripe rust, but overall host resistance is not HR-dependent.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plant hypersensitive response (HR), visualized as rapid death of host plant cells at the infection sites, is a means of plant defense response to microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Stakman1">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Shirasu1">[4]</xref>. This process is under intrinsic fine genetic control similar to the programmed cell death (PCD) in animal cells. In mammals, PCD is defined as apoptosis, a complex physiological process that removes unwanted or harmful cells from a body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Geske1">[5]</xref>. In plants, HR is triggered by incompatible interactions of host plants and corresponding pathogens. Plant HR may deplete nutrient supply and effectively restrict pathogen growth, especially for biotrophs that only survive and reproduce on living cells. Accompanying rapid cell death, a set of defense responses including cell wall reinforcement, accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates, antimicrobial compounds and pathogenesis-related proteins is also observed.</p>
      <p>Decades of studies in animal and plant systems have revealed that mitochondria play an important role in integrating cell-death signals in regulating PCD and HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Lam1">[6]</xref>. Several genes associated with the death signal pathway through mitochondria have been isolated and characterized. Among those genes, <italic>CABC1</italic>, a human mitochondrial gene that is highly similar to the yeast nuclear gene <italic>Abc1</italic> (for Activity of bc1 complex), has been shown to play an important role in the p53-induced apoptotic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Iiizumi1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The first <italic>Abc1</italic> gene was cloned and characterized in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and was shown to suppress the cytochrome b mRNA translation defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Bousquet1">[8]</xref>. Up to now, <italic>Abc1</italic>-like genes have been identified in nuclei mitochondria and chloroplasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Iiizumi1">[7]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Jasinski1">[9]</xref> and have been shown to fulfill diverse functions. The yeast <italic>Abc1</italic> gene was located in the nucleus but has a dual function in mitochondria; it controls the correct folding of cytochrome b and the assembly of bc1 complex in the mitochondrial respiration chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Brasseur1">[10]</xref>. <italic>Abc1</italic> was lately found to be necessary for yeast coenzyme Q synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Poon1">[11]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Hsieh1">[12]</xref>. The <italic>Abc1</italic>-like gene family has also been described as a new family of putative protein kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Leonard1">[13]</xref>. A plant <italic>Abc1</italic>-like gene, the <italic>Arabidopsis AtOSA1</italic> gene, located in chloroplasts, was found to be involved in balancing oxidative stress generated by Cd<sup>2+</sup>, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Jasinski1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we were searching for genes involved in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) defense response to the stripe rust pathogen <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>). This fungal pathogen can cause wheat stripe rust disease, and is a worldwide problem threatening wheat production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Chen1">[14]</xref>. We isolated a wheat gene that shares the common features of <italic>Abc1</italic>-like genes. Here, we present the results on molecular characteristics of this newly identified wheat <italic>Abc1</italic>-like gene, its expression profiles in response to <italic>Pst</italic> infection and abiotic elicitors and its involvement in wheat defense response to a group of rust fungal pathogens.</p>

        <p>From a cDNA library constructed from the wheat cultivar Suwon11 infected with a virulent <italic>Pst</italic> pathotype CYR31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Ma1">[15]</xref>, we selected an EST clone for further characterization in this study due to its strong up-regulated expression in the incompatible interaction of Suwon 11 infected with <italic>Pst</italic> pathotype CYR23. The clone contains a 597-bp cDNA fragment that is highly homologous to the <italic>Abc1</italic> (for activity of bc1 complex) like gene family in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) (GenBank accession no. AK120335.1). After database mining, we obtained a 2,675-bp wheat sequence <italic>in silico</italic>. The sequence was highly homologous to a cDNA clone (J013059I22) from <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> Japonica. To verify the gene sequence in wheat, a pair of primers TaAbc1-Fp/Rp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058969-t001">Table 1</xref>) was designed and used to amplify the candidate gene from wheat mRNA. A 2,550-bp cDNA sequence was successfully amplified from Suwon11. The sequence includes a 2,154-bp open reading frame (ORF), a 123-bp 5&#x2032;-untranslated region (UTR), and a 173-bp 3&#x2032;-UTR predicted using the DNASTAR software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dnastar.com">www.dnastar.com</ext-link>). The encoded protein shares an 87% similarity to the Abc1-like protein of <italic>O. sativa</italic> (GenBank accession: BAD22484.1). We designated the wheat gene as <italic>TaAbc1</italic> (GenBank accession: JX944037).</p>

        <p>The TaAbc1 protein was predicted to have 717 amino acids, a molecular weight of 80.35 kD and an isoelectric point (pI value) of 9.38. The protein includes two conserved domains shared by Abc1-like proteins, two trans-membrane domains located between positions 659&#x2013;679 and 685&#x2013;703, and a 36-amino acid N-terminal chloroplast targeting presequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The two conserved domains are the domain of 121-amino acids from the region of 267&#x2013;387 that shares the characteristics of Abc1-like proteins; and the other of 321-amino acids of a putative kinase domain from the region of 276&#x2013;596.</p>

Normalizing the level of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundances in leaves as 1, stems had about 50% higher level than that in leaves.

        <p>To study the expression profiles of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> during the course of rust infections in both incompatible and compatible interactions, we challenged Suwon11 with two <italic>Pst</italic> pathotypes, CYR23 and CYR31. Suwon11 was resistant to CYR23, and susceptible to CYR31, therefore, Suwon11/CYR23 represented an incompatible interaction, and Suwon11/CYR31 a compatible interaction. In addition, we included in the study two additional incompatible interactions with a USA spring wheat genotype Scholar with a leaf rust resistance gene <italic>Lr47</italic>, inoculated with pathotype PBJL of the leaf rust pathogen (<italic>P. triticina</italic>) and pathotype QFCSC of the stem rust pathogen (<italic>P. graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>). <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundances were measured in the leaf tissues collected at 5 time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) challenged with different rust species and pathotypes in two different wheat cultivars. In both incompatible and compatible interactions, the relative expression of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was up-regulated and peaked at 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) and declined at 48 hpi. The transcripts remained at higher levels than each of their corresponding 0-hpi-controls at 72 hpi in Suwon11 challenged with both stripe rust pathotypes, while the levels in Scholar+<italic>Lr47</italic> were soon back to the control level at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The striking difference was that the up-regulated level of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcripts was much higher (as much as 7-fold) in the incompatible interaction of Suwon11/CYR23, and increased only up to 2-fold in the rest of the interactions by comparison to each of their corresponding controls at 0 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). By 120 hpi, the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> expression level resumed the level of its 0-hpi-control in the incompatible interaction but was still slightly higher than the 0-hpi-control in the compatible interaction. In summary, <italic>TaAbc1</italic> expression increased and decreased dramatically over the course of 120 hours post inoculation in the incompatible interaction of Suwon11/CYR23; whereas, in the rest of interactions, <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was only slightly increased and decreased over the same time period.</p>

        <p>Since <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was up-regulated and peaked at 24 hpi with rust challenge in both incompatible and compatible interactions, we asked the question whether the gene can be induced by a signal molecule. We treated Suwon11 with four different signal molecules including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethanol (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA) at the seedling stage. We collected leaf tissues at 5 different time points up to 24 hours post treatment (hpt) and used 0 hpt as the control for each corresponding treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). We normalized the level of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundances at 0 hpt as 1 for each treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was slightly down-regulated at 2 hpt in all except the JA treatment, and then was lingering around the 0 hpt level up to 12 hpt. At 24 hpt, the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundances were increased about 3-fold only in the leaves treated with JA and ET, but the magnitudes were significantly smaller than those induced by stripe rust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). No significant changes in <italic>TaAbc1</italic> expression occurred with the SA and ABA treatments.</p>

        <p>Rapid induction of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> gene expression was associated with incompatible interaction. To test if <italic>TaAbc1</italic> has any functional role in wheat defense response to stripe rust, we knocked down the endogenous <italic>TaAbc1</italic> gene in Suwon11 using the barley stripe mosaic virus induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) assay. The silencing vector was constructed to contain a 160-bp fragment of <italic>TaAbc1</italic>, designated as BSMV:TaAbc1. As controls, a construct carrying only the BSMV genome, designated as BSMV:00, and a construct carrying a 120-bp wheat phytoene desaturase (<italic>PDS</italic>) gene, designated as BSMV:PDS, were included in the study. In addition, Suwon11 seedlings inoculated with BSMV inoculation buffer were also included as a mock control. Nine days post viral RNA inoculations, plants inoculated with BSMV:PDS started to show photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), indicating BSMV induced gene silencing was initiated. Twenty-four each of the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> silenced plants and control plants were then challenged with each of the two stripe rust pathotypes CYR23 and CYR31. Fungal infection types were assessed at 15 days post rust inoculation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, Suwon11 had a resistant response to CYR23, exhibited with a high density of necrosis resulting from hypersensitive response (HR) on the mock and BSMV:00 control leaves. <italic>TaAbc1</italic> silenced plants showed the same level of resistance to CYR23 as the controls, but the density of necrosis was significantly less than that on the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Meanwhile, none of the treatments changed Suwon11 susceptible response to CYR31, and no detectable difference was observed among BSMV:TaAbc1 treated plants and controls. To make sure the silencing assay was effective, leaf tissues were collected from both BSMV:TaAbc1 and BSMV:00 treated plants inoculated with either CYR23 or CYR31 right after fungal inoculation at 0, 48 and 120 hpi. Real-time PCR revealed that <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundances from all the BSMV:TaAbc1 treated plants were reduced to about 20% to 40% of the relative levels of the BSMV:00 treated control plants at the time of rust inoculation and up to 120 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The results confirmed the silencing of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was effective, and knocking down <italic>TaAbc1</italic> reduced HR in Suwon11, triggered by the avirulent pathotype CYR23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

Fungal development and host responses in CYR31-inoculated plants were similar to what have been described for Suwon11&#x2013;<italic>Pst</italic> compatible interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Wang1">[17]</xref>. We further measured the size of necrotic area per infection site under a microscope. In an incompatible interaction with CYR23, Suwon11 had an average size of 4 mm<sup>2</sup> necrotic area per infection site on the control leaves at 48 hpi, and only about 1.6 mm<sup>2</sup> on the leaves of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> silenced plants, which was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) smaller than the control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058969-t002">Table 2</xref>). At 120 hpi, average sites of necrotic areas became bigger, about 14 mm<sup>2</sup> per infection site on the control, and 8 mm<sup>2</sup> on the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> silenced leaves. However, there was no detectable difference observed by the naked eye in resistance level to CYR23 between the controls and <italic>TaAbc1</italic> silenced plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058969-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

These results suggested that HR had a positive role on restricting fungal infection hyphal growth rates. Knocking down the transcriptional level of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> in Suwon11 reduced the degree of cell death, and in turn, decreased the level of stripe rust resistance during early fungal infection.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We isolated and characterized a new gene involved in wheat resistance to stripe rust pathogen. The gene resembles the structures of a group of <italic>Abc1</italic>-like genes in animals and plants. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are 17 putative <italic>Abc1</italic>-like genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Jasinski1">[9]</xref>. Among them, At3g07700 shares 72% amino acid identity with <italic>TaAbc1</italic>. However, so far, only two <italic>Abc1</italic> representatives have been characterized in plants. One is At4g01660, localized in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Bousquet1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Cardazzo1">[18]</xref>, and is a homolog of the yeast <italic>Abc1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Cardazzo1">[18]</xref>. The encoded protein shares only 28% amino acid identity with TaAbc1.The second one, AtOSA1, shares 46% amino acid identity with TaAbc1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058969.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), and is the first member of <italic>Abc1</italic> family to be localized in the chloroplasts with a function of balancing oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Jasinski1">[9]</xref>. Mutants with T-DNA insertion on <italic>AtOSA1</italic> were more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>TaAbc1</italic> and <italic>AtOSA1</italic> exhibited the same tissue-specific expression patterns that predominantly expressed in leaves and stems, with only a very low level in roots. In addition, both TaAbc1 and AtOSA1 proteins carry an N-terminal chloroplast targeting presequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Jasinski1">[9]</xref>. These results tend to suggest that the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> may locate and execute its function in chloroplasts.</p>
      <p><italic>TaAbc1</italic> plays an important role in stress response. The gene transcript level followed a complex kinetics, with as much as 2.5&#x223C;7-fold induction in response to different stresses, but cell death was only observed on leaves when the induction was as much as 7-fold up-regulated. Our observations imply the existence of a threshold, responding to the combination of stress signals initiated by either a biotic agent (e.g. stripe rust) and/or an abiotic stress like wounding, above which a cell commits itself to suicide. All three rust inoculations which up-regulated the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundances in leaves peaked at 24 hpi. However, 7-fold induction was only seen in the incompatible interaction of Suwon11/CYR23. The expression of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was not affected by SA treatment, suggesting that <italic>TaAbc1</italic> was positioned either up-stream of SA or in an SA-independent manner. Similar levels of 2.5&#x223C;3-fold induction were detected in the compatible interaction of Suwon11/CYR31 as well as the other two incompatible interactions of Scholar+<italic>Lr47</italic>/PBJL and Scholar+<italic>Lr47</italic>/QFCSC, where HR was associated with resistance response. It was tempting to speculate that the 2.5&#x223C;3-fold induction was an induction level responding to the basal defense triggered by a rust fungal molecule pattern. An exogenous treatment of JA/ET up-regulated <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcription but the increase was not as much as that detected in the directly wounded plants. JA and ET are two key signaling molecules during plant defenses against necrotrophic pathogens and insects as well as wounding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Reymond1">[19]</xref>. Induction with exogenous treatment by JA/ET may suggest the involvement of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> in wounding signaling.</p>
      <p>Down-regulating <italic>TaAbc1</italic> reduced HR, elicited by the incompatible interaction between Suwon11 and <italic>Pst</italic> pathotype CYR23. In addition, <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcripts were highly up-regulated by 100 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These observations invited the hypothesis that <italic>TaAbc1</italic> could be a commonly shared cell-death signal used in wheat defense response to rust fungal pathogens. However, the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcript abundance level responding to leaf and stem rust in the two incompatible interactions tested did not support this hypothesis. Our results tend to suggest that <italic>TaAbc1</italic>-mediated HR was rust species and pathotype specific only in the incompatible interactions triggered by stripe rust. It is unclear yet whether all HR seen in incompatible interactions between wheat and stripe rust pathotypes go through <italic>TaAbc1</italic>. With current rather limited observations, we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>TaAbc1-</italic>mediated HR is <italic>R</italic>-gene specific. Microscopic observations did reveal the timing differences of HR triggered by different rusts. HR associated with resistance to stripe rust fungus appeared at 18 hpi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Wang1">[17]</xref>, earlier than observed in resistance to leaf or stem rust pathogens in wheat. In general, HR triggered by leaf or stem rust pathogens appeared at 48 hpi (Huang unpublished data). Conserved mechanisms and mediators regulating cell death have been found in animals and plants, but studies also pointed out multiple signaling pathways and different organelles executing programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Lam1">[6]</xref>. In plants, in addition to mitochondria, the plastid organelles also participate in HR-associated signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Keller1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Torres1">[21]</xref>. It is not surprising to learn that HR induced by different rust pathogens used different mediators located in different organelles.</p>
      <p>Silencing <italic>TaAbc1</italic> reduced HR triggered by Suwon11/CYR23 incompatible interaction. Significantly longer fungal hyphae were observed under a microscope in <italic>TaAbc1</italic> knocked-down plants compared to the controls. However, there were no visible differences in overall stripe rust resistance between the <italic>TaAbc1</italic> silenced plants and the controls. The results suggest that HR is an important but not an essential defense response to stripe rust in wheat. HR reinforces growth arrest of stripe rust pathogen via depletion of nutrient supply, but overall host defense is not HR-dependent. Accumulating results from studies in wheat and other plant systems show that not all <italic>R</italic>-gene-triggered resistance requires cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Shirasu1">[4]</xref>. Potato <italic>Rx</italic>-mediated resistance to potato virus X (PVX) is not associated with HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Bendahmane1">[22]</xref>. Wheat leaf rust resistance gene <italic>Lr34</italic>-mediated resistance has no visible HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Krattinger1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>dnd1</italic> (for defense with no death) mutant expresses resistance when the HR is blocked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Clough1">[24]</xref>. Undoubtedly, plant defense response signaling is not a simple straight line; the networks could be parallel, branching or converging. Although HR is a very common rust pathogen resistant phenotype in wheat, it is not an obligatory reaction. Our study suggested that signaling pathways to HR and other defense responses induced by CYR23 in wheat are branched.</p>
      <p>The function of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> in resistance toward stripe rust was probably related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). <italic>TaAbc1</italic> transcripts were highly up-regulated by exogenous treatment of 100 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>AtOSA1</italic> T-DNA-insertion <italic>atosa1</italic> mutants showed increased sensitivity toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and high light. <italic>AtOSA1</italic> transcript levels were up-regulated in wild type after 1 &#xB5;M cadmium treatment that induced oxidative stress although the mechanism of how the stress is induced by this metal is still obscured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Jasinski1">[9]</xref>. Cd<sup>2+</sup> can inhibit electron transferring in membranes and induces ROS formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Wang2">[25]</xref>. AtOSA1 probably acts as part of a signal transduction pathway to balance oxidative stress. In the incompatible interaction of Suwon11/CYR23, the generation and accumulation of ROS was detected at infection sites and is associated with the occurrence of HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Wang1">[17]</xref>. In conclusion, we infer that <italic>TaAbc1</italic> plays an important role mediating hypersensitive response. However, the mechanism of <italic>TaAbc1</italic> in wheat defense response and the relationship with ROS need to be further investigated.</p>

        <p>Stripe rust inoculations were conducted at Northwest A &amp; F University, China. Leaf and stem rust inoculations were conducted at Plant Growth Center, Montana State University, USA. For stripe rust inoculation, freshly collected urediniospores were applied with a paintbrush to the surface of primary leaves of 7-day-old wheat seedlings. After inoculation, plants were incubated for 24 hours in dark in a 100% humidity dew chamber and were subsequently transferred to a growth chamber with a 16 hour photoperiod. Mock stripe rust control inoculation was carried out with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. For leaf and stem rust inoculations, rust urediniospores were suspended in Soltrol 170 isoparaffin (Chempoint, Bellevue, WA). The mocks were carried out with Soltrol 170.

        <p>For tissue-specific expression analyses of <italic>TaAbc1</italic>, intact root, stem, and leaf tissues of 2-week-old wheat seedlings were respectively sampled from the same plants at the same time for the same time point. Sampled tissues for the time-course study were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C prior to extraction of total RNA. Three independent biological replications were performed for each experiment.</p>
        <p>RNA for real-time PCR was isolated with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.

        <title>BSMV-mediated gene silencing</title>
        <p>Plasmids used for gene silencing were based on the constructs described by Holzberg and associates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Holzberg1">[33]</xref>. A cDNA fragment (120 bp) of the wheat phytoene desaturase gene <italic>TaPDS</italic> was obtained by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A RNA-derivative clone (BSMV:PDS) was created using BSMV:GFP (green fluorescent protein) cDNA as the starting material. The <italic>GFP</italic> coding sequence in BSMV: GFP was replaced by a PDS fragment in an antisense orientation resulting in BSMV:PDS. BSMV:TaAbc1 was constructed by the same approach; a 160 bp <italic>TaAbc1</italic> cDNA fragment amplified by a pair of primers TaAbc1-VIGS-F/R(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058969-t001">Table 1</xref>), derived from the 3&#x2032;untranslated region was inserted.</p>
        <p>Capped in vitro transcripts were prepared from linearized plasmids that contain the tripartite BSMV genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Petty1">[34]</xref> using the mMessage mMachine T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The BSMV inoculum was made by combining an equimolar ratio of &#x3B1;, &#x3B2;, and &#x3B3; transcripts at a 1&#x2236;1&#x2236;1 ratio with excess inoculation buffer (named as FES) containing a wounding agent. The third leaf of a three-leaf wheat seedling was inoculated with BSMV transcripts by gently rubbing the leaf surface with a gloved finger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Holzberg1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Hein1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058969-Scofield1">[36]</xref>.

Three independent sets of inoculations were performed, with a total of 72 seedlings inoculated for each of the three BSMV viruses (BSMV:00, BSMV:PDS, and BSMV:TaAbc1). Post viral inoculation, wheat plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 23&#xB1;2&#xB0;C, and examined for symptoms at regular intervals. Once photobleaching was observed, three independent sets of inoculations including CYR23, CYR31 and sterile water (as a mock), were performed. Infection types of stripe rust were examined at 15 days post rust inoculation.

At least 50 infection sites were examined on each of five randomly selected leaf segments per treatment. Only the infection sites with fungal appressoria formation over stomata were considered to have been successfully penetrated. The necrotic leaf area was measured with a calibrated eyepiece micrometer and corresponding areas (square micrometers) calculated according to the formula &#x3C0; &#xD7; length &#xD7; width/4.
