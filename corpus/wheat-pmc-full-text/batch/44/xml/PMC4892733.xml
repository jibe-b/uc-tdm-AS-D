        <p>Dormancy release by cold stratification depends on jasmonate biosynthesis in wheat grains</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Hydration at low temperatures, commonly referred to as cold stratification, is widely used for releasing dormancy and triggering germination in a wide range of species including wheat. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies its effect on germination has largely remained unknown. Our previous studies showed that methyl-jasmonate, a derivative of jasmonic acid (JA), promotes dormancy release in wheat. In this study, we found that cold-stimulated germination of dormant grains correlated with a transient increase in JA content and expression of JA biosynthesis genes in the dormant embryos after transfer to 20 <sup>o</sup>C. The induction of JA production was dependent on the extent of cold imbibition and precedes germination. Blocking JA biosynthesis with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) inhibited the cold-stimulated germination in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we have explored the relationship between JA and abscisic acid (ABA), a well-known dormancy promoter, in cold regulation of dormancy. We found an inverse relationship between JA and ABA content in dormant wheat embryos following stratification. ABA content decreased rapidly in response to stratification, and the decrease was reversed by addition of ASA. Our results indicate that the action of JA on cold-stratified grains is mediated by suppression of two key ABA biosynthesis genes, <italic>TaNCED1</italic> and <italic>TaNCED2</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Timing of germination is one of the most critical adaptation strategies used by plants to ensure reproductive success. In wild plant species, dormancy has a key role in ensuring survival of a population by blocking seed germination until conditions become favourable for germination and seedling establishment (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>). In addition to genetic determinants, environmental signals experienced during seed maturation and following dispersal strongly influence the timing of dormancy loss. Unlike many wild plant species, cultivated crops such as wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) display weak grain dormancy at maturity due to selective breeding against dormancy for uniform and vigorous germination. As a result, modern wheat varieties exhibit increased susceptibility to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) following cool and moist conditions in the field, which result in serious loss of grain yield and quality (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Gubler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#xED;guez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Thus, research aimed at understanding environmental and genetic control of dormancy will assist in developing new strategies for the elimination of PHS worldwide in domesticated crops.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">A variety of environmental signals including temperature, light quality, photoperiod, and nitrate have been shown to influence cereal dormancy (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#xED;guez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), with temperature widely recognized as the major signal (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Harrington, 1923</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Sawhney and Naylor, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Buraas and Skinnes, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Reddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Nyachiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Gu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, temperature effects on grain dormancy are very much dependent on the developmental stage. In general, temperature during grain development strongly influences dormancy, with cooler conditions producing more dormant grains (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barrero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Exposure to higher temperatures for brief or extended periods during grain maturation has been shown to reduce dormancy (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Gualano and Benech-Arnold, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">There is also a dramatic change in the low temperature responses once grains are imbibed. Imbibition at 4 <sup>o</sup>C, commonly referred to as cold stratification, is widely used to break dormancy (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bewley and Black, 1994</xref>). It is considered that cold stratification mimics the cold and moist conditions experience by cereals in soil during autumn and winter, during which seed dormancy is lost in order to trigger germination prior to spring. In wheat, stratification for 48h at 4 <sup>o</sup>C in the dark is sufficient to induce germination even in strongly dormant cultivars (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Mares, 1984</xref>). It is important to note that prematurely harvested grains as early as 18 d post-anthesis are capable of responding to stratification, although the effectiveness of the cold stratification increases with maturity (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Gosling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>). Even though the effect of cold is well known, the hormonal and molecular mechanisms by which cold stratification regulate cereal dormancy remain unknown.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Plant hormones play a key role in dormancy regulation through synergistic and antagonistic interactions. In cereals and other plants, abscisic acid (ABA) is considered to be the primary mediator in dormancy induction and maintenance (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#xED;guez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Shu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Genes encoding ABA metabolism enzymes appear to be major targets for environmental signals that promote dormancy, such as hypoxia, high temperature, and blue light (BL) (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#xED;guez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, dormancy release by after-ripening is mediated by a decrease in ABA content in imbibed wheat and barley grains as a result of co-ordinated promotion of ABA catabolism and repression of ABA biosynthesis genes (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Millar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">ABA action is regulated in part by crosstalk with other hormones such as gibberellins (GAs) and their associated signalling networks. Applications of GA, an antagonist of ABA, can be effective in breaking dormancy in cereals (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Tuttle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In Arabidopsis, GA is essential for germination, but this has not yet been demonstrated for cereals (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Peng and Harberd, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Gubler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Hauvermale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). A recent study has also demonstrated that jasmonates can act antagonistically to ABA by promoting dormancy release in wheat dormant grains (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Applications of methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) inhibited the expression of the ABA biosynthesis gene, <italic>Ta9-cis-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE1</italic> (<italic>TaNCED1</italic>), resulting in a decrease in ABA content in imbibed embryos prior to germination. However, in Arabidopsis, jasmonic acid (JA) and its precursor 12-<italic>cis</italic>-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) inhibited seed germination (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Dave <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), indicating that the role of JAs in dormancy varies according to the species. Other hormones such as ethylene, brassinosteroid, and auxin also play roles in germination of Arabidopsis, but as yet there is no information on whether they mediate dormancy processes in cereals (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Steber and McCourt, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Xue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; X, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Corbineau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Our current understanding of the role of hormones in cold stratification of seeds is very limited. In non-dormant Arabidopsis seeds, bioactive GA<sub>4</sub> content increased in response to low temperature during imbibition, due&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;to increased expression of a key GA biosynthesis gene (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Mutant analysis revealed that the <italic>AtGA3ox1</italic> gene is required for cold-stimulated seed germination. However, this work has not been extended to test if this is also the case in imbibed dormant seeds. In wheat, changes in ABA sensitivity have been observed in response to stratification (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Mares, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Noda <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), but it is not clear whether this is due to changes in ABA metabolism or signalling. Recently, a cold-induced increase in JA content was demonstrated in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to cold. In this study, some genes of the JA biosynthesis pathway such as lipoxygenase (<italic>LOX</italic>), allene oxide synthase (<italic>AOS</italic>), and allene oxide cyclase (<italic>AOC</italic>) were induced by cold (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). A cold-induced increase in JA has also been reported in rice roots (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Moons <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Although we have previously demonstrated that MeJA and JA promote dormancy release in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and that the JA biosynthesis pathway was up-regulated in the coleorhiza of non-dormant barley embryos compared with dormant grains (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Barrero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), there was no evidence linking JA with cold responses in grains.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In this study we have undertaken hormonal and molecular analyses to investigate the role of JAs and other hormones in stratification of dormant wheat grains. Applying optimized reversed phase liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), we found that JA and jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) contents increased rapidly in embryos of dormant grains following 48h stratification compared with grains that were incubated at 20 <sup>o</sup>C. Molecular analysis revealed that the increase in JA and JA-Ile correlated with expression of cold-inducible JA biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, using a jasmonate biosynthesis inhibitor, we showed that jasmonate synthesis is required for cold-induced germination in wheat. The results also indicated that the increase in JA triggers a decrease in ABA content in the embryos of cold-stratified grains. The results are in agreement with our earlier study which showed that JA is a repressor of ABA biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and they provide the first evidence that JAs play a central role in the release of seed dormancy by cold stratification.</p>

        <title>Endogenous JA and JA-Ile increase in response to cold stratification</title>
        <p>To characterize the responsiveness to stratification, dormant wheat grains (cv. Sunstate) were imbibed under BL (conditions in which dormancy is manifested to a greater extent) in the cold (4 <sup>o</sup>C) for periods of up to 84h prior to transfer to room temperature (20 <sup>o</sup>C) for 7 d (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Germination was assessed over the 7 d period and the effect of stratification time on the GI was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). GI increased with duration of cold stratification until 48h when dormancy was almost completely lost. Similarly, longer stratification for 72h and 84h resulted in only further small increases in GI. The observed response to stratification is similar to that previously published for other wheat cultivars (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Mares, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Noda <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>).</p>

        <p content-type="indent">We then measured JA production in wheat embryos following stratification. JA was quantified in dormant wheat grains that were imbibed in the cold for different times (12, 24, 48, and 72h) and transferred to room temperature for 24h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). JA content increased in wheat embryos that had been stratified for longer than 12h. The increase in JA content in the stratified grains correlated with the loss of dormancy, with close to maximal effect observed in grains that were stratified for 48h or longer prior to transfer to 20 <sup>o</sup>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>).</p>
        <p content-type="indent">To understand further the induction of JA production, we repeated the analysis of 48h stratified grains with more time points to better define changes in the content of JA and its associated metabolite, JA-Ile, following the cold treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, JA content in embryos increased (~10-fold) between 4h and 8h after transfer to 20 <sup>o</sup>C, and thereafter the content decreased rapidly back to levels similar to those found in wheat grains imbibed continuously in the cold.

        <p content-type="indent">We also examined the effect of dark on germination and JA content in cold-treated grains. In contrast to BL, imbibition of cv.

        <p>Following the demonstration that JA plays a role in cold-induced dormancy release, we looked to see whether the role could be extended to other dormancy release mechanisms. To determine whether JA had a role in dormancy release by dry after-ripening, JA content was monitored over a 60 d after-ripening period at 37 <sup>o</sup>C during which grains progressively lost dormancy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6A</ext-link>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>JA and its metabolites are ubiquitous signalling compounds known to regulate multiple processes including defence responses (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Browse, 2009</xref>), root elongation (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Staswick <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), freezing responses (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), male fertility (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">McConn and Browse, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), senescence (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Ueda and Kato, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Shan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), anthocyanin accumulation (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Franceschi and Grimes, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Shan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and flowering time (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Diallo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the present work, we have identified several lines of evidence that point to a new role for JA in dormancy release by cold stratification. First, we have found that JA biosynthesis in wheat embryos is induced following cold stratification of dormant grains and that the increase in JA content correlates with the effect on germination. The effect of cold stratification on JA accumulation was observed in wheat cultivars of different dormancy and was independent of light conditions used during imbibition. Importantly, the increase in JA content in cold-stratified grains, which happened at 4&#x2013;8h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2B</ext-link>) after transfer to room temperature, precedes the emergence of the coleorhiza (the earliest visual indication of grain germination after 8h; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S8</ext-link>), thus suggesting a causal link between the two events. We explored the possibility of JA being produced as a consequence of germination; however, that scenario was excluded as our results showed that there is no consistent change in JA and JA-Ile content in embryos of non-dormant grains that are undergoing germination (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S7A, B</ext-link>). Secondly, experiments with a JA biosynthesis inhibitor showed that JA production is sufficient and necessary for dormancy release by stratification. This is consistent with our previous results which showed that application of MeJA and JA reduces dormancy of wheat grains (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thirdly, our study provided evidence that the action of JA on dormancy release is at least in part mediated by reduced ABA content in embryos caused by reduced expression of ABA biosynthesis genes.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Cold-induced increases in JA content have been previously reported in plants. A small increase in JA-Ile (&lt;25%) and no change in JA content have been reported in embryos of wheat grains imbibed for 18h at 30 <sup>o</sup>C following a 24h stratification treatment compared with embryos from non-stratified grains (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Tuttle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). It is important to note that the 24h stratification used in the study only had a small effect on the GI of wheat grains imbibed in water. However, the authors reported that the short stratification time impacted on the sensitivity of the grains to GA and ABA. In general, our results support this result but also extend it to demonstrate that the transient increases in JA and JA-Ile occur much earlier, with the maxima achieved 8h after the stratification. Our data show a 10-fold increase in JA content and a 2-fold increase in JA-Ile content in embryos within the first 8h following transfer to 20 <sup>o</sup>C after stratification. Similar differences are found when the JA content in embryos 8h after stratification are compared with grains that are incubated continuously at 20 <sup>o</sup>C (non-stratified grains) or 4 <sup>o</sup>C (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Cold-induced increases in MeJA have also been reported in wheat seedlings (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Diallo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). MeJA accumulates in winter wheat during vernalization and then decreases rapidly once the plants are transferred to inductive flowering conditions. The decrease in MeJA precedes the rise in expression of <italic>TaVRN1</italic> and <italic>TaFT1</italic>, indicating that MeJA may suppress expression of flowering time genes during vernalization and thus delaying flowering until the plants are exposed to warmer temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Diallo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). It is now clear that vernalization and stratification in wheat are both mediated at least in part by the accumulation of JAs. It is intriguing to note that in both instances accumulation in JAs precedes activation of growth processes both in the embryonic axis and in the vegetative apex.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The role of JAs may not only vary depending on the developmental stage of various tissue types and between seeds from different species. The JA response to stratification in wheat grains appears to be fundamentally different from that in Arabidopsis, since it only occurs after the cold treatment, once the grains are transferred to room temperature. In Arabidopsis seedlings, JA accumulated rapidly within 1.5h of transfer from 22 <sup>o</sup>C to 4 <sup>o</sup>C, triggering the expression of the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION-C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR transcriptional pathway (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This response appeared to be related to cold stress responses, and the increase in JA enhanced the seedling freezing tolerance.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Our data indicate that in wheat dormancy, the role of JAs is restricted to cold stratification and not other dormancy release mechanisms such as after-ripening or darkness. We found that JA and JA-Ile contents were very similar in embryos from dormant and after-ripened grain imbibed over 24h at 20 <sup>o</sup>C, with content declining 3- to 4-fold over this period. This is in agreement with an earlier study of wheat grain dormancy which found that JA and JA-Ile content declined in whole dormant and after-ripened grains over 24h hydration at room temperature (A. <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Similarly, we found little difference between dormant grains that were imbibed in the dark or BL even though the grains had different germination outcomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S7A, B</ext-link>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">We have previously shown that wheat grains have different responses to MeJA depending on the dormancy status. Application of MeJA to dormant grain strongly promoted dormancy release, but in after-ripened grain the application of MeJA inhibited the growth of the embryo (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The dependence on the dormancy status in determining the role of JA may also explain why there are reports of JAs promoting or repressing germination in a number of other plant species (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Daletskaya and Sembdner, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Berestetsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Ranjan and Lewak, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Krock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Yildiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Preston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This dual role of JA could explain why the cold-induced JA production is transitory; otherwise it would affect embryo growth once dormancy is released.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The role of JAs in seeds hase been previously studied in Arabidopsis, but their functions seem different from those in wheat grains. For example, large differences in JA and JA-Ile content have been reported in dry seeds from Arabidopsis ecotypes which differ in their level of dormancy, the content higher being in non-dormant than in dormant ecotypes (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Preston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, so far, there is no functional evidence supporting a role for that correlation. Moreover, the role of JA and OPDA has also been examined in non-dormant Arabidopsis seeds. In that work, using single and double mutants, it was established that OPDA has an inhibitory effect on germination by increasing ABA sensitivity, and that JA and JA-Ile had no effect (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Dave <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In wheat, the application of OPDA has small effects promoting germination (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw172/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S9</ext-link>), and the content of this molecule was below the level of detection in our stratification assays. Taken together, these results suggest that the role of JA, JA-Ile, and OPDA in dormancy and germination could be different between dicot and monocot species, although more genetic work is needed to confirm this conclusion.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In Arabidopsis seedlings, cold rapidly up-regulates expression of a number of key genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway including <italic>LOX1&#x2013;LOX3</italic>, <italic>AOS</italic>, <italic>AOC1&#x2013;AOC4</italic>, and <italic>JAR1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We found in wheat that the expression of <italic>TaAOS1-2</italic> and <italic>TaAOC1-3</italic> increased rapidly only after the cold stratification treatment and that this correlated with the rapid rise in JA content. ASA blocked the cold-induced increase in JA content and germination, possibly in part by temporally suppressing the cold-induced expression of <italic>TaAOC1</italic> and <italic>TaAOC2</italic> genes. Furthermore this evidence confirms the contribution of both <italic>TaAOC</italic> genes to the cold-induced transient increase in JA. In flax leaves, ASA has been shown to block JA production via inhibition of <italic>AOS</italic> expression (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Harms <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), indicating that ASA is able to alter the expression of different JA biosynthesis genes in different plants. It is important to note that recent work has shown that salicylic acid inhibition of JA biosynthesis is a consequence of feedback inhibition caused by repression of JA signalling (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Leon-Reyes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">van der Does et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p content-type="indent">The role of ABA as a principal dormancy promoter and germination inhibitor has been extensively reported (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, little is known about crosstalk between JA and ABA signalling pathways in cereals. ABA and JA show a synergistic relationship in response to several abiotic and biotic stresses such as wounding, salinity, or pathogen attack (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Forcat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In contrast, an antagonistic interaction between the signalling pathways for those hormones has been recorded for other stresses (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Moons <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Nakata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), thus indicating that the nature of ABA and JA crosstalk is complex and stress dependent. In relation to wheat grains, we have identified an inverse relationship between JA and ABA content in response to 48h stratification, and we have asked if the two responses are inter-related. Our results show that the decrease in ABA content precedes the increase in JA content and that ABA content remains low after the transient spike in JA content. Our results are consistent with a recent report which found that a 24h cold stratification treatment of wheat grains was associated with a small decrease in ABA and a small increase in JA-Ile content (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Tuttle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). We explored the possibility that ABA might suppress JA synthesis in wheat embryos by determining whether ABA could suppress JA production. Addition of 100 &#x3BC;M ABA to wheat grains undergoing cold stratification failed to block the production of a transient spike in JA, indicating that the increase in JA and the initial rapid decrease in ABA content in response to cold stratification are independent events. However, we were able to show that JA may have a key role in maintenance of low ABA content following the rapid initial decrease in response to cold. By blocking JA production in cold-stratified grains with ASA, we were able to show that ABA content rapidly increased to levels similar to those found before stratification. We were also able to show that the increase in ABA content in ASA-treated grains can be attributed to a promotion of expression of the key ABA biosynthesis genes, <italic>TaNCED1</italic> and <italic>TaNCED2</italic>. This was consistent with our previous finding that MeJA promotion of dormancy release in wheat acts via inhibition of ABA biosynthesis by suppressing <italic>TaNCED1</italic> expression in embryos of dormant grains (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the decline and maintenance of low ABA content in stratified grains is, at least in part, directly attributed to JA suppression of ABA synthesis. It has been shown that dormant wheat grains lose ABA sensitivity in response to cold (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Noda <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Tuttle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), but it has yet to be determined if the change in ABA sensitivity is due to cold-induced changes in ABA signalling mechanisms. However, it is important to note that manipulation of expression of ABA metabolism genes can also lead to alterations in ABA sensitivity (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Thus, JA-induced changes in ABA content may be responsible, at least in part, for changes in ABA sensitivity.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">Previous studies of seed germination have established a link between cold stratification and GA. In particular, increases in GA content during cold stratification have been observed in seeds of several plant species (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">West, 1970</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Rudnioki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This evidence, along with the demonstration that GA application is often effective in breaking dormancy, has led to the proposal that cold-induced increases in GA content are responsible for increased germination (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, in agreement with a previous study (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Tuttle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), we were not able to detect any bioactive GAs in our cold-stratified grains, indicating that the content of these GAs is very low and thus likely not to have a role. The demonstration that the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol did not inhibit cold stratification promotion of germination provides evidence that GA biosynthesis is not critical for the response in wheat. In contrast, we were able to detect changes in some GA precursors and catabolites, indicating that GA metabolism is active in cold-treated grains but its role remains unknown.</p>
      <p content-type="indent">In conclusion, our study in wheat leads us to propose a model showing that JA and ABA have opposing roles in the regulation of dormancy release by stratification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). ABA repression of germination acts through two signalling pathways, one independent of JA (dotted line) and one dependent on JA signalling mechanisms. We showed that the cold-induced increase in JA content is necessary for dormancy release and that its action is mediated, at least in part, by repression of ABA biosynthesis genes, <italic>TaNCED1</italic> and <italic>TaNCED2</italic>. <italic>NCED1</italic> in wheat and barley has been previously shown to be regulated by a number of other environmental conditions such as high temperature stress (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Leymarie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), BL (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and after-ripening (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Gubler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, we have now shown that both <italic>TaNCED1</italic> and <italic>TaNCED2</italic> are down-regulated in response to cold in a JA-independent pathway (dotted line). Further investigations are now needed to determine how cold stratification promotes JA biosynthesis and at the same time inhibits ABA biosynthesis.</p>

          <p>Model summarizing the role of JA and ABA in dormancy release by cold stratification in wheat. Stratification stimulates rapid changes in two hormones known to regulate dormancy. First, there is a decrease in ABA content, independent of JA (dotted line), which is driven by the repression of <italic>TaNCED1</italic> and <italic>TaNCED2</italic>. Secondly, there is a cold-induced increase in JA content that also decreases ABA by repressing the <italic>NCED</italic> genes. The increase in JA is driven by the cold-induced expression of <italic>TaAOS</italic> and <italic>TaAOC</italic>. Blockage of JA biosynthesis using ASA results in high ABA content; thus, the maintenance of low ABA after stratification is dependent on JA production. In cereals, <italic>NCED1</italic> is a common key target of environmental factors (cold, heat, light, and after-ripening) that affect germination.</p>
