      <abstract>
        <p>Ubiquitination is a key post-translational modification in the regulation of numerous biological processes in eukaryotes. The primary roles of ubiquitination are thought to be the triggering of protein degradation and the regulation of signal transduction. During protein ubiquitination, substrate specificity is mainly determined by E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3). Although more than 600 genes in the human genome encode E3, the E3s of many target proteins remain unidentified owing to E3 diversity and the instability of ubiquitinated proteins in cell. We demonstrate herein a novel biochemical analysis for the identification of E3s targeting specific proteins. Using wheat cell-free protein synthesis system, a protein array containing 227 human and 23 mouse recombinant E3s was synthesized. To establish the high-throughput binding assay using AlphaScreen technology, we selected MDM2 and p53 as the model combination of E3 and its target protein. The AlphaScreen assay specifically detected the binding of p53 and MDM2 in a crude translation mixture. Then, a comprehensive binding assay using the E3 protein array was performed. Eleven of the E3s showed high binding activity, including four previously reported E3s (e.g., MDM2, MDM4, and WWP1) targeting p53. This result demonstrated the reliability of the assay. Another interactors, RNF6 and DZIP3&#x2014;which there have been no report to bind p53&#x2014;were found to ubiquitinate p53 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further analysis showed that RNF6 decreased the amount of p53 in H1299 cells in E3 activity-dependent manner. These results suggest the possibility that the RNF6 ubiquitinates and degrades p53 in cells. The novel <italic>in vitro</italic> screening system established herein is a powerful tool for finding novel E3s of a target protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein ubiquitination plays crucial roles in numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, regulation of diverse signal transduction, and the development of disease [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The small protein ubiquitin covalently attaches to the lysine residues of target proteins through its C-terminal glycine, thereby changing protein stability, function, or localization [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The attachment of a single ubiquitin molecule to a substrate is called mono-ubiquitination. Furthermore, the conjugation of one ubiquitin with another through their seven lysine residues or N-terminal methionine forms a polyubiquitin chain, each of which has a distinct function. For example, the polyubiquitin chain through lysine 48 induces target protein degradation by 26S proteasomes [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the polyubiquitin chain through lysine 63 functions as a scaffold for protein-protein interaction to mediate signal transduction [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or form a protein complex involved in DNA repair [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Ubiquitination is mediated by three enzymatic reactions. Initially, ubiquitin is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 in an ATP-dependent manner via the formation of a high-energy thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and a core cysteine residue of E1. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a core cysteine residue of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2. Then, both E2 and the target protein bind to E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3), and E3 catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the lysine residue of the target protein binding with E3 [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the substrate specificity of protein ubiquitination is widely thought to be determined mainly by E3 [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To date, more than 600 E3s have been annotated in the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and this diversity contributes to the specific recognition of numerous target proteins in eukaryotic cells. Identifying the E3 responsible for a target protein provides extensive information about the regulation mechanisms of half-life, localization, and functions in both the target proteins and the E3s in each biological phenomenon. In addition, interactions between E3s and their target proteins are considered attractive targets for drug discovery. For example, MDM2, an E3 that targets the tumor suppressor p53, is overexpressed in cancers such as sarcomas and leukemias [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nutlin and its derivatives block the binding of MDM2 and p53 and protect p53 from proteasomal degradation, which results in cell death and the induction of apoptosis in many cancer-derived cell lines with intact p53 [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, chemical compounds targeting E3s such as Skp2 have been found to induce cell cycle arrest in various cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of novel E3s targeting proteins of physiological significance has become a priority.</p>
      <p>Assays based on living cells such as yeast, mammalian cultured cells, and model mouse are currently the primary tools used to identify combinations of E3s and their target proteins. Indeed, many physiologically important interactions between E3 and target protein were identified with various kinds of the cell-based assay [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, these assays have some limitations. First, ubiquitinated proteins are usually degraded immediately by 26S proteasomes, and proteins ubiquitinated as non-degradative forms, such as K63, tend to shift to the insoluble fraction when cells are lysed. Second, some E3s are toxic to cells, further complicating the study of E3s with living cell assays. Third, the results from cell-based assays such as shRNA screening and immunoprecipitation from cell lysate often include indirect interactions. Therefore, the E3s of many target proteins&#x2014;even widely studied proteins&#x2014;remain unidentified.</p>
      <p>Biochemical assays detecting direct binding between E3s and substrates by using recombinant proteins appear to be reasonable alternatives to assays using living cells because they exclude the possibility of low or absent expression of E3 or target proteins and the process of protein degradation in cells. These biochemical assays require the preparation of hundreds of active recombinant E3 proteins, but conventional protein-expressing systems such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and insect cells have serious limitations. Furthermore, detecting the binding reactions of hundreds of proteins with general methods such as immunoprecipitation is extraordinarily difficult. To overcome these challenges, we used two methods in this study: a wheat germ-based cell-free protein synthesis system (wheat cell-free system), which efficiently produces many eukaryotic proteins including E3 in a 96-well format [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and a high-throughput luminescence-based binding assay that is able to use crude protein samples (AlphaScreen). Combining these methods, we developed a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> screening assay using a protein array containing 250 E3s for the identification of novel interactions between E3 and their target proteins. Our preliminary screening with p53 found a high luminescence signal from interactions between p53 and known E3s such as MDM2 and MDM4. Novel E3s were also identified, and taken together, these results demonstrated that the assay developed herein is a powerful tool for the identification of novel E3s targeting proteins of interest.</p>

        <title>Preparation of the E3 protein array</title>
        <p>The E3s belonging to the single subunit E3 group such as HECT-type, U-box-type and many of RING-type are thought to recognize and ubiquitinate their target proteins without components other than E1 and E2 [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another E3 group termed &#x201C;multiple subunit E3&#x201D; such as SCF- and APC-complex E3s requires multiple components for recognition and ubiquitination of target protein. In order to simplify the assay established here, we selected the single subunit E3 group as first trial and designed the assay to detect direct interaction between E3 and target protein so as to identify E3 for a target protein. At the beginning of this study, 232 human cDNAs encoding human E3 were selected from mammalian gene collection (MGC) clones covering more than 20,000 human full-length cDNAs without redundancy. In addition, cDNAs for three human and 23 mouse E3s not contained in the MGC clones were obtained from the NITE clone and FANTOM commercial full-length cDNA catalogs, respectively. Because many of the cDNAs in the MGC clones were inserted into backbone vectors unsuitable for the PCR to prepare transcription templates (the vectors in category A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s003">S1 Table</xref>), they were subcloned into pDONR221 by using Gateway technology. The detailed procedure and overview of the subcloning strategy are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Using these cDNAs, 258 DNA templates for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, including 241 RING-type, six U-box-type, and 11 HECT-type E3s, were prepared with a split-primer PCR method [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

        <title>Model assay using p53 and MDM2</title>
        <p>To establish the novel biochemical assay for identification of E3s for their target proteins, we selected the previously reported interaction between p53 and MDM2 as a model. This combination is one of the most widely studied target protein-E3 interactions. The transcription template of <italic>MDM2</italic> was obtained from the E3 cDNA library prepared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g001">Fig 1</xref>. In addition, several reports have shown that cysteine 438 in the RING domain of MDM2 is critical for its E3 activity [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, a transcription template of <italic>MDM2</italic> in which cysteine 438 was replaced with serine (C/S) was prepared and used as a control MDM2 without E3 activity. The transcription template of <italic>p53</italic> was amplified by using the described split-primer PCR method. Furthermore, the transcription template of a mutant <italic>p53</italic> lacking the amino acids (residues 13&#x2013;19) to interact with MDM2 (&#x2206;I) was also prepared and used as a negative control [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
        <p>The recombinant proteins of MDM2 and p53 were synthesized with the wheat cell-free system in an N-terminal FLAG-tagged form and an N-terminal single biotinylated form, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, wild-type and &#x2206;I mutant of p53 were synthesized successfully, and nearly identical amounts of recombinant p53 and MDM2 were observed in the whole translation mixture (W) and the supernatant (S) after the centrifugation of the former, which indicated that these proteins were synthesized in soluble forms. In addition, a conventional immunoprecipitation assay using anti-FLAG antibody showed that wild-type p53 but not &#x2206;I was bound to MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Expression of recombinant proteins of p53 and MDM2 with the wheat cell-free system. Wild-type (WT) and mutant p53 lacking the amino acid residues required for binding with MDM2 (&#x2206;I) were synthesized as N-terminal biotinylated form. Wild-type MDM2 and its mutant with a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic core cysteine residue (C/S) were synthesized as N-terminal FLAG-tagged protein. Biotinylated and FLAG-dihydrofolate reductase (FLAG-DHFR) were used as negative controls for p53 and MDM2, respectively. The total translation mixture of each protein was centrifuged, and the whole translation mixture (W) and supernatant (S) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis (IB) using the antibodies indicated below. (B) Binding assay of biotinylated p53 and FLAG-MDM2 using a conventional immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Fifteen microliters of crude biotinylated p53 (WT or &#x2206;I) and FLAG-MDM2 were mixed and precipitated with anti-FLAG-antibody. Immunopreciptates were detected with anti-FLAG antibody and anti-biotin antibody. FLAG-DHFR was used as controls for FLAG-MDM2.

After the ubiquitination reaction, biotinylated p53 was pulled down with streptavidin (STA) magnet beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-HA-antibody (for ubiquitin) and anti-biotin antibody (for p53).</p>

        <p>To confirm that the binding between recombinant MDM2 and p53 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g002">Fig 2A</xref> was a functional interaction, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay using the recombinant MDM2 and p53. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, significant ubiquitination of p53 by MDM2 was observed only when biotinylated p53 was mixed with wild-type MDM2 but not C/S mutant of MDM2 or &#x2206;I mutant of p53. These results indicated that the recombinant p53 and MDM2 synthesized with the wheat cell-free system functionally interacted in manner similar to that reported previously.</p>

        <title>Establishment of the high-throughput biochemical assay using AlphaScreen</title>
        <p>In order to identify E3s for a target protein from the E3 protein array, a first screening was designed to detect direct binding between E3s and target protein, because many of single subunit E3s we used in this study directly bind to target protein prior to ubiquitination. To establish the high-throughput binding assay, we used an AlphaScreen, a luminescence-based interaction assay, to detect interaction between recombinant MDM2 and p53. This assay is performed in a 384-well format with only small amount (0.5 to 1.0 &#x3BC;L) of the crude translation mixtures from the wheat cell-free system without purification [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, a high luminescence signal was observed when 0.75 &#x3BC;L of crude FLAG-MDM2 and wild-type biotinylated p53 were reacted. By contrast, only a background signal was obtained when either FLAG-MDM2 or biotinylated p53 were replaced by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a negative control protein. In addition, &#x2206;I mutant of p53 showed a faint signal even in the presence of FLAG-MDM2, which indicated that, similar to the immunoprecipitation assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), the AlphaScreen assay detected interaction between MDM2 and p53.</p>

Crude translation mixtures of biotinylated p53 (WT or &#x2206;I) and FLAG-MDM2 (0.75 &#x3BC;L each) were used for the assay. FLAG-DHFR was used as a control for MDM2. (B) A reaction mixture containing p53 and MDM2 prepared under the same conditions as those in (A) was mixed with 2, 10, or 50 &#x3BC;M Nutlin-3. Biotinylated FLAG-peptide was used as a control to measure the interference of Nutlin-3 in the AlphaScreen assay. (C) Validation of the quality of the AlphaScreen assay. Z&#x2032; factor was calculated from the reaction of wild-type p53 and MDM2 (positive control, n = 40, square) and the reaction of p53 &#x2206;I mutant and MDM2 (negative control, n = 40, circle). In (A) and (B), all data are expressed as mean values of three independent experiments with error bars indicating standard deviations.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To further validate that the luminescence signal obtained in the AlphaScreen assay was an indicator of p53-MDM2 binding, we added Nutlin-3, a known small chemical compound inhibitor that blocks p53-MDM2 binding [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], to the AlphaScreen assay reaction. As expected, the luminescence signal decreased significantly with the addition of 2 &#x3BC;M Nutlin-3 and nearly disappeared when 50 &#x3BC;M was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also assessed the accuracy and quality of the AlphaScreen assay by calculating the Z&#x2032; factor. Assays with a Z&#x2032; factor greater than 0.5 are considered accurate and suitable for high-throughput screening [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using 40 independent reactions containing biotinylated wild-type p53 and FLAG-MDM2 as the positive reaction and p53&#x2206;I and FLAG-MDM2 as the negative reaction, we obtained a Z&#x2032; factor of 0.61, which indicated that the assay was reliable.</p>

        <title>High-throughput binding assay to detect the binding between p53 and 250 E3s</title>
        <p>We next screened p53-binding E3s from the protein array containing 250 E3s by using the constructed binding assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Eight of E3s that the immunoblot analysis failed to detect (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s003">S1 Table</xref>) were also used for the binding assay as negative control. To subtract the background signal of each E3 obtained mainly from nonspecific binding between E3 and the detection beads or antibody, we also detected binding between all of the E3s and DHFR, the negative control. The value of the luminescence signal obtained from the reaction of E3 and biotinylated p53 was divided by the value of the reaction of E3 and biotinylated DHFR to yield a relative value indicating the binding activity of each E3 to p53.</p>
        <p>The results of the binding assay demonstrated that in addition to MDM2, MDM4 gave an extremely high luminescence signal relative to those of the other E3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Except for these two E3s, nine E3s also showed a relative luminescence value of more than 8. Among these E3s, seven E3s such as RAG1 and RNF6 have not been reported to interact with p53, whereas MSL2 and WWP1 have been reported previously as E3s for p53 [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, all of the E3s that failed to observe their expression in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s001">S1 Fig</xref> showed only slight luminescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, green arrowheads). The relative luminescent signals of all E3s were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s003">S1 Table</xref>, and the E3s for which the relative luminescence signal was higher than 8 are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0156718.t001">Table 1</xref>. Since the expression level of each crude recombinant E3 used in the binding assay was not equal (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), it was still unclear whether the various level of luminescent signal from individual E3s were due to the difference of the affinity of E3 to p53 or the amount of E3 protein. To solve this, MDM2, RAG1 and TRIM6 that showed highest, modest and low luminescent signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, respectively, were selected and the binding assay was performed with various amount of these proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, MDM2 showed higher signal than RAG1 in all of four kinds of protein amount we tested. Even the luminescent signal obtained from the smallest amount of MDM2 (0.25 &#x3BC;l) was still much higher than that from the largest amount of RAG1 (3.0 &#x3BC;l). TRIM6 showed the lowest signal in all of protein amount The results of binding assay suggest that the luminescent signals reflect the affinity of each E3 to target protein rather the amount, at least to the amount applied shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s002">S2 Fig</xref>.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether the newly identified p53-binding E3s have E3 activity for p53, we subjected them to an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay. MDM2 and WWP1 were used as positive controls. The results showed that, in addition to the positive control E3s, RNF6 and DZIP3 ubiquitinated p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), although the intensity of p53 ubiquitination by MDM2 was much higher than that by other three E3s. These results suggested that RNF6 and DZIP3 are novel E3s targeting p53, and RNF6 that showed higher luminescent signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4A</xref> was selected and used for further studies using cell-based assay.</p>

        <p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using recombinant E3s revealed that RNF6 bound to and ubiquitinated p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Since one of the major roles of ubiquitination is thought to be the degradation of target protein by 26S proteasome activity, we speculated that RNF6 might ubiquitinate and degrade p53 in cell. To confirm this hypothesis, we co-transfected RNF6 and p53 into H1299 lung carcinoma cells to investigate the RNF6-dependent destabilization of p53. Initially, the expression level of p53 in the presence or absence of RNF6 was measured with an immunoblot analysis using the total cell lysate, which showed that the amount of p53 was decreased by RNF6 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To investigate whether this decrease in p53 expression depends on E3 activity of RNF6, we substituted the RING domain cysteine residues at positions 632 and 635 with serine (C/S). This activity-deficient RNF6 mutant was co-transfected with p53 but did not affect the p53 expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Then, we checked whether this decreased p53 expression level was due to reduction of stability of p53, a pulse-chase analysis was carried out using cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. As a result, the amount of p53 was decreased in the presence of wild-type RNF6 after treatment with cycloheximide from two hours, whereas only slight change was observed in the presence of C/S mutant of RNF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), indicating that RNF6 down-regulated the expression level of p53 in a post-translational manner. Furthermore, effect of RNF6 knockdown on the amount of p53 was analyzed. Two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for RNF6 with different target sequences or control siRNA were transfected with H1299 cells. As a result, the amount of p53 was significantly increased by the knockdown of RNF6 but not by control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These results, together with the result of <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, suggested that RNF6 down-regulated the expression level of p53 in cells through ubiquitination of p53.</p>

Cell lysates from each reaction were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-V5 antibody and anti-FLAG antibody. The band intensity of p53 in each reaction was quantified using imageJ software. Relative intensities normalized with the reaction of empty vector were indicated below the blot detected with anti-V5 antibody.

H1299 cells co-transfected with p53-V5 and wild-type or C/S mutant of FLAG-RNF6 were treated with 100 &#x3BC;g/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) for indicated time periods.

      <p>In this study, we developed a robust biochemical assay platform based on a protein array containing 250 recombinant E3 proteins and the high-throughput binding assay AlphaScreen. Using this assay, we identified some novel p53-binding E3s. Further analysis confirmed that RNF6 ubiquitinated p53 <italic>in vitro</italic> and down-regulated p53 expression in cells, which indicated the effectiveness of this assay platform for identifying novel E3 interactions with target proteins.</p>
      <p>As for the high-throughput biochemical screening to identify the interaction between E3 and target protein, protein array/chip technology is often used. For example, some studies screened the target proteins of E3s using the protein chip containing thousands of yeast or human proteins, and identified many target proteins that were ubiquitinated by the E3s in cells. [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This report showed the effectiveness of the protein array technology. In this study, we aimed to identify novel E3 targeting protein of interest, therefore the protein array focused on E3s were prepared. Generally, the preparation of a large number of E3s is difficult with conventional expression systems such as those using <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and baculoviruses. However, our previous studies showed that the wheat cell-free system could synthesize active forms of recombinant proteins of RING-type and HECT-type E3s from the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the case of human E3, Tan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] prepared 72 purified E3s with the wheat cell-free system and identified a novel E3 involved in the integration activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Although some E3s are self-ubiquitinated and degraded by 26S proteasomes in cells, the wheat cell-free system contains only negligible 26S proteasome activity, thereby allowing the stable expression of active E3s [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The results of these studies clearly show that the wheat cell-free system is suitable for the synthesis of E3 protein. Taking advantage of this system, therefore, we prepared a protein array containing hundreds of E3s for this study. Using commercial cDNA catalogs such as MGC, we prepared a total of 258 transcription templates containing 241 RING-type, six U-box-type, and 11 HECT-type E3s. After cell-free protein synthesis, immunoblot analysis confirmed that 250 of the 258 E3s (approximately 96%) were prepared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that this E3 protein array covered 75% of the single subunit E3 reported by Li <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, recombinant MDM2, WWP1, RNF6 and DZIP3 showed p53 ubiquitination activity on the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Again, these results demonstrated the robustness of the wheat cell-free system for synthesis of E3, although the number of synthesized E3s that retained their activity remains unclear and it must be elucidated in a future study.</p>
      <p>Using this E3 protein array, we aimed to identify E3 for a target protein of interest by detecting direct binding between E3 and target protein instead of ubiquitination of target protein by E3. Previously an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay to detect ubiquitination of target protein using AlphaScreen system was demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], however, the purified E3 and target protein are required for this assay. Although we also have tried to detect ubiquitination of target protein by the AlphaScreen using crude recombinant proteins, the sensitivity was quite low probably because the E3 ubiquitinates not only substrate protein but the endogenous proteins in wheat germ extract. Moreover, the study by Tan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] demonstrated the <italic>in vitro</italic> screen using purified E3s prepared with wheat cell-free system, but 25% of the E3s could not be prepared properly. To consider the risk of purification, we based our assay platform on AlphaScreen technology that detects the binding interaction of E3s and substrate proteins by using crude translation mixture without purifications. In the AlphaScreen assay, donor beads and acceptor beads for detection specifically recognize biotinylated substrates and FLAG-tagged E3, respectively; therefore, specific interactions between E3 and its target protein in crude translation mixture are detected. We observed a high luminescence signal with slight background in our model study using the combination of MDM2 and p53, whereas these luminescence signals were not observed when mutant p53 lacking amino acids required for the binding with MDM2 was used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition, Nutlin-3, a small chemical compound inhibitor that blocks p53-MDM2 interaction, significantly decreased the luminescence signal observed with the p53-MDM2 combination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156718.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These results indicated that the binding assay established herein detected the p53-MDM2 interaction in a manner similar to those previously reported for <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our assay could also be carried out solely by mixing the crude proteins and reagents for detection (such as AlphaScreen beads and antibody) in a 384-well plate, and this simplicity in experimental procedure is another advantages of our assay.</p>
      <p>The results of the comprehensive binding assay using 250 E3 proteins showed that compared with other E3s, two well-known E3s&#x2014;MDM2 and MDM4&#x2014;gave extremely high luminescence signals even though their expression levels were not much higher than those of the other proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This result was consistent with the results of previous reports showing that MDM2 and MDM4 are the dominant binding partners of p53 in many cells [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition to MDM2 and MDM4, some previously reported E3s for p53 such as MLS2 and WWP1 resulted in high luminescence signals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0156718.t001">Table 1</xref>), which indicated the reliability of our assay. Some of the other E3s known to target p53 did not show significant binding activity in the present study. These included the E3s identified with cell-based analyses such as immunoprecipitation, and it is possible that these E3s require additional cellular components for binding with p53. However, well-studied E3s such as RCHY1 (also called Pirh2) and COP1, for which direct binding to p53 has already been reported [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], showed only slight luminescence signals, even when the production of these E3s was confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156718.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This result might be attributable to the differences in the binding assays, the location of the tag on each protein, and requirements for post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation for the binding of E3 to the substrate.</p>
      <p>The comprehensive screening in this study identified three novel p53 binding E3s, RAG1, RNF6 and DZIP3, and an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay showed that RNF6 and DZIP3 ubiquitinated p53. In addition, the expression level of p53 was decreased in H1299 cells when wild-type RNF6 but not C/S mutant of RNF6 was co-transfected. Although we carried out the cell-based ubiquitination assay to check the RNF6-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in cells, no significant ubiquitination of p53 was observed in the cells overexpressing wild-type RNF6. Considering the fact that RNF6 ubiquitinated p53 <italic>in vitro</italic> and decreased the stability of p53 in cells, however, it is possible that RNF6 ubiquitinates p53 in cells. The physiological functions of RNF6 are poorly understood, but recently one report showed that RNF6 was overexpressed in various leukemia cells, and induced proliferation of these cells. These results strongly indicated that RNF6 acts as an oncogene in these cells [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, it was found that RNF6 bound to and degraded tumor suppressor p53 probably through ubiquitin/proteasome dependent manner. These results raise the possibility that RNF6-dependent p53 degradation is one of the triggers of canceration in these cells. In addition, another study reported that both RNF6 and MDM2 bind and ubiquitinate androgen receptors [<xref rid="pone.0156718.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], suggesting that these two E3s function in close proximity and share some of the same target proteins in cells. Further analysis is required to elucidate the physiological significance of the RNF6-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of p53 in cells.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our protein array-based <italic>in vitro</italic> assay platform is a powerful tool for identifying novel E3s for target proteins. The assay enables not only the identification of the binding E3s of target proteins but also the performance of a ubiquitination assay that uses the same recombinant E3 protein. As a result of our screening using a p53 model, known E3s such MDM2 as well as an unknown E3 were identified as &#x201C;hits,&#x201D; which indicated that this assay is likely to be effective for identifying novel E3s targeting other proteins.</p>
