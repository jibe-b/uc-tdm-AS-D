      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Herbaspirillum seropedicae</italic> is a plant growth-promoting diazotrophic betaproteobacterium which associates with important crops, such as maize, wheat, rice and sugar-cane. We have previously reported that intact lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is required for <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment and endophytic colonization of maize roots. In this study, we present evidence that the LPS biosynthesis gene <italic>waaL</italic> (codes for the O-antigen ligase) is induced during rhizosphere colonization by <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>. Furthermore a <italic>waaL</italic> mutant strain lacking the O-antigen portion of the LPS is severely impaired in colonization. Since N-acetyl glucosamine inhibits <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment to maize roots, lectin-like proteins from maize roots (MRLs) were isolated and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that MRL-1 and MRL-2 correspond to maize proteins with a jacalin-like lectin domain, while MRL-3 contains a B-chain lectin domain. These proteins showed agglutination activity against wild type <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>, but failed to agglutinate the <italic>waaL</italic> mutant strain. The agglutination reaction was severely diminished in the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine. Moreover addition of the MRL proteins as competitors in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment assays decreased 80-fold the adhesion of the wild type to maize roots. The results suggest that N-acetyl glucosamine residues of the LPS O-antigen bind to maize root lectins, an essential step for efficient bacterial attachment and colonization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>H. seropedicae</italic> is a plant growth-promoting diazotrophic betaproteobacterium found in association with maize, sugarcane, rice, sorghum and wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Baldani1">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-James1">[5]</xref>. The effective stimulus of plant growth depends on an efficient colonization. However, the mechanisms of establishment of interaction between associative endophytes and plants are not fully understood. Molecules of the bacterial envelope such as flagella proteins, exopolysaccharides, adhesins and lipopolysaccharides are the first structures that contact the host, and may be required for bacterial attachment on root surfaces. In particular, several roles have been demonstrated for the LPS in plant-microbe interactions, including communication, protective barrier against plant antimicrobials and modulation of plant defense responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Lerouge1">[6]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-OrmeoOrrilo1">[9]</xref>. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are highly complex macromolecules found exclusively as a monolayer on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Collins1">[10]</xref>. These glycoconjugates are composed of three regions: the lipid A that anchors the molecule to the outer cell membrane, the core oligosaccharide and the O-antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Sutherland1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Raetz1">[12]</xref>. The biogenesis of O-antigen can be divided in four stages: 1) initiation, 2) elongation/translocation/polymerization of O-antigen repeating subunits; 3) ligation of O-antigen repeating subunits to the lipid A-core, and 4) recycling of the Und-PP polyisoprenoid carrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Valvano1">[13]</xref>. The attachment of the O-antigen to the core is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme called WaaL which is a key step for LPS biosynthesis. WaaL catalyzes the glycosidic bonding of a sugar at the proximal end of the undecaprenyl-diphosphate (Und-PP) O-antigen with a terminal sugar of the lipid A-core oligosaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Ruan1">[14]</xref>. The <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> WaaL protein (402 amino acids) contains 10 predicted transmembrane domains and the highly conserved Arg-215 that in <italic>E.coli</italic> is important for O-antigen ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Ruan1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Studies with associative bacteria showed that modification of LPS reduces plant colonization and competitiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Simons1">[15]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Jofr1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-OrmeoOrrilo1">[9]</xref>. In a previous work we constructed <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> mutant strains in the genes <italic>rfbB</italic> and <italic>rfbC</italic>, which are involved in dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis, the major LPS monosaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Balsanelli1">[19]</xref>. Mutation in the <italic>rfb</italic> genes drastically altered the composition of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> LPS, causing the modification of the whole molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Serrato1">[20]</xref>. Such rearrangements led to diminished attachment of the bacteria to maize roots, suggesting that interaction between LPS and plant receptors was required for adhesion onto roots. Mutations in lipid A biosynthesis genes are often lethal for gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Eidels1">[21]</xref>, while mutations in genes responsible for biosynthesis of monosaccharides can produce pleiotropic effects, such as decreased growth rate and altered exopolysaccharide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-OrmeoOrrilo1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Balsanelli1">[19]</xref>. In the present work, we showed activation of the expression of LPS biosynthesis gene <italic>waaL</italic> during colonization of maize root by <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>; we constructed a <italic>waaL</italic> (codes for the O-antigen ligase) mutant strain defective in the synthesis of the O-antigen portion of LPS, and showed that it is impaired in epiphytic and endophytic colonization. We have also isolated three N-acetyl glucosamine binding lectin-like proteins from maize roots (MRLs) and demonstrated their importance in LPS-dependent attachment of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> to maize and wheat roots.</p>

Inoculation of a mixture of both strains at a proportion of 1&#x2236;1 led to the recovery almost exclusively of the wild type.

On the other hand, wild-type colonization profile was not significantly different from that observed when it was the only strain inoculated.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Balsanelli1">[19]</xref> proposed that <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> LPS participates in the attachment of the bacteria by anchoring the bacterium to plant receptors by its N-acetyl glucosamine residues (28.2 mol % of O-antigen) and the results showed above reinforce the role of the O-antigen in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> maize interaction.

No difference in attachment was observed between treated and non-treated bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077001-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that bacterial external membrane proteins are not directly involved in <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment to maize. On the other hand, when maize roots were previously treated with proteinase K and then inoculated with <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> the bacterial attachment decreased by 100-fold, suggesting the involvement of a plant protein in the attachment process.

Attachment assays showed that <italic>A. brasilense</italic> population reaches the equilibrium at 10<sup>4</sup> cells per gram of root, while <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> showed a dose-dependent attachment pattern with maximum of 10<sup>7</sup> cells per gram of root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077001-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Co-inoculation assays revealed an outstanding reduction in attachment on both strains, suggesting a competition for binding onto maize root surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077001-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> number of attached cells was 100 to 1000-fold smaller in competition compared to isolated inoculation in all doses of inoculum. <italic>A. brasilense</italic>, on the other hand, was not recovered from root surface during competition when less than 10<sup>3</sup> cells were used in the inoculum, but showed no difference in attachment comparing to isolated inoculation in the bigger inoculum doses. These results suggest that the bacterial species initially compete for the same attachment sites, but when there are more bacteria <italic>A. brasilense</italic> is able to adhere normally. The addition of GlcNAc during the attachment assays of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077001-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) showed that <italic>A. brasilense</italic> attachment is blocked by this monosaccharide when less than 10<sup>4</sup> cells were used in the inoculum, and again showed no difference in attachment comparing to isolated inoculation in the bigger inoculum doses. The addition of GlcNAc during the competition assays between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077001-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) prevented completely attachment of <italic>A. brasilense</italic>. The attachment pattern of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> in the presence of GlcNAc was similar as in the separated inoculation as during competition with <italic>A. brasilense</italic>, suggesting that the competition for attachment between the species is due to sharing a conserved mechanism to bind to GlcNAc-plant receptors.</p>

On the other hand, cells attached to polypropylene spheres shows background &#x3B2;-galactosidase. The difference in &#x3B2;-galactosidase activities between cells attached to maize roots and to polypropylene spheres was about 10 times higher.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Attachment of soil bacteria to plant root cells is an early step required in associative interactions. We previously reported that intact LPS is required for <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment and endophytic colonization of maize roots, and suggested that it is necessary for the bacteria to bind to plant receptors and to resist plant chemical defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Balsanelli1">[19]</xref>. In the present study, we show that the presence of the O-antigen portion in the LPS is essential for an efficient bacterial colonization, a role supported by the induction of LPS biosynthesis gene expression during rhizoplane colonization. The results support the hypothesis that <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> uses LPS to attach or adhere to plant protein receptors possibly by recognition and binding to maize root lectins.</p>
      <p>Plant assays using a mutant in the O-antigen ligase gene (<italic>waaL</italic>) showed that <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> LPS O-antigen is necessary for an early epiphytic attachment and colonization. Moreover, impairment of the endophytic colonization caused by the lack of O-antigen was observed even ten days after inoculation. This may suggest an important role of LPS against plant basal defenses. In other rhizobacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens, Azospirillum brasilense</italic> and <italic>R. tropici</italic> CIAT899 alterations in the LPS structure also reduced rhizospheric and endophytic root colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Simons1">[15]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Jofr1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-OrmeoOrrilo1">[9]</xref>, but the role of LPS in such interactions is not clear.</p>
      <p>Our data suggests that bacterial surface proteins are not required for the initial attachment of <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> to maize roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077001-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), a role that seems fulfilled by the bacterial LPS. On the other hand, the presence of maize root surface proteins enhances <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment. Moreover, fractions containing three maize root lectin-like proteins recovered from a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-agarose column inhibited wild type <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment to maize roots. The WGA lectin also inhibited attachment of wild type <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> to maize and wheat plants, but not that of LPS mutant. We propose a model in which the N-acetyl glucosamine residues of the LPS O-antigen binds to the maize root lectins (MRL1, 2 and 3). Lectins exposed on root surfaces thus interact with bacteria in the rhizoplane due to their ability to distinguish between sugar moieties of bacterial polysaccharides.</p>
      <p>There are evidence indicating that symbiotic interaction between some rhizobia and plants may involve plant lectins and bacterial LPS. The peanut root lectin PRA II binds to the LPS from several strains of <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> sp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Jayaraman1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Bhattacharya1">[40]</xref>, and the PsNLEC-1 lectin-like protein from pea nodules binds to <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> 3841 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Bolaos1">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, this lectin also binds to <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> B551, <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> EFB1, but not to <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic> B659, a LPS defective mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Bolaos1">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The role of lectins in the interaction of gramineous plants with associative bacteria is poorly understood. Wheat germ agglutinin is present on surfaces of wheat seedlings and on root tips of adult wheat plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Mishkind1">[42]</xref>, and may therefore be a site for specific attachment of rhizobacteria contributing to bacterial adhesion to the root surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-DelGallo1">[43]</xref>. The previously uncharacterized maize GlcNAc-binding lectins identified in the present work have homologs in other grasses such as wheat, rice and sorghum, plants that are highly colonized by <italic>H. seropedicae</italic>. Indeed, lectins of several cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and rice, are related and can be inhibited by GlcNAc and its oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077001-Stinissen1">[44]</xref>. The competition assays between <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> and <italic>A. brasilense</italic> showed that different bacterial species containing N-acetyl glucosamine in the capsule polysaccharides compete to colonize maize roots (and probably other grasses), and that the structure of such polysaccharides may contribute in determining the specificity of plant-bacteria interactions. It is likely that the interaction between LPS O-antigen and the MRLs is a key step for the establishment of the bacteria onto the root enhancing <italic>H. seropedicae</italic> attachment and conferring a competitive advantage during colonization of root surfaces, to gain access to inner tissues.</p>
