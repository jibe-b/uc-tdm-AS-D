      <abstract>
        <p>Reduction in crop yield and quality due to various abiotic stresses is a worldwide phenomenon. In the present investigation, a heat shock factor (HSF) gene expressing preferentially in developing seed tissues of wheat grown under high temperatures was cloned. This newly identified heat shock factor possesses the characteristic domains of class A type plant HSFs and shows high similarity to rice OsHsfA2d, hence named as TaHsfA2d. The transcription factor activity of TaHsfA2d was confirmed through transactivation assay in yeast. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d not only possess higher tolerance towards high temperature but also showed considerable tolerance to salinity and drought stresses, they also showed higher yield and biomass accumulation under constant heat stress conditions. Analysis of putative target genes of AtHSFA2 through quantitative RT-PCR showed higher and constitutive expression of several abiotic stress responsive genes in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants over-expressing TaHsfA2d. Under stress conditions, TaHsfA2d can also functionally complement the T-DNA insertion mutants of AtHsfA2, although partially. These observations suggest that TaHsfA2d may be useful in molecular breeding of crop plants, especially wheat, to improve yield under abiotic stress conditions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plants are exposed to several environmental stresses during their life cycle that hampers their growth and development, resulting in considerable yield losses. Some of the common abiotic stresses that plants encounter are drought, flooding, salinity stress and extreme temperatures. As a consequence of a combination of different abiotic stresses, there is a dramatic yield loss in many crop plants. High temperature stress is one of the most severe stresses adversely affecting crop production worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Kurek1">[1]</xref>. However, morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes occur in some plant species, that enable them to survive under high temperature conditions. A common response to high temperature stress is the synthesis of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). HSP encoding genes are found to be under the control of Heat Shock Factors (HSF), transcription factors that regulate the expression of HSP genes. The number of HSFs differs in organisms, for example, while vertebrates have four, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and yeast have only one HSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nover1">[2]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nakai1">[3]</xref>. In plants, the numbers of HSFs are characteristically high, while <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has 21, rice 25, <italic>Brachypodium</italic> 24, soybean 52 and <italic>Poplar</italic> 27 members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nover2">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Scharf1">[6]</xref>. Plant HSFs are represented by conserved structural features such as presence of highly conserved N-terminal, helix turn helix type <underline>D</underline>NA <underline>b</underline>inding <underline>d</underline>omain (DBD), followed by an oligomerization domain composed of two hydrophobic heptad repeats (HR-A and HR-B) connected to DBD by a linker of 15&#x2013;80 residues and presence of nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nover2">[4]</xref>. In contrast to N-terminal architecture, the <underline>C</underline>-terminal <underline>t</underline>rans-activation <underline>d</underline>omain (CTD), possessing AHA motif, is less conserved in plants. Based on sequence homology and domain architecture, plant HSFs have been divided into three conserved classes. Type A HSFs are characterized by exclusive presence of AHA transactivator motif in their C-terminal trans-activation domain (CTD), whereas class B and class C HSFs do not possess a trans-activator domain. Class B HSFs have a longer HR-A/B region due to insertion of 21 and 7 residues, respectively, and are more similar to non-plant HSFs than class A and C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nover2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Kotak1">[7]</xref>. When exposed to heat stress, these HSFs form trimers and bind with high affinity to DNA at the heat stress elements (HSEs) in the promoter sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Taylor1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Mittal1">[9]</xref>. The functional HSE sequence is inverted repeats of 5&#x2019;-nGAAnnTTCn-3&#x2019; motif in promoters of the Hsp genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Schoffl1">[10]</xref>. In plants, HSF family has been described in detail in two model organisms, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nover2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Guo1">[11]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Guo2">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There is functional diversification found among different HSF members. HSFA1a is described as the master regulator in tomato for acquired thermotolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Mishra1">[13]</xref>. It forms a complex with other HSFs, A2 and B1, and thus regulates thermal response. Unlike tomato, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has four HsfA1 and, recently, Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Liu1">[14]</xref> developed a quadruple mutant to remove functional redundancy of all <italic>HsfA1</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. It was found that more than 65% heat shock up-regulated genes were <italic>HsfA1</italic> dependent and, apart from severely reduced thermo tolerance, the quadruple mutant was also defective in overall growth and development, thus confirming the role of HsfA1 as the master regulator. In another recent report, triple and quadruple mutants of 4 HsfA1-type proteins were generated and it was found that HS responsiveness of <italic>DREB2A</italic> disappeared, indicating again <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfA1 as the main positive regulator in HS-responsive gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Yoshida1">[15]</xref>. In a genome-wide expression analysis of Hsf gene family in rice, <italic>OsHsfA1</italic> showed a stable expression across 28 different tissues, representing major plant developmental stages and abiotic stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref>. Unlike HsfA1, HsfA2 is expressed only in heat-stress induced plants and functions as a regulator in other environment stresses as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nishizawa1">[16]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Ogawa1">[17]</xref>. HsfA2 is strongly induced upon heat stress in tomato, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Scharf2">[18]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Busch1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref> and is found to play a role during heat stress or in recovery after HS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Baniwal1">[20]</xref>. It has also been reported that under oxidative stress, 26 proteosome function and/or heat shock protein (HSP90) activity inhibits, which is a trigger for the HsfA2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-NishizawaYokoi1">[21]</xref>. HsfA2 is also considered as an important linker between heat and oxidative stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Li1">[22]</xref>. AtHsfA2 knockout mutants display reduction in basal and acquired thermotolerance as well as oxidative stress while, its overexpression leads to increased tolerance under both these stressed conditions. Schramm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Schramm1">[23]</xref> functionally validated the transcription activation potential of HsfA2 on GUS reporter construct containing target promoters and their deletion analysis to verify HsfA2 binding site. This heat inducible HsfA2, when overexpressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, shows more tolerance to anoxia and submergence stress as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Banti1">[24]</xref>. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing OsHsfA2e showed thermotolerance in cotyledons, rosette leaves, inflorescence stems and seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Yokotani1">[25]</xref>. Charng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Charng1">[26]</xref> reported direct evidence of the biological function of HsfA2 in sustaining the transcript level of HSP genes during prolonged heat stress and recovery. Further, Cohen-Peer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-CohenPeer1">[27]</xref> reported physical interaction of AtHsfA2 and AtSUMO1, which represses its transcriptional activity. Recently, the role of OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b has been implicated in <italic>OsClpB-cyt</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Singh1">[28]</xref>. Apart from heat stress, class A HSFs are also induced in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice by other abiotic stresses, such as cold, oxidative, salt and drought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Swindell1">[29]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Mittal2">[30]</xref>. In rice, <italic>spl17</italic> mutant defective in <italic>OsHsfA4d</italic>, leads to disease mimic spotted leaf phenotype under high temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Yamanouchi1">[31]</xref>. The only known HSF gene from wheat, Ta<italic>HsfA4a</italic> is involved in cadmium tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Shim1">[32]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, over-expression of HsfA4a lead to decreased expression of cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging ascorbate peroxidase and it was hypothesized that HSFs may act as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensors in the plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Davletova1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Miller1">[34]</xref>. In plants, class A HSFs have been characterized in more detail than class B and class C HSFs. Tomato HsfB1 is a transcription co-activator, functioning along with HsfA1 and hypothesized as an HS induced factor, essential for maintenance and restoration of housekeeping gene transcription during stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Bharti1">[35]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> HsfB1 is heat inducible among all five class B HSF, however, its over-expression had no effect on HSP induction and thermotolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Busch1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Prandl1">[36]</xref>. In rice also OsHsfB1, B2a and B2b were found responsive to heat and oxidative stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Mittal2">[30]</xref>. Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Kumar1">[37]</xref> suggested that class B HSFs act as negative regulator of biotic stress response, since down-regulation of class B Hsf resulted in increased expression of plant defense genes.</p>
      <p>Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world, and its complete genome has not been sequenced. Moreover, compared to rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there have been few studies investigating the stress response associated genes, especially heat stress related genes in wheat, partly because of its hexaploid nature, larger genome size and relatively longer life cycle. In the present investigation, the cloning of a seed preferential heat shock factor, identified through subtractive hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan2">[38]</xref> and its characterization in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants was undertaken.</p>

        <p>Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) cv. CPAN1676 and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotype Col0 were used throughout the present study. For seedling based studies, wheat plants were grown in plastic trays in a growth chamber (Conviron, Canada) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants were grown on half-strength MS medium in Petri plates at 20&#xB0;C and 16 hour photoperiod in daily cycle. For other stages of plant development, plants were grown in potted soil and Soilrite for wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> respectively. For stress treatments, plants were transferred to growth chambers set at specified temperatures, and heat stress provided for different time periods. After heat stress treatment, the control and stressed tissues were sampled, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2013;80&#xB0;C until RNA isolation. Remaining seedlings were transferred back to the growth chamber for recovery. For developing grains, potted wheat plants grown in departmental garden were transferred for two hours to the growth chambers maintained at 37&#xB0;C and 42&#xB0;C at 3,7, 14, 21 and 28 days after anthesis. Sampling of developing grains was done from spikes of control and stressed plants and developing seeds were stored at &#x2013;80&#xB0;C until RNA isolation. For germination assay under salt stress, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds were germinated on &#xBD; MS for control condition and &#xBD; MS supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl in Petri plates. For seedling response under salinity stress, salt stress was provided by immersing two-week-old seedlings in &#xBD; MS medium supplemented with 150 mM and 300 mM NaCl for stress conditions. Similarly, for drought stress experiment, the seeds were germinated on &#xBD; MS for control condition and &#xBD; MS supplemented with 300 mM of mannitol for water stress condition.</p>

        <title>Cloning of wheat HSF cDNA and genomic fragments</title>
        <p>Total RNA from developing wheat seeds was isolated as described by Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Singh2">[39]</xref>. For RACE-PCR, previously identified wheat EST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan2">[38]</xref> showing homology with rice HSF was used as a template for designing the primers. Both 5`and 3`RACE-PCR was performed using SMART&#x2122; RACE amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) as per the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The resultant PCR fragments were then cloned using pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA) and sequenced. For cloning of genomic fragment, primers were designed from cloned full-length cDNA and PCR was conducted by using wheat genomic DNA as template by using Long-PCR Enzyme mix (Fermentas, Lithuania). The PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and then sequenced.</p>

        <p>Twenty micrograms of total RNA from control and high temperature treated samples were resolved in 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). PCR-amplified cDNA fragment of EST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan2">[38]</xref> representing wheat Hsf was purified from agarose gel.

We checked the tissue specificity of this transcript by RNA gel blot analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows that this wheat Hsf is expressed only in developing seed tissues and absent from shoot and root tissues. Although, a significant amount is also present in the control tissue, its transcript was further enhanced by heat stress at 37&#xB0;C and 42&#xB0;C. We then checked the inducibility of this gene at different stages of wheat grain development under control and heat stress conditions. This wheat Hsf is induced by heat stress in the early stages of seed development, and gradually become constitutive as the seed matures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

For this analysis, heat stress was given at 42&#xB0;C for 20 minutes only, as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> class A HSFs may have functional redundancy in activating these genes. The expression of 21 target genes was examined in three different tissues, viz. seedling, flower and siliques under normal growth conditions and on exposure to heat stress conditions in these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). These genes broadly represent different abiotic stress related genes, such as those coding for heat shock proteins (HSPs), reactive oxygen scavengers and secondary metabolites. The highest fold-change was observed for a chloroplast localized small heat shock protein (sHSP26.5); siliques showed the maximum expression, followed by seedling and flower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Almost similar expression pattern was observed in case of other organelle localized sHSPs, such as ER localized sHSP22 and mitochondria localized sHSP23.5. Many of the target genes showed higher expression in siliques tissues only, such as Sti1 which is exclusively present in siliques tissue. This can be explained by the fact that TaHsfA2d was primarily identified and cloned from developing wheat seed tissues. It is noteworthy that not all the target genes have higher expression in OE plants as compared to the WT plants such as HSP70B and GolS2, suggesting that these genes may not be the primary target of TaHsfA2d in wheat. Overall, mutant plants showed little or no expression under heat stress conditions in all the three tissues in terms of relative fold change; it was also reflected by their higher Ct values when compared to WT and OE plants in the assay (data not shown).</p>

        <title>TaHsfA2d can partially complement <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> KO <italic>hsfa2</italic> plants</title>
        <p>It is clearly evident from the above analysis, that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> KO plants for hsfa2 are defective in heat and salt stress response. Since TaHsfA2d showed 65% homology with AtHsfA2 at the amino acid level, we tried to complement the KO plants with wheat TaHsfA2d. The complemented plants performed better than KO plants in all the experiments conducted in the present study and their response was almost at par with the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g004">Fig. 4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g008">8</xref>). However, we expected these plants to perform better than WT plants as the expression of the transgene, <italic>TaHsfA2d</italic> is governed by a strong, constitutive promoter CaMV35S. The partial recovery displayed by these complemented KO plants can be explained on the basis of relatively lower expressions of the target genes in transgenics as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>. Almost all the genes showed a lower expression in terms of relative fold change than the corresponding WT and OE tissue. One exception to this is the expression of <italic>Sti</italic> gene in silique tissue. This discrepancy in the expression values of WT and complemented KO plants can be explained by the possible different target gene specificities of TaHsfA2d, as the wheat <italic>TaHsfA2d</italic> expresses preferentially in seed and its transcript levels increase substantially by high temperature treatment in seed tissues.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Heat shock factors have been functionally analyzed in many plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, tomato and sunflower [4, 20, 25, 31, and 44]. However in wheat, only one heat shock factor, TaHsfA4d, has been functionally characterized so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Shim1">[32]</xref>. In this study, we cloned and characterized a class A Hsf from wheat, TaHsfA2d, from developing wheat seeds. Through northern analysis we found that this Hsf is seed specific. Although, previous expression analysis based on EST showed that TaHsfA2d is heat inducible in both shoot and roots, nevertheless, the expression of TaHsfA2d was much higher in flower and developing seed under heat stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan2">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, in our previous study we have shown that among various class A HSFs in rice, <italic>OsHsfA2d</italic> also showed induced expression in developing rice seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref>. Apart from heat stress, we found that TaHsfA2d is also inducible by salt stress and by ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan2">[38]</xref>. Further, we demonstrate in this study that this TaHsfA2d functions as the transcriptional activator in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Unlike class B and class C Hsfs, class A Hsfs are known to be trans-activators due to the presence of AHA motif. We found that TaHsfA2d has a functional AHA motif and acts as trans-activator similarly to other class A Hsfs.</p>
      <p>There <italic>are</italic> 21 Hsfs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 25 in rice and 24 in <italic>Brachipodium</italic>, thus we expect 70&#x2013;75 Hsfs in wheat owing to its hexaploid nature and presence of three homeologous genomes. While both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato have a single HsfA2, rice has as many as 5 different HsfA2 (a-e) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nover2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Guo2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Mittal2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Liu2">[45]</xref>. In both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato, HsfA2 is highly inducible by abiotic stresses and constitutive up-regulation of this single Hsf in transgenic plants improved the tolerance to high temperature, while its down regulation showed the negative effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Mishra1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Li1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Charng1">[26]</xref>. Especially in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, overexpression of AtHsfA2 increased tolerance to several types of environmental stresses, such as high temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Busch1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Li1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Schramm1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Charng1">[26]</xref>, oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nishizawa1">[16]</xref> and anoxia stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Banti1">[24]</xref>. In rice also, different HsfA2 were found to be heat inducible and in addition, OsHsfA2d expressed in developing seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan1">[5]</xref>. Overexpression of OsHsfA2e increases the heat and salinity stress tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Yokotani1">[25]</xref>. In the present investigation, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d showed remarkable tolerance to moderate high temperature provided continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g006">6</xref>). This could be due to the constitutive expression of several abiotic stresses related genes in the transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). It has been shown earlier that overexpression of AtHsfA1a and A1b improved basal thermotolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Lee1">[46]</xref>. In the present study, a positive effect was also found on seed yield and silique length as well as silique number under moderate heat stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). It is known that many heat shock proteins are accumulated during seed maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Wehmeyer1">[47]</xref>. We also found higher expression of some HSPs in the siliques of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>) such as HSP 26.5P, HSP 101, HSP70-T2, HSP 23.6-M and HSP17. Kotak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Kotak2">[48]</xref> found that accumulation of HSPs in developing seeds is regulated by AtHsfA9 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Whether TaHsfA2d also governs accumulation of HSPs in wheat developing grains remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Overexpression of TaHsfA2d in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also increased plant tolerance against salinity and drought stress, as reflected by better germination, higher chlorophyll retention and biomass accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g007">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g008">8</xref>). This can again be explained by the constitutive expression of several salt/osmotic stresses related genes in transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Sun1">[49]</xref> reported that overexpression of molecular chaperon HSP17.7CII increased salt and osmotic stress tolerance. Overexpression of GolS1 increased water stress tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> through accumulation of higher amounts of raffinose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Taji1">[50]</xref>. In rice, it has been shown that myo-inositol 1-P-synthase (MIPS) gene has important protective functions under salinity stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-RayChaudhuri1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Dastidar1">[52]</xref>. We have recently found that in heat stress also, the levels of myo-inositol increase significantly and which is also correlated well with <italic>TaMIPS</italic> expression in wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Khurana1">[53]</xref>. It is therefore likely that salinity stress tolerance showed by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d is due to higher expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
      <p>Target genes for HsfA2 were identified through microarray analysis in transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Nishizawa1">[16]</xref> and rice HsfA2e <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Yokotani1">[25]</xref>. It has been found that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HsfA2 governs expression of 46 genes, which were constitutively expressed in transgenic plants. Similarly, 37 genes were constitutively up-regulated in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing rice OsHsfA2e. There is a fair similarity in the diversity of genes governed by these two Hsf A2. On the basis of these reports we checked the expression of 21 target genes of HsfA2. These genes mainly represent heat shock proteins, reactive oxygen scavengers and other stress related proteins. We found that 16 out of 21 genes examined, have constitutively higher expression in seedling, flower and siliques of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d. A chloroplastic sHSP gene showed remarkably high expression in all the tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079577-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Recently, we have shown that over-expression of a wheat chloroplastic sHSP26 improves photosynthetic efficiencies under heat stress conditions in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants and also take part in seed development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan3">[54]</xref>. It is worth mentioning here that in our previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079577-Chauhan2">[38]</xref>, we reported many seed specific genes induced by heat stress, are also constitutively expressed in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants over-expressing TaHsfA2d, such as <italic>sHSPs, HSP70, HSP101</italic> and <italic>Sti</italic>. It is therefore likely that heat, drought and salt stress tolerance of the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d is provided by constitutive expression of these stress related genes.</p>
      <p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d, which preferentially expresses in developing wheat grains, showed improved heat and salt stress tolerance at various growth stages, and higher yields under moderate heat stress conditions. These findings suggest that TaHsfA2d gene may be useful in molecular breeding of wheat for enhanced thermotolerance especially during terminal heat stress.</p>
