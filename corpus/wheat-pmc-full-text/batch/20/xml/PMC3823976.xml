      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is a plant pathogen infecting several important cereals, resulting in substantial yield losses and mycotoxin contamination of the grain. Triazole fungicides are used to control diseases caused by this fungus on a worldwide scale. Our previous microarray study indicated that 15 ABC transporter genes were transcriptionally upregulated in response to tebuconazole treatment. Here, we deleted four ABC transporter genes in two genetic backgrounds of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> representing the DON (deoxynivalenol) and the NIV (nivalenol) trichothecene chemotypes. Deletion of <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic> belonging to group I of ABC-G and to group V of ABC-C subfamilies of ABC transporters, respectively, considerably increased the sensitivity to the class I sterol biosynthesis inhibitors triazoles and fenarimol. Such effects were specific since they did not occur with any other fungicide class tested. Assessing the contribution of the four ABC transporters to virulence of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> revealed that, irrespective of their chemotypes, deletion mutants of <italic>FgABC1</italic> (ABC-C subfamily group V) and <italic>FgABC3</italic> were impeded in virulence on wheat, barley and maize. Phylogenetic context and analyses of mycotoxin production suggests that <italic>FgABC3</italic> may encode a transporter protecting the fungus from host-derived antifungal molecules. In contrast, <italic>FgABC1</italic> may encode a transporter responsible for the secretion of fungal secondary metabolites alleviating defence of the host. Our results show that ABC transporters play important and diverse roles in both fungicide resistance and pathogenesis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight (FHB), caused by a number of closely related species including <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> Schwabe (teleomorph <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic> (Schwein.) Petch), is a major disease of wheat and other small-grain cereals. These fungi can cause considerable economic losses not only due to diminishing yield and quality of the harvest but also because of the production of mycotoxins in infected grains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher1">[1]</xref>. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the most important mycotoxins are B-trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV), but also zearalenone (ZEN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Stepien1">[2]</xref>. Infection of cereals leading to contamination of food and feed with these mycotoxins poses a health risk to consumers. The major sources of inoculum in FHB are ascospores produced by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> growing saprophytically on cereal debris. After expulsion from the perithecium, airborne ascospores infect wheat heads. Infection occurs most effectively at the stage of anthesis. Some FHB-causing fungi including <italic>F. graminearum</italic> may infect cereals at other developmental stages resulting in seedling blight, foot, crown or root rots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Control of FHB includes agronomic practices such as appropriate crop rotation, tilling and fungicide application, and the utilisation of resistant cultivars. Management practices integrating several control measures performed better than the application of measures separately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Willyerd1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Blandino1">[4]</xref>. In North America and Europe, the preferred fungicides to control FHB are triazoles such as tebuconazole, prothioconazole and metconazole, all of which are sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBI) class I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Paul1">[5]</xref>. Recently, declining efficacies of these fungicides was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Klix1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Yin1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our previous work, we investigated the capability of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to develop resistance to azoles and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Cultivation of strain NRRL 13383 in the presence of a sublethal concentration of tebuconazole allowed to recover isolates with enhanced tolerance to that fungicide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher2">[8]</xref>. Transcriptome analysis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> challenged with tebuconazole <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref> showed strong responses for some genes of the sterol biosynthesis pathway, noticeably <italic>FgCyp51A</italic> to <italic>FgCyp51C</italic> encoding cytochrome P450 sterol 14&#x3B1;-demethylase, which is the molecular target of azoles. Furthermore, 15 out of 54 genes encoding ABC transporters were more than twofold upregulated by tebuconazole treatment. Functional proof for a contribution of CYP51 to azole resistance in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was provided by deletion analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Liu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Fan1">[11]</xref>. It is however uncertain whether mutations in any of the three <italic>Cyp51</italic> genes or changes in their regulation cause increased azole tolerance in field strains.</p>
      <p>In addition to CYP51, membrane-bound transporters affect the sensitivity of fungal pathogens to azoles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Cannon1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher4">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-DeWaard1">[14]</xref>. Contribution of these proteins to azole resistance in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> has not been shown before. Taking advantage of our previous transcriptome analysis, we have chosen in this study four genes encoding ABC transporters for functional analyses. We deleted these genes to determine their contribution to fungicide resistance, virulence and mycotoxin production.</p>

        <p>The strains <italic>F. graminearum</italic> PH1 and NRRL 13383 used in this study, as well as the procedures used for their growth, sporulation and storage were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Vegetative growth rates were determined on PDA plates (&#xD8; 90 mm) at 15&#xB0;C, 23&#xB0;C and 30&#xB0;C. Mycelial plugs (&#xD8; 5 mm) taken from margins of colonies grown on PDA at 23&#xB0;C for five days were used for inoculation. Two perpendicular measurements of colony diameters were taken during seven days and averaged. Each variant was replicated four times.</p>
        <p>The capacity of fungal strains to produce macroconidia was determined in 50 ml Mung Bean Broth (MBB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Bai1">[15]</xref> in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks inoculated with five mycelial plugs per flask as above. Cultures were incubated at 23&#xB0;C with 100 rpm for 7 days. Conidia were harvested by filtering through Miracloth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and collected by centrifugation at 3000&#xD7;g for 10 min. Conidial density was determined using a haemacytometer (Brand, Wertheim, Germany). Each strain was grown in four cultures and conidia were counted twice. Statistical significances were determined by T-test (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) as implemented in the Microsoft Excel 2010 software.</p>
        <p>Germination efficiency of macroconidia was determined on glass slides inoculated with 20 &#xB5;l of a conidial suspension (10<sup>4</sup> ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), covered with a cover glass and incubated on three layers of moistened paper towels inside a 120&#xD7;120&#xD7;17 mm plastic dish (Greiner Bio-One, Solingen, Germany) at 23&#xB0;C for 24 h under illumination with near-UV light (L18W/73, Osram, Munich, Germany). Germinated and ungerminated conidia were counted twice in four replicates per strain. Statistical analysis was carried out as described above.</p>

        <p>The isolation of fungal genomic DNA and total RNA followed published methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>. Cultivation and treatment of mycelia with tebuconazole, preparation and validation of RNA, RT-qPCR and data analysis were performed as outlined previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>. Each variant was represented by four biological replicas (RNAs from independent cultures), each of which was analysed twice by RT-qPCR.

        <title>Generation and Validation of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> Transformants</title>
        <p>For the preparation of protoplasts, 5&#xD7;10<sup>6</sup> macroconidia were incubated for 12 h in 100 mL of YEPD at 28&#xB0;C and 175 rpm. The mycelium was recovered on a sterile paper filter and then incubated for 4 h at 30&#xB0;C and 90 rpm in 20 ml of protoplasting mix (500 mg driselase, 1 mg chitinase, 100 mg lysing enzyme of <italic>Trichoderma harzianum</italic> (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) in 1.2 M KCl). Protoplasts were harvested at R.T. by centrifugation at 1000&#xD7;g and suspended in 1 mL STC buffer (1.2 M sorbitol, 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). A transformation reaction contained 10<sup>7</sup> protoplasts in 100 &#xB5;L STC buffer, 50 &#xB5;L 30% PEG 8000 and 8 &#xB5;g DNA of the deletion construct in 50 &#xB5;L water. After incubation for 20 min at RT and 50 rpm, 2 mL 30% PEG 8000 and 5 min later 4 mL STC buffer were added. Aliquots of 600 &#xB5;L were mixed with 15 mL molten regeneration medium (275 g of sucrose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 0.5 g casein hydrolysate, 5 g of agar per litre) and poured into a Petri dish. After incubation for 12 h at 26&#xB0;C, 15 mL of molten regeneration medium containing, depending on the marker gene used for selection, either hygromycin B, nourseothricin or G418 at concentrations of 200 &#xB5;g/mL, were poured onto the surface of the agar. Colonies that started emerging after 4 d were harvested to obtain single spore isolates as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher2">[8]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Transformants were analysed by PCR and Southern hybridisation. Probes for the latter were generated with the PCR DIG Labeling Mix<sup>PLUS</sup> kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Bioluminescence was visualized by exposing Nylon membranes to Hyperfilm ECL X-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, USA).</p>

        <title>Determination of Sensitivity to Fungicides and Plant Metabolites</title>
        <p>The sensitivity of transformants to fungicides and plant compounds was tested on PDA plates (12&#xD7;12 cm, Greiner Bio-One) amended with appropriate concentrations of a given substance. For each compound, we used three concentrations that were optimized in preliminary experiments. The following fungicides were obtained as commercial formulations: azoxystrobin (Amistra, BASF), fenpropimorph (Corbel, BASF), metconazole (Caramba, BASF), prochloraz (Sportak, BASF) and tebuconazole (Folicur, Bayer). Pure active compounds epoxyconazole, fenarimol, spiroxamine, boscalid and dithianon were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany), except for prothioconazole, which was kindly provided by Bayer. Tolnaftat (Sigma-Aldrich) was included as a control xenobiotic that has never been used in agriculture. Sensitivity of fungal strains against plant secondary metabolites 2-benzoxazolinone (&#x200A;=&#x200A;BOA), 3-(dimethylaminomethyl)indole (&#x200A;=&#x200A;gramine), 2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 4&#x2032;,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone (&#x200A;=&#x200A;naringenin) and 3,3&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone dihydrate (&#x200A;=&#x200A;quercetin) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was tested in the same way. For all substances, stock solutions were prepared in DMSO; the final concentration of the solvent in culture media was at most 0.3%. Two &#xB5;L of a suspension of macroconidia (1&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup> mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) were used as inoculum to assess the effect of the compounds on germination. Mycelial plugs on unamended PDA were used as inoculum to determine the effect of the compounds on vegetative growth. At least three plates were used for each compound and concentration. Incubation was carried out in the dark at 23&#xB0;C for strains derived from NRRL 13383 and at 30&#xB0;C for strains with PH-1 background. Colony area was determined on digital photographs using ImageJ software version 1.46 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html</ext-link>).

        <title>Wheat Ear Infection Assay</title>
        <p>Cultivation of wheat in the greenhouse and environmentally controlled growth chambers and ear inoculation was described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher2">[8]</xref>. Shortly, <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strains were point-inoculated into the 9<sup>th</sup> spikelet of wheat cultivar Kadrilj (SW Seed Hadmersleben, Hadmersleben, Germany) when it reached anthesis.

        <title>Targeted Deletion of ABC Transporter Genes <italic>FgABC1</italic>, <italic>FgABC2</italic>, <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic></title>
        <p>We chose four genes encoding ABC transporters, which were previously found upregulated in strain PH-1 after tebuconazole treatment, for targeted deletion mutagenesis. These genes clustered in three ABC subfamilies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>. ABC transporters have been classified according to several schemes. Using one that was based on the yeast nomenclature classified FgABC1 (FGSG_10995) and FgABC4 (FGSG_17058) into the MRP (multidrug resistance-related protein) subfamily, FgABC3 (FGSG_04580) into the PDR (pleiotropic drug resistance) subfamily and FgABC2 (FGSG_17046) into a distinct unnamed clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>. Applying an alternative classification scheme, which was originally used to classify human ABC transporters, FgABC1 and FgABC4 were assigned to subfamily ABC-C group V, FgABC3 to subfamily ABC-G group I and FgABC2 to subfamily ABC-A group I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kovalchuk1">[23]</xref>. Since expression of these four genes was previously only analysed in strain PH-1, we determined their transcript levels by RT-qPCR in strain NRRL 13383 after a 12 h treatment with 5 ppm tebuconazole. In comparison to untreated controls, the transcript levels of <italic>FgABC1</italic>, <italic>FgABC2</italic>, <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic> were increased 3.0-, 3.1-, 3.4- and 3.9-fold, respectively. The transcriptional responses of strain NRRL 13383 were thus similar to those previously observed in strain PH-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>, except for gene <italic>FgABC4</italic>, which responded stronger in PH-1 (10.6-fold). We introduced deletions of these four genes into both strains, i.e. NRRL 13383 and PH-1, which have the NIV and the 15ADON chemotypes, to examine whether any of the resulting phenotypes may occur independently from the genetic background of the host used for transformation including its chemotype.</p>
        <p>DNA cassettes, which comprised a dominant resistance marker gene for an antibiotic controlled by a heterologous promoter and the left and right flanks of the targeted genes, were transformed into both strains, i.e. PH-1 and NRRL 13383 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Single spore isolates were analysed by PCR and Southern hybridisation for the mode of DNA integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Several transformants containing the resistance cassette integrated by a double-cross-over event at the targeted locus (type III integration according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Fincham1">[24]</xref>) were obtained for each gene and recipient strain.</p>

        <title>Vegetative Fitness and Fungicide Sensitivities of the Deletion Mutants</title>
        <p>We assessed whether the deletion of a given ABC transporter gene would impair the resulting transformants with respect to vegetative growth and asexual reproduction. For each deletion, we examined growth rates on PDA at three temperatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) and quantified the formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) and the germination of macroconidia <italic>in vitro</italic> in two transformants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). None of the deletions led to any significant change in any of the three attributes. This was true for the transformants in the PH-1 and the NRRL 13383 backgrounds.</p>
        <p>We determined the impact of 11 fungicides belonging to the chemical groups of anthraquinones, imidazoles, methoxy-acrylates, morpholines, pyridine-carboxamides, pyrimidines, spiroketal-amines and triazoles on germination and vegetative growth of the transformants. In the background of NRRL 13383, we observed significantly reduced tolerance in &#x394;<italic>FgABC3</italic> strains for the triazoles tebuconazole, prothioconazole and epoxyconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079042-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Similarly, &#x394;<italic>FgABC4</italic> mutants were significantly less tolerant for the latter two. In addition, both of these deletions led to significantly reduced tolerance against fenarimol, which has the same target as the triazoles (SBI class I) but is a pyrimidine. There existed no significantly changed sensitivities against fungicides grouped into SBI class II, QoI, SDHI, anthraquinone and N-phenyl carbamate, as well as tolnaftat. The deletion of the same four ABC transporter genes in the PH-1 background affected the resulting mutants in a similar way as in NRRL 13383. However, the reductions in tolerance to the above-mentioned fungicides were less severe so that in some cases these trends were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079042-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Deletion of the genes <italic>FgABC1</italic> and <italic>FgABC2</italic> did not significantly reduce the tolerance levels for any fungicide in any of the two backgrounds. The impact of the SBI class I fungicides prothioconazole and fenarimol on vegetative hyphae was observed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). In untreated control cultures, hyphal morphology of all mutants resembled that of the wild type strains. In contrast, treatment with 3 ppm of either fungicide induced aberrant hyphal morphology in &#x394;<italic>FgABC3</italic> and &#x394;<italic>FgABC4</italic> mutants, but not in the WT and in &#x394;<italic>FgABC1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>FgABC2</italic> mutants. Such hyphae appeared thicker and had swellings that emerged throughout the mycelium, but most often apically. Occasionally, such structures collapsed. These effects resembled those reported previously for tebuconazole treatment of <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic>

        <title>Effects of Deletions on Fungicide Sensitivity</title>
        <p>Our study shows that the deletion of <italic>FgABC3</italic> and of <italic>FgABC4</italic> caused enhanced sensitivity to several triazoles and to fenarimol that are classified as SBI class I fungicides. These effects are rather specific since such deletion mutants do neither suffer from general fitness impairment nor do they show increased sensitivity against other fungicide classes. Considering that the genome of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> comprises 54 genes putatively encoding ABC transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>, it is notable that single deletions already yielded this phenotype. In addition to <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic>, the PDR and the MRP subfamilies harbour additional genes that also responded to tebuconazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>. This could suggest that distinct transcriptional responses only occurring for <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic> may not explain why similar paralogs were not able to complement the deletions. Nonetheless, our RT-qPCR analyses revealed for two of the four genes, <italic>FgABC1</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic>, a loss of transcriptional upregulation, which occurs in the wild type, in response to triazole, if any of the other three genes studied was deleted. In triazole-treated &#x394;<italic>FgABC3</italic> mutants, transcript levels of <italic>FgABC4</italic> were significantly lower than those of the fungicide-treated wild type. As shown above, <italic>FgABC4</italic> is needed to maintain wild type levels of fungicide tolerance. Thus, the reduced sensitivity in the &#x394;<italic>FgABC3</italic> mutants might have been indirectly caused by the decrease of <italic>FgABC4</italic> transcript levels. However, this is unlikely because also the deletion of <italic>FgABC1</italic> analogously affected the transcript levels of <italic>FgABC4</italic>. Conversely, such mutants were similar to the wild type with respect to fungicide sensitivity. Therefore, the reduction in triazole tolerance seen in the mutants of <italic>FgABC3</italic> is mainly resulting from the deletion of that gene. Another explanation why similar paralogs were not able to complement adequately the deletions of <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic> could be the existence of distinct post-transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, the transporters missing in the deletion mutants could have distinct substrate specificities that only poorly matched those of other transporters.</p>
        <p>Typically, fungal ABC transporters known to mediate fungicide resistance belong to the PDR (ABC-G) and the MDR (ABC-B) and to a lesser extent to the MRP (ABC-C) subfamilies. PDR transporters, whose contribution to azole resistance had been analysed in detail, are for example CDR1 and CDR2 in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and PDR5 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Prasad1">[27]</xref>. Like FgABC3, these proteins belong to group I in the ABC-G subfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kovalchuk1">[23]</xref>. In contrast to human pathogens, far fewer functional genetic analyses have been performed for PDR transporters potentially mediating azole resistance in plant pathogenic fungi. Disruption mutants of <italic>PMR1</italic> (ABC-G group I) in <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic>, a pathogen of citrus, exhibited increased sensitivity to azoles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Nakaune1">[28]</xref>. By employing gene replacement and overexpression in <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, a necrotroph with a wide host range, BcAtrD (ABC-G group I) was shown to mediate azole resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Hayashi1">[29]</xref>. <italic>ShAtrD</italic>, a homolog of <italic>BcAtrD</italic>, was found to be overexpressed in azole resistant field isolates of <italic>Sclerotinia homoeocarpa</italic> causing dollar spot disease of turf grasses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Hulvey1">[30]</xref>. In <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic>, a pathogen infecting leaves of wheat, several ABC transporters were functionally analysed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Zwiers1">[31]</xref>. Heterologous expression of <italic>MgAtr1</italic> (ABC-G group III), <italic>MgAtr2</italic> (ABC-G group I) and <italic>MgAtr4</italic> (ABC-G group I) in a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutant with deletions of six ABC transporter genes resulted in increased tolerance against azoles. However, when the genes <italic>MgAtr1</italic> to <italic>MgAtr5</italic> were deleted individually in <italic>M. graminicola</italic>, no change in azole sensitivity was observed, possibly because of redundant substrate specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Zwiers1">[31]</xref>. At the moment, it is uncertain whether FgABC3 and FgABC4 possess very distinct substrate specificities that do not overlap sufficiently with those of other ABC transporters to allow for a compensation of the observed fungicide phenotype.</p>

        <title>Effects of Deletions on Virulence and Mycotoxin Production</title>
        <p>Interestingly, in addition to fungicide tolerance, the deletion of <italic>FgABC3</italic> reduced the virulence on wheat and barley heads but also maize stems, suggesting an important role of the encoded protein, and thus of the molecules transported by it, during pathogenesis. The biological roles of several transporters in the PDR subfamily have been studied earlier. This applies for <italic>FgABC3</italic> that was previously identified in a microarray analysis as a down-regulated gene (<italic>FgZRA1</italic>) in a deletion mutant of <italic>FgZEB2</italic> (FGSG_02398) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Lee1">[32]</xref>. <italic>FgZEB2</italic> encodes a transcription factor regulating the gene cluster for zearalenone biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kim1">[33]</xref>. Deletion mutants of <italic>FgZRA1</italic> (&#x200A;=&#x200A;<italic>FgABC3</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;FGSG_04580) accumulated less ZEN in liquid medium as well as in the mycelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Lee1">[32]</xref>. The authors discussed that FgZRA1 is unlikely to export ZEN. The effect of <italic>FgZRA1</italic> deletion on ZEN production could not be explained, its role in fungicide sensitivity and virulence was not investigated. Other reports indicated that deletion mutants for the genes involved in ZEN biosynthesis were causing the same levels of FHB on wheat and barley as the wild type strains, suggesting that ZEN is dispensable for virulence on these hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kim1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Gaffoor1">[34]</xref>. In contrast to that earlier study on <italic>FgZRA1</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Lee1">[32]</xref>, our analysis did not show reduced ZEN levels in the deletion mutants of <italic>FgABC3</italic> in any of the two backgrounds studied. Differences in the genetic backgrounds and/or culture conditions between the two studies may account for this discrepancy. On the other hand, an involvement of PDR subfamily transporters in pathogenesis was demonstrated in several cases. MgAtr4 of <italic>M. graminicola</italic> is needed to attain full virulence on wheat and it was proposed that it may protect the pathogen against host defence molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Stergiopoulos1">[35]</xref>. Similarly, BcAtrB (ABC-G group V), was described to protect <italic>B. cinerea</italic> against the phytoalexins resveratrol in grapevine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Schoonbeek1">[36]</xref> and camalexin in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Stefanato1">[37]</xref>. In <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, a hemibiotrophic pathogen of rice, the most similar protein to FgABC3 is MoABC1 (ABC-G group I). The deletion of <italic>MoABC1</italic> yielded mutants that were severely reduced in virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Urban1">[38]</xref>. Again, it was suggested that MoABC1 might protect the invading fungus from plant defence molecules. Later research detected a subclade within the ABC-G subfamily group I, which is distinctive to <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Coleman1">[39]</xref>. Functional characterisation of three members of this subclade, FcABC1 in <italic>F. culmorum</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Skov1">[40]</xref>, NhABC1 in <italic>Nectria haematococca</italic> (anamorph: <italic>F. solani</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Coleman1">[39]</xref> and GpABC1 in <italic>Gibberella pulicaris</italic> (anamorph: <italic>F. sambucinum</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Fleissner1">[41]</xref> demonstrated in all cases that the encoded proteins are essential for full virulence. It was shown for the latter two transporters that they are needed to protect the pathogen from phytoalexins of their hosts, i.e. pisatin and rishitin. In conclusion, considering the literature and the results of our ZEN measurements, we propose that the biological function of FgABC3 may rather be to export a host-derived defence compound than to export the fungal secondary metabolite ZEN. Our rationale is supported by the considerably decreased levels of virulence caused by &#x394;<italic>FgABC3</italic> mutants on all three hosts tested. A virulence defect is not expected if the function of FgABC3 would be to export ZEN, because as outlined above, ZEN does not contribute to virulence. Currently, the exported molecule remains unknown, since none of the cereal metabolites that we have tested showed noteworthy variation in their effect on deletion mutants and wild type strains. Published microarray data comparing the transcriptome of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> during FHB on wheat and barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Lysoe1">[42]</xref> show that <italic>FgABC3</italic> has the highest transcript levels among the four genes studied here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). In wheat, <italic>FgABC3</italic> transcripts peaked at 4 dpi, in barley they continuously increased until to the end of the experiment. This may indicate that FgABC3 is more important during late than early stages of infection.</p>
        <p>Deletion mutants of <italic>FgABC1</italic> were impeded in infections of wheat, barley and maize irrespective of their trichothecene chemotype. The phylogenetically most similar protein to FgABC1 is FgABC4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Becher3">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kovalchuk1">[23]</xref>; both of which are members of the MRP subfamily (ABC-C group V). Despite their similarity, deletion of <italic>FgABC4</italic> did not significantly affect virulence on any host tested, regardless of the chemotype. As outlined above, the opposite phenomenon was observed with respect to fungicide tolerance since the deletion of <italic>FgABC1</italic>, in contrast to <italic>FgABC4</italic>, did not cause changes compared to wild type strains, whereas deletion of <italic>FgABC4</italic> did so. Interrogation of published microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Lysoe1">[42]</xref> indicates that transcriptional patterns of the two genes during the infection of wheat and barley were quite similar and thus inappropriate to explain why <italic>FgABC4</italic> cannot functionally compensate the virulence defects of the <italic>FgABC1</italic> deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079042.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Other explanations for this failure are contrasting post-transcriptional regulation, contrasting substrate specificities leading to discrimination between the native substrates of the two transporters or different subcellular localisations. The latter appears however questionable since the softwares Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2/">http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2/</ext-link>) and YLoc Fungi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abi.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/Services/YLoc/webloc.cgi">http://abi.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/Services/YLoc/webloc.cgi</ext-link>) predicted for both transporters the plasma membrane as their most likely localisation (not shown).</p>
        <p>Transporters of the MRP subfamily (ABC-C) have been less studied than those in the PDR subfamily. Recently, in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> three members of this subfamily have been functionally characterised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kim2">[43]</xref>. Only the deletion of <italic>MoABC5</italic> resulted in reduced virulence on rice. The encoded protein belongs to ABC-C group V, which comprises only two members in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kovalchuk1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Aspergillus,</italic> several members in ABC-C group V seem to transport fungal secondary metabolites produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Kovalchuk1">[23]</xref>. <italic>FgABC1</italic> (FGSG_10995) resides in a supposed NRPS gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Zhang1">[44]</xref>. In a recent microarray study, this gene and the other members of the cluster were found upregulated during infection of wounded wheat coleoptiles. Individual deletions of three genes of the cluster that encoded the transporter, an NRPS and a putative peptidoglycan deacetylase yielded mutants that exhibited reduced virulence on wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Zhang1">[44]</xref>. Our &#x394;<italic>FgABC1</italic> mutants also showed strongly reduced virulence on wheat and furthermore on barley and maize. The effect on FHB in wheat was reminiscent, even though less severe, than that seen in &#x394;<italic>FgTri5</italic> mutants, which are unable to produce B-trichothecenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0079042-Jansen1">[45]</xref>. The latter were reported to remain restricted just to the initially infected spikelet. We observed often a similar effect in the background of NRRL 13383, which, however, is less aggressive on wheat than PH-1. In NRRL 13383, the &#x394;<italic>FgABC1</italic> mutants spread at most to two additional spikelets. Our mycotoxin analyses show that the production of trichothecenes is not impeded in the &#x394;<italic>FgABC1</italic> mutants. Therefore, the hitherto unknown secondary metabolites synthesized by the NRPS cluster, to which <italic>FgABC1</italic> belongs, are likely required for infection of wheat, barley and maize.</p>
        <p>We have functionally analysed the four ABC transporter genes in two genetic backgrounds, i.e. NRRL 13383 and PH-1, to assess whether the respective genomic context may influence the effect of gene deletion. Whereas deletion of <italic>FgABC3</italic> and <italic>FgABC4</italic> caused in NRRL 13383 significantly reduced tolerance to certain class I sterol biosynthesis inhibitors, this effect was somewhat less prominent in PH-1. Due to the lack of the genome sequence of NRRL 13383 it is unknown whether this strain has exactly the same set of ABC transporters as PH-1. Variations in their numbers, sequences and regulation could cause putative compensatory effects, although other reasons may apply. Nevertheless, our results show that alterations in fungicide sensitivities resulting from gene deletions may vary in their extents in different genomic contexts. In contrast, in the virulence tests we observed rather similar consequences of the deletions in NRRL 13383 and PH-1 indicating that the virulence defects observed in the &#x394;<italic>FgABC1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>FgABC3</italic> mutants do occur independently from the trichothecene chemotype, highlighting the importance of these genes for achieving full virulence on cereals.</p>
