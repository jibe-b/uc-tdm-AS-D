      <abstract>
        <p>The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in plant defense against pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, and bacteria. Actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are stimulus responsive actin cytoskeleton modulators. However, there is limited evidence linking ADFs with plant defense against pathogens. In this study, we have isolated and functionally characterized a stress-responsive ADF gene (<italic>TaADF3</italic>) from wheat, which was detectable in all examined wheat tissues. <italic>TaADF3</italic> is a three-copy gene located on chromosomes 5AL, 5BL, and 5DL. A particle bombardment assay in onion epidermal cells revealed the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of TaADF3. The expression of <italic>TaADF3</italic> was inducible by abscisic acid (ABA), as well as various abiotic stresses (drought and cold) and virulent <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>) but was down regulated in response to avirulent <italic>Pst</italic>. Virus-induced silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> copies enhanced wheat resistance to avirulent <italic>Pst</italic>, with decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and hypersensitive response (HR). Upon treatment with virulent <italic>Pst, TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants exhibited reduced susceptibility, which was accompanied by increased ROS production and HR. Interestingly, the silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> resulted in hindered pathogen penetration and haustoria formation for both avirulent and virulent <italic>Pst</italic>. Moreover, the array and distribution of actin filaments was transformed in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown epidermal cells, which possibly facilitated attenuating the fungus penetration. Thus, our findings suggest that <italic>TaADF3</italic> positively regulates wheat tolerance to abiotic stresses and negatively regulates wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> in an ROS-dependent manner, possibly underlying the mechanism of impeding fungal penetration dependent on the actin architecture dynamics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Actin is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. The dynamic reorganization and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is associated with various important cellular processes that are essential for cell growth, differentiation, division, membrane organization, motility, cold acclimation, and wound repair (Pollard et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Wasteneys and Galway, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Day et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Increasing evidence has shown that the actin cytoskeleton is precisely regulated to function as a contributing factor to plant immunity against pathogen ingress (Hardham et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tian et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Henty-Ridilla et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Pharmacological perturbation of the cytoskeleton compromised the basal defense and non-host resistance of a range of plants species by increasing the incidence of pathogen entry (Kobayashi et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1997a</xref>; Yun et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Shimada et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Miklis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton also plays a role in race-specific resistance (Skalamera and Heath, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Tian et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The actin-based cytoskeleton is modulated by a plethora of actin-binding proteins (ABPs), among which the actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) and the cofilins form a single family called the ADF/cofilins (Bamburg, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). They are abundant and essential in almost every eukaryotic cell type and are responsible for the high turnover rates of actin filaments <italic>in vivo</italic> (Staiger et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Dos Remedios et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Van Troys et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The interaction between actin and ADF/cofilins is controlled by reversible phosphorylation, ubiquitination, pH, oxidation, phosphoinositides, and specific proteins (Ayscough, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>Whereas most non-plant organisms contain only one or two genes encoding ADF proteins, plant species appear to express larger families of ADF genes (Meagher et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). In terms of phylogenetic relationships, plant ADF/cofilins are classified into at least four groups (Mun et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Group I is composed exclusively of dicots except for a rice ADF gene, whereas Group IV is proposed to be exclusive to the monocots (Danyluk et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Group II and Group III are expressed in both dicots and monocots, although Group II is pollen specific (Lopez et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Higher-plant ADFs exhibit specific temporal and spatial expression patterns, and the preferential tissue existence seems to be related to their distinct roles in different biological processes. Pollen-specific ADFs in Group II serve to bind and remodel F-actin in pollen grains in cooperation with other actin binding proteins (Lopez et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Allwood et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). ADFs in root hairs function to increase the turnover of actin filaments (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Dong et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In Arabidopsis, 12 ADFs in four ancient subclasses exhibit distinct tissue-specific and developmental expression and have been proposed to have different functions (Ruzicka et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The diverse expression patterns and functions of ADFs appear to co-evolve with the ancient and divergent actin isovariants.</p>
      <p>Corresponding to the regulatory role of the actin cytoskeleton in plants against various environmental stimuli, plant ADFs have been shown to play an important role in response to biological invasion and abiotic stress. ADFs from Arabidopsis, barley and wheat were found to be related to plant resistance to various pathogens (Miklis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tian et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Fu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The ectopic expression of barley <italic>HvADF3</italic> effectively impedes actin cytoskeleton integrity, thereby enhancing the susceptibility of the <italic>Mlo</italic> genotype to barley powdery mildew and partially breaks down <italic>mlo</italic> resistance with an elevated incidence of fungal entry (Miklis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The Arabidopsis AtADF4 is potentially targeted by the bacterial effector protein AvrPphB under the control of the cognate resistance gene RPS5-mediated resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (Porter et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). <italic>AtADF4</italic> mediated both effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) signaling due to its activity in actin rearrangement modulation or translocation of the cytoskeleton into the nucleus through the nuclear localization signal (NLS), where these triggers function as gene expression regulators (Tian et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Porter et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Henty-Ridilla et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In wheat, <italic>TaADF7</italic> contributes to resistance against <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>) by modulating the cytoskeleton dynamics to influence ROS accumulation and HR (Fu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). During cold acclimation, another wheat ADF protein, TaADF, accumulated to higher levels in freeze-tolerant but not sensitive wheat cultivars (Ouellet et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Ectopic overexpression of <italic>OsADF3</italic> conferred enhanced drought/osmotic stress tolerance on transgenic Arabidopsis by modulating several downstream abiotic stress-responsive target genes related to drought responses (Huang et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>As one of the top 10 plant-pathogenic fungi, <italic>Pst</italic> causes destructive wheat stripe rust disease worldwide (Dean et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In response to <italic>Pst</italic> infection, wheat shows race-specific resistance accompanied with hypersensitive response (HR), rapid cell death at neighboring mesophyll cells and infected sites. As <italic>Pst</italic> is an obligate biotrophic basidiomycete, which could not be cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, the wheat-<italic>Pst</italic> interaction mechanism has been largely hindered. The expanded understanding of the profound regulation of ADF/cofilins and the multifaceted functions of these ADF/cofilins in physiological changes has led to the conclusion that ADF/cofilin proteins are a functional node in cell biology (Bernstein and Bamburg, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Despite their multiple and essential roles, there is still limited evidence linking ADFs with host pathogen defense, especially in the wheat-<italic>Pst</italic> interaction phytosystem, except for <italic>TaADF7</italic> (Fu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Similar to the presence of 12 ADF genes in the entire rice and Arabidopsis genomes, the wheat genome also encodes a large ADF family consisting of multiple ADF genes. In this study, we isolated a novel ADF gene, <italic>TaADF3</italic>, that encodes a protein sharing only 57.55% similarity to TaADF7. To investigate the function of <italic>TaADF3</italic> in wheat, we analyzed its spatial and temporal expression patterns under various exogenous stresses. Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>TaADF3</italic> in wheat was performed to analyze whether and how <italic>TaADF3</italic> participates in wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>. Our results demonstrated that <italic>TaADF3</italic> positively regulates wheat tolerance to drought and cold, possibly by participating in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. Further silencing analyses revealed that <italic>TaADF3</italic> negatively regulated wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>, most likely by hindering fungus entry in an reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. These findings provide new insight into the role of ADFs in host immunity to biotrophic fungal pathogens.</p>

        <p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) genotype Suwon 11 and <italic>Pst</italic> pathotypes CYR23 and CYR31 were used for this study. Wheat cv. Suwon 11 contains the stripe rust resistance gene <italic>YrSu</italic> (Cao et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and is resistant to CYR23 but highly susceptible to CYR31. Wheat seedlings were grown, inoculated and maintained as described by Kang and Li (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). <italic>Pst</italic> pathotypes CYR23 and CYR31 were maintained on wheat cv. Mingxian 169 and Suwon 11, respectively. The fresh uredinospores of CYR23 and CYR31 were inoculated on the first leaves of wheat cv. Suwon 11 at the first leaf stage. Parallel mock control plants were inoculated with sterile water. After inoculation, plants were kept in a dark chamber with 100% humidity for 24 h and subsequently transferred to a growth chamber at 15&#xB0;C with a 16 h photoperiod under fluorescent white light. Wheat leaves were sampled at 0, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h post-inoculation (hpi).</p>
        <p>For chemical treatment, 2-week-old wheat seedlings were sprayed with 2 mM salicylic acid (SA), 100 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 100 mM ethepon, and 100 mM abscisic acid (ABA) dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) ethanol. Mock control plants were treated with 0.1% ethanol. The first leaves that were treated with chemicals along with the control plants were sampled at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-treatment (hpt). For various abiotic stresses, the roots of wheat seedlings were soaked in 200 mM NaCl or 20% PEG6000 for high salinity or drought treatment. To cause wounding, the first wheat leaves of 2-week-old seedlings were scraped with a sterilized needle. Low-temperature treatment was performed by transferring the wheat seedlings to a 4&#xB0;C chamber. The first leaves of the treated plants and mock control plants were collected at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpt. Intact tissues of different wheat organs from 2-week-old seedlings were collected for tissue-specific expression analysis, except for glume, which was collected at the adult stage of wheat seedlings.</p>
        <p>All the freshly collected samples were immediately frozen into liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C prior to the extraction of total RNA or DNA. For each time point, three independent biological replications were performed.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA of wheat leaves was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA from wheat leaves treated with chemicals, challenged by abiotic stresses and <italic>Pst</italic>, and different wheat tissues were extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I to remove the contaminating DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 &#x3BC;g of total RNA using the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The expression of the <italic>TaADF3</italic> gene was controlled using the wheat elongation factor <italic>TaEF-1</italic>&#x3B1; gene (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="Q03033">Q03033</ext-link>). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and the relative gene expression was quantified using the comparative 2<sup>&#x2212;&#x394;&#x394;CT</sup> method (Livak and Schmittgen, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).

        <p>Based on the EST sequence (TA54178_4565) in the TIGR Wheat Genome Database, a set of primers TaADF3-cDNA-F and TaADF3-cDNA-R were designed to amplify <italic>TaADF3</italic> from the cDNA of wheat leaves. The DNA sequence was obtained by genomic PCR using the total DNA of wheat leaves as the template. The physical characteristics of the deduced protein encoded by the obtained cDNA were computed using the Compute pI/MW Tool. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were conducted using DNAMAN and MEGA (version 4.0) software, respectively. The phylogram was constructed using the neighbor-joining method, in which bootstrap support values were based on 1000 replicates.</p>

        <p>For subcellular localization in onion cells, the TaADF3 protein-encoding sequence was amplified and inserted into the <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and <italic>Nco</italic>I sites of the <italic>pCaMV35S::GFP</italic> vector to generate the <italic>pCaMV35S::TaADF3-GFP</italic> fusion vector.</p>
        <p>The plasmids used for the silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> in the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)&#x2014;mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) experiment were constructed as described previously (Holzberg et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). A cDNA fragment derived from the coding sequence and the 3&#x2032; untranslated region (416&#x2013;592) was inserted into the <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Pac</italic>I sites to replace the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene fragment of &#x3B3;:<italic>PDS</italic> and generate the recombinant &#x3B3;:<italic>TaADF3</italic>. To guarantee the specificity of gene silencing, the cDNA sequence of <italic>TaADF3</italic> was aligned with the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv. Chinese Spring (CS) genome using the service provided by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository/BLAST">http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository/BLAST</ext-link>). The fragments that showed the highest polymorphism within the gene family and the lowest sequence similarity to other genes were chosen for constructing &#x3B3;RNA-based derivative plasmids.</p>

        <p>By <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using a high-yield capped RNA transcription kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE; Ambion), BSMV RNAs were prepared from linearized plasmids. For inoculation, the RNA transcripts were diluted four times, and 2.5 &#x3BC;L of each transcript, including the BSMV RNA &#x3B1;, &#x3B2;, and &#x3B3; (&#x3B3;-<italic>TaPDS</italic>, &#x3B3;-<italic>TaADF3</italic>) transcripts, were mixed with 42.5 &#x3BC;L of FES buffer (Pogue et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The mixture was inoculated into the second leaves of wheat seedlings at the two-leaf stage by gently rubbing the surface with a gloved finger (Scofield et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). BSMV: 00 and BSMV: <italic>TaPDS</italic> were used as controls for BSMV infection. Wheat seedlings inoculated with FES buffer were used as the mock controls. The virus-infected wheat seedlings were kept in a growth chamber at 25 &#xB1; 2&#xB0;C under a 16 h photoperiod. Ten days post BSMV inoculation, the fourth leaves were further inoculated with fresh uredinospores of <italic>Pst</italic> pathotype CYR23 or CYR31, and the plants were subsequently maintained as described above. Three independent sets of plants were prepared for each assay. The disease phenotype of the fourth leaves was observed and photographed 14 days post-inoculation of <italic>Pst</italic>.</p>

        <title>Histological observation of host defense and fungal growth in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants</title>
        <p>The defense response and fungal growth in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants were observed microscopically. For histological observation, leaf segments (1.5 cm in length) were fixed and decolorized in ethanol/ acetic acid (1:1 v/v). The specimens were cleared in saturated chloral hydrate until leaf tissue became translucent. The autofluorescence of the attacked mesophyll cells was observed under a fluorescence microscope (excitation filter 485 nm, dichromic mirror 510 nm, barrier filter 520 nm) and measured using DP-BSW software to determine the necrotic cell area. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that accumulated in the infection sites was stained using 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Amresco, Solon, OH, USA; Wang et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), viewed under differential interference contrast optics and measured using DP-BSW software. The infection structure of stripe rust fungus was stained by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as previously described (Ayliffe et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Leaf segements were autoclaved in 1 M KOH and 0.05% Silwet L-77 (Hood and Shew, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). After washing in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) twice, leaf tissue was stained with WGA-alexa (20 &#x3BC;g/ml) for 15 min. Then the tissues were rinsed with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and mounted in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) to be examined under blue light excitation. The hyphal length, haustoria, and infection area were observed and calculated using DP-BSW software. Only infection sites where substomatal vesicles had formed underneath stomata were considered to be successful penetration and were microscopically evaluated the infection hyphae, haustoria, and infection area. Penetration success was calculated as the number of infection sites that exhibited one or multiple haustoria in relation to the total number of infection sites. Standard deviations and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test were applied for statistical analysis.</p>

Ten days post-virus inoculation, the fourth leaves of the virus-infected plants were collected. The leaf segments (5 &#xD7; 5 mm in size) were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in 25 mM piperazine-N,N&#x2032;-bis (2-ethanesulfonic acid) buffer (PIPES, pH 6.8), with 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing in 25 mM PIPES and 25 mM phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 6.8), leaf segments were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 25 mM PBS (pH 6.8) at room temperature for 1 h. The specimens were washed with 25 mM PBS (pH 6.8), then with 25 mM PBS (pH 7.4) for three times. Then leaf segments were stained with Alexa-Fluor 488 phalloidin (0.66 &#x3BC;M in 25 mM PBS, pH 7.4). Vacuum infiltration was performed three times for 20 s at 27 mm Hg to promote uptake of the dye. Subsequently, samples were stored at room temperature for 3 h in darkness. Finally, leaves were rinsed with 25 mM PBS (pH 7.4), mounted in 25 mM PBS (pH 7.4) on glass slides and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Three biological replications were performed and approximately five leaf segments were observed for each repliation.</p>

        <title>TaADF3 encodes an actin depolymerizing factor</title>
        <p>Based on the EST sequence (TA54178_4565) in the wheat TIGR genome database, a cDNA fragment of 795 bp in length was obtained with an open reading frame (ORF) of 417 bp, which shows the highest similarity (97.83%) to the actin-depolymerizing factor 3 (GenBank no. <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="AIZ95472.1">AIZ95472.1</ext-link>) of <italic>T. aestivum</italic>. PCR amplification using the same primers obtained a genomic sequence of 1858 bp, consisting of three exons split by two introns with lengths of 972 bp and 91 bp. The first exon exclusively encodes the first start codon (methionine), typically found in ADF genes (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1</xref>). BlastN analyses in the <italic>T. aestivum</italic> cv. Chinese spring (CS) genome sequence showed that there are three copies of this gene in the wheat genome, located on the long arms of chromosomes 5A, 5B, and 5D (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1</xref>). The ADF gene obtained in this study and wheat actin-depolymerizing factor 3 in the NCBI Database exhibited the highest identity with the copies on chromosome 5BL and 5AL, respectively. The results indicate that these two genes are actually two homologous genes located on different chromosomes. Thus, here, we designated the ADF gene as <italic>TaADF3</italic>. The two copies of <italic>TaADF3</italic> on 5AL and 5DL encode the same protein, showing one residue variation from 5BL (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S2</xref>), although there were variations at 18 nucleotide positions in the open reading frames of the three copies (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The deduced TaADF3 protein encoded 138 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 16.10 kDa and an isoelectric point (PI) of 5.65. Multi-alignment of TaADF3 and ADFs from other higher plants revealed a preserved Ser6 in plant ADFs (Ser3 in animal) that could be phosphorylated. TaADF3 contained a bipartite NLS&#x2014;Lys22 and Arg28 close to the amino terminus; Ser6, Gly7, Arg97, Lys99, Asp124, and Glu127 could bind to actin monomers (G-actin); Lys81, Arg83, Glu135, and Arg136 could specifically bind to microfilaments (F-actin). A CAM combining region (Asp13&#x2014;Val42) and a PIP2 (phospholipid phosphatidylinositol -4, 5-bisphosphate) binding domain (Trp89&#x2014;Met100) were also included in the sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The results indicate the conservation of ADF proteins across different higher plant species.</p>

        <p>Based on the spatial and temporal expression pattern, the ADF proteins in higher plants were categorized into four groups. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S4</xref>, the majority of Group I ADF members are from dicotyledon plants, except for the ADF7 proteins from wheat, barley and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>. Group II contains pollen-specific ADFs, which can then be sub-grouped into the monocot group and the dicot group. Group III includes ADFs from both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. In contrast to the other groups, Group IV, to date, exclusively contains monocot ADFs and is most closely related to animal ADF/cofilins (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S4</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses showed that TaADF3 was homologous to rice OsADF4 and corn ZmADF3, with 67.63 and 62.59% similarity, respectively. In the phylogram, all of them belong to Group IV of the ADF/cofilin family.</p>

        <p>Considering the involvement of ADFs in the response to various abiotic stresses, we investigated the effects of exogenous hormone chemicals and abiotic stresses on the expression of <italic>TaADF3</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <italic>TaADF3</italic> was mainly induced by ABA treatment but showed no significant response to the other treatments.

        <title>Elevated defense response in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants</title>
        <p>Based on the observed enhanced resistance phenotype, the host response was further analyzed. We measured the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and necrotic cell death areas per infection site at 24, 48, and 120 hpi. In compatible interaction, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation mainly occurred in the guard cells in the early stage, and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> amount in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants was not affected (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). At 24 and 48 hpi, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> seldom occurred in mesophyll cells in mock control plants, which was also the case in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants at 24 hpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). However, at 48 hpi, 8.51% of the infection sites exhibited H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in attacked mesophyll cells when <italic>TaADF3</italic> was silenced, which was significantly higher than that in control plants (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S5A</xref>). Much more abundant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was accumulated in the attacked mesophyll cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Along with the increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 48 hpi, the occurrence of necrosis and the corresponding necrosis area were significantly elevated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S5B</xref>). At 120 hpi, in control plants, obvious accumulation was already observed, but significantly increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was accumulated in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). The necrotic cell death observed by auto-fluorescence exhibited a similar increased pattern to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To examine whether silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> affects the actin cytoskeleton in wheat cells, 10 days post-virus inoculation, the fourth leaves were sampled for Alexa-Fluor 488 phalloidin staining. Alexa-Fluor-stained actin filaments were observed in wheat epidermal cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A,B</xref>) and mesophyll cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C,D</xref>). In epidermal cells, the actin filaments were observed in two different array patterns, as thin filamentous structures arranged almost longitudinally or obliquely to the longitudinal axes of the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>), or formed parallel arrays arranged obliquely or transversely to the longitudinal axis of the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>). In BSMV:00 infected cells, the actin filamentous in 78.4% of the observed epidermal cells was arranged in the longitudinal array, only 21.6% in transversal array (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11E</xref>). In contrast, the transversely arranged actin filaments were observed in ~39.8% of the <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11E</xref>), almost one-fold higher than that in control cells. Besides, the actin filaments appear to be more abundant in transversal array.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ADFs are among the most highly expressed actin binding proteins that regulate actin dynamics. The four classified groups of ADFs in higher plants implies the functional divergence in the ADF family (Mun et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The specific existence of Group IV ADF members in monocot plants may suggest their distinct roles (Maciver and Hussey, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In this study, we isolated a wheat ADF gene, <italic>TaADF3</italic>, belonging to Group IV. The induced expression of <italic>TaADF3</italic> under PEG6000 treatment and low temperature indicated the involvement of <italic>TaADF3</italic> in enhancing plant acclimation to abiotic stresses. It has been reported that a wheat ADF member (TaADF) contributes to wheat cold acclimation regulated by genes located on chromosome 5A that are associated with cold hardiness (Ouellet et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In addition, TaADF functions as a substrate for a wheat kinase, the activity of which is modulated by low temperature (Lopez et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). It is possible that <italic>TaADF3</italic> contributes to cold tolerance by interacting with other proteins to modulate cell cytoskeleton dynamics.</p>
      <p>Plants perceive and respond adaptively to abiotic stress imposed by salt, cold, drought, and wounding, and the adaptive process is controlled mainly by the phytohormone ABA, which acts as an endogenous messenger in the regulation of plant water status (Swamy and Smith, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Tuteja, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The induction of <italic>TaADF3</italic> upon exogenous ABA application suggested that <italic>TaADF3</italic> may function as the downstream component in the ABA signaling pathway to elevate plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. ABA treatment is believed to result in stomatal closure through the disassembly of actin filaments (Eun and Lee, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Thus, it can be assumed that <italic>TaADF3</italic> may participate in the ABA signaling pathway under abiotic stresses through regulating the actin dynamics in wheat stomatal movement. The ABA-dependent stomatal closure is also likely to function as a pre-invasive defense barrier against pathogens. Despite of the positive role of ABA in pre-invasive defense, its role in post-invasive defense seems to be mostly negative (Ton et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Taking into account of the induced expression pattern of <italic>TaADF3</italic> under virulent <italic>Pst</italic>, it is reasonable that <italic>TaADF3</italic> is engaged in the negative regulation of post-invasive defense against <italic>Pst</italic> mediated by ABA, rather than contribute to the early pre-invasive defense.</p>
      <p>ADFs have been implicated to play an important role in determining plant resistance against pathogenic microbes (Hardham et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). <italic>HvADF3</italic> was demonstrated to mediate race-specific immune responses in barley to an appropriate powdery mildew pathogen (Miklis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In the wheat-<italic>Pst</italic> interaction pathosystem, <italic>TaADF7</italic> was demonstrated to positively contribute to wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> (Fu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In contrast to <italic>TaADF7, TaADF3</italic> function as a negative regulator in wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic>. Silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> enhanced race-specific immunity to <italic>Pst</italic> in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants. In response to the virulent <italic>Pst</italic> CYR31, <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants was less susceptible with increased HR cell death, ROS accumulation and less sporulation. Previous histological and cytological observations revealed the oxidative bursts in the early (12&#x2013;24 h) and late (96&#x2013;120 h) infection stages of <italic>Pst</italic> (Wang et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The induced <italic>TaADF3</italic> expression at 120 hpi in compatible interaction may be responsible for the suppression of ROS production. Thus, silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> led to increased ROS accumulation in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-kncokdown plants. It seemed that <italic>TaADF3</italic> negatively regulated wheat resistance in an ROS-dependent manner. Nevertheless, upon avirulent <italic>Pst</italic> infection, <italic>TaADF3</italic>-kncokdown plants retained complete resistance, but with less HR and ROS, which is closer to the immune response. The Arabidopsis <italic>AtADF1-4</italic> RNAi lines exhibited suppressed HR mediated by AvrPphB but retained the disease resistance phenotype (Tian et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It appeared that HR can be uncoupled from resistance and that HR is not always for gene-for gene resistance. However, it is still possible that <italic>TaADF3</italic> may function in a dose-dependent manner to amplify defense signals. According to the hypothesis described by Jones and Dangl (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), effective resistance or HR is achieved only when the amplitude of the defense signal reaches a certain threshold. We infer that the residual transcript of <italic>TaADF3</italic> was sufficient to sustain disease resistance but insufficient to attain the threshold for eliciting strong HR, as observed for <italic>AtADF4</italic> (Tian et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has been documented that the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in resistance during early stages of fungal penetration (Hardham et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Miklis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The ectopic expression of <italic>HvADF3</italic> in barley leaf epidermal cells confers enhanced fungal entry of the powdery mildew fungus by interfering with the integrity of the plant actin cytoskeleton (Miklis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In our study, silencing of <italic>TaADF3</italic> resulted in transformed array of the actin filaments, which presumably serve as tracks for deposition of callose, secretion of antimicrobial products and delivery of vectorial vesicle (Henty-Ridilla et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Based on the finding that <italic>Pst</italic> germinates on the leaf surface and penetrate through the stoma, it is tempting to speculate that the altered actin architecture partially attenuated <italic>Pst</italic> infection. The observed decreased haustoria number may be partially attributed to the impeded fungal entry. As the unique infection structure of biotrophic pathogens in host cells, the haustorium makes intimate contact with the host cell membrane and allows nutrient uptake and effector release into host cells (Voegele and Mendgen, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The resulting compromised haustoria formation of <italic>Pst</italic> in <italic>TaADF3</italic>-knockdown plants would lead to a repressed nutrient supply, further limiting the growth and expansion of <italic>Pst</italic>. Whether the hindered <italic>Pst</italic> entry was due to the role of <italic>TaADF3</italic> on actin architecture is still unclear, although it seems that no detectable change was observed in mesophyll cells actin filaments.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that <italic>TaADF3</italic> can positively modulate plant acclimation to abiotic stresses, possibly as a downstream component of ABA signaling pathway. Moreover, it suggested that <italic>TaADF3</italic> functions as a negative regulator in wheat resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> dependent on interfering the actin architecture, via limiting ROS release and hindering pathogen penetration. Nevertheless, the exact functional mechanism of <italic>TaADF3</italic> still needs further exploration.</p>
