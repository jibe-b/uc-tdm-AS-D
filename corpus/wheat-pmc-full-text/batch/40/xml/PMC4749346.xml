      <abstract>
        <p>Rust fungal pathogens of wheat (<italic>Triticum</italic> spp.) affect crop yields worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence of these pathogens remain elusive, due to the limited availability of suitable molecular genetic research tools. Notably, the inability to perform high-throughput analyses of candidate virulence proteins (also known as effectors) impairs progress. We previously established a pipeline for the fast-forward screens of rust fungal candidate effectors in the model plant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. This pipeline involves selecting candidate effectors <italic>in silico</italic> and performing cell biology and protein-protein interaction assays <italic>in planta</italic> to gain insight into the putative functions of candidate effectors. In this study, we used this pipeline to identify and characterize sixteen candidate effectors from the wheat yellow rust fungal pathogen <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic>. Nine candidate effectors targeted a specific plant subcellular compartment or protein complex, providing valuable information on their putative functions in plant cells. One candidate effector, PST02549, accumulated in processing bodies (P-bodies), protein complexes involved in mRNA decapping, degradation, and storage. PST02549 also associates with the P-body-resident ENHANCER OF mRNA DECAPPING PROTEIN 4 (EDC4) from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> and wheat. We propose that P-bodies are a novel plant cell compartment targeted by pathogen effectors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plant pathogens colonize hosts by deploying virulence proteins known as effectors that manipulate plant cell structures and functions [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Once delivered into host tissues, effectors reside in the extracellular space (apoplastic effectors) or translocate into the plant cells (cytoplasmic effectors). Unravelling how effectors function in the host is key to understanding parasitism and to developing resistant plants [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pathogen effectors are operationally plant proteins; they function in plant tissues, they associate with plant molecules, and their phenotypic expression in plants drives their evolution [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The field of effector biology has rapidly advanced in recent years due in large part to the availability of host plants that are amenable to molecular genetics and in which effectors can be heterologously expressed and studied [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, due to the limited availability of functional genetic resources for crop species, characterising the effectors of crop pathogens remains challenging [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To study crop pathogen effectors, an alternative approach is the use a surrogate experimental plant system, such as <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (Solanaceae) is a well-established experimental system to study proteins <italic>in planta</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The agroinfiltration method allows transient expression of proteins in leaf cells, and a wide range of assays is available for functional investigations. Thus, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> is extensively used in effector biology [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We recently used this plant to set up an effectoromics pipeline aimed at determining the plant cell compartments and protein complexes targeted by candidate effectors of rust fungi [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such pipeline is a valuable tool for the rapid screening of candidate effectors.</p>
      <p>Rust fungi (Pucciniales) are notorious for being destructive crop pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The species that infect wheat pose a constant threat to global food security [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These fungal pathogens include the yellow rust fungus <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To date, effectors have not been functionally characterized for this species. However, genome and transcriptome analyses have predicted hundreds of candidate effectors, most of which are secreted proteins of unknown function [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cantu and colleagues recently combined genome and <italic>in silico</italic> analyses to prioritize candidate effectors for further functional analyses [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Processing bodies (P-bodies) are protein/RNA complexes that reside in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. They control the decapping, degradation, and storage of mRNA molecules [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In plants, P-bodies and P-body-resident proteins have important roles in post-embryonic development [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], salt stress tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In animals and yeast, limited evidence suggests that pathogenic bacteria and viruses target P-bodies [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To date, no connection has been made between P-bodies and filamentous pathogens.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated sixteen candidate effectors of the wheat yellow rust fungus <italic>P</italic>. <italic>striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic> using the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> effectoromics pipeline we previously developed [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We discovered that nine candidate effectors accumulate in distinct plant cell compartments and associate with specific protein complexes. Notably, the candidate effector PST02549 accumulates in P-bodies and associates with the wheat enhancer of mRNA decapping protein 4. Our findings point to P-bodies as a novel plant compartment targeted by pathogen effectors. We also propose that <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> can be used as an experimental system to screen candidate effectors of pathogens of monocot plants.</p>

        <title>Selection of 16 candidate effectors from <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic></title>
        <p>The predicted effector complement of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic> consists of hundreds of secreted proteins [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To select candidate effectors for functional investigations, we leveraged our recently developed pipeline [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] to select eleven proteins, using transcript enrichment in purified haustoria as the principal criterion for selection. We also included five proteins previously flagged as promising candidates [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to obtain a final list of sixteen candidate effectors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0149035.t001">Table 1</xref>, Sheet A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149035.s005">S1 Table</xref>). These sixteen candidates are Pucciniales-specific, and only seven show some sequence similarity to proteins of the wheat stem rust fungus <italic>Puccinia graminis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0149035.t001">Table 1</xref>). This finding suggests that most of these candidate effectors recently emerged in the Pucciniaceae family.</p>

        <title>Seven candidate effectors accumulate in specific plant cell compartments</title>
        <p>To identify the plant cell compartments in which the candidate effectors accumulate, we performed live-cell imaging of cells expressing effector-GFP fusions. Seven out of the sixteen fusion proteins displayed an informative distribution in leaf cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149035.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The fluorescence signal from PST02549-GFP and PST03196-GFP accumulated in small cytosolic bodies and chloroplasts, respectively, as well as in the nucleus and the cytosol. The fluorescence signal from PST18220-GFP labelled both chloroplasts and nuclei, suggesting a dual targeting to the two organelles. The fluorescence signal from PST18447-GFP, PST11721-GFP, and PST15391-GFP specifically accumulated in nuclei, and PST11721-GFP also labelled nuclear foci in some rare cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149035.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Finally, the fluorescence signal from PST05023-GFP labelled endomembrane compartments. The fluorescence signal from the remaining nine fusion proteins had a non-informative distribution in the nucleus and the cytosol, similar to the distribution of a free GFP control [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
        <p>To explain the specific accumulation patterns observed, we examined the candidate effectors for subcellular targeting sequences. We focused on PST15391 and PST18447, because they showed specific, robust accumulation in nuclei (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149035.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149035.g002">2</xref>). Previous analysis failed to identify a nuclear-localisation signal (NLS) for PST15391 and PST18447 [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, we noted that both carry NLS-like stretches of amino acids enriched in positively charged residues at the C-terminus and N-terminus of their mature forms, respectively. Truncations lacking the NLS-like sequences were depleted from the nucleus and accumulated mainly in the cytosol, indicating that the NLS-like regions are necessary for specific nuclear accumulation. This set of experiments suggests that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic> effectors use targeting sequences to traffic within plant cells.</p>

NbEDC4, TaEDC4, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> EDC4 (AtEDC4, also known as VARICOSE or VCS) are of a similar length (1203 to 1349 amino acids) and exhibit a pairwise amino acid sequence identity of between 42 and 46% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149035.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

Images present a single optical section of 0.8 &#x3BC;m of a maximal projection of up to 6 optical sections (max. z-stack of 4.8 &#x3BC;m). Overlay images merge GFP, mCherry, chlorophyll, and bright field signals. Note that for the PST02549-GFP/TaEDC4, TaEDC4 was untagged and the mCherry fluorescence signal was not recorded. Proteins were transiently expressed in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaf cells by agroinfiltration. Live-cell imaging was performed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope with a sequential scanning mode two days after infiltration. GFP and the chlorophyll were excited at 488 nm; the mCherry was excited at 561 nm. GFP (green), mCherry (red), and chlorophyll (blue) fluorescence were collected at 505&#x2013;525 nm, 580&#x2013;620 nm and 680&#x2013;700 nm, respectively. Black arrowheads indicate P-bodies. White arrowheads: nuclei. Note that the large protein aggregates formed by MLP124111-GFP do not show any TaEDC4-mCherry signal.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we found that PST02549 accumulates in plant cell P-bodies and associates with a P-body-derived protein. This observation suggests that an effector that targets plant P-bodies has evolved in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic>. To our knowledge, a connection between filamentous plant pathogens and P-bodies has not previously been established.</p>
      <p>How would a pathogen benefit from manipulating host P-bodies? Some plant pathogen effectors target components of the host RNA silencing machinery [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, two recent reports have connected P-bodies, or P-body-resident proteins, with plant immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149035.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, pathogen effectors may target P-bodies to manipulate RNA metabolism and/or suppress immune responses. Interestingly, pathogenic bacteria and viruses that infect mammals are known to alter the structure and function of host P-bodies [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, diverse parasites of eukaryotes have evolved to target host P-bodies. Further mechanistic investigations of the pathogen effector/P-body interplay should reveal the biological significance of this phenomenon.</p>
      <p>We observed an increase in P-body size upon co-expression of PST02549 and TaEDC4. The depletion or overexpression of P-body components is known to modify P-body integrity, which can lead to an increase in size [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the increase in P-body size observed in our study is due to over-accumulation of P-body-resident proteins such as PST02549 or TaEDC4. However, we observed this phenomenon only when the two proteins co-accumulated, indicating that both are required to increase P-body size. The biological significance of the association between PST02549 and TaEDC4 as well as the increase in P-body size remain to be further investigated in wheat.</p>
      <p>The pipeline we used in this study allowed us to identify nine candidate effectors that target a given subcellular compartment and/or protein complex. We use this specific behaviour in leaf cells as a rationale to hypothesize that these proteins are <italic>bona fide</italic> cytoplasmic effectors. Thus, we flag them as high priority candidate effectors to further characterize in wheat. Noteworthy, we recently obtained similar informative data for 40% of a set of candidate effectors from another rust species, the poplar leaf rust fungus <italic>Melampsora larici-populina</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings establish the proof-of-concept that <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> is a valuable heterologous system for fast-forward effectoromic analysis of plant pathogens, regardless of their host plant.</p>
      <p>In this study and in [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we performed an <italic>in planta</italic> protein-protein interaction screen in the heterologous plant <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>. Such approach has advantages and disadvantages compared with traditional methods used to perform protein-protein interaction screens, the most common being yeast-two hybrid [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As a main advantage, our screen takes place in a leaf cell. Therefore, the prey proteins are in their natural context, i.e. in complex with their partners in the relevant cellular compartment. This argument holds true for the bait (i.e. the candidate effector), provided that it is indeed a <italic>bona fide</italic> cytoplasmic effector. The principal disadvantage of our approach is that it is prone to false negatives; we may miss interactors that are specific to the natural host species, or that are too divergent in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> to associate with the bait. Importantly, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>striiformis</italic> f sp <italic>tritici</italic> does not infect solanaceous plants, and therefore its effectors do not associate with Solanaceous proteins <italic>in natura</italic>. Thus, follow up experiments are need to further validate the lead candidate interactors. The associations obtained via the screen help to rapidly identify interactors in the original host species, which are more likely to be biologically relevant.</p>
      <p>The field of rust effector biology has progressed relatively slowly regarding the functional characterisation of effectors despite the availability of pathogen genome sequences [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to PST02549, our study identified candidate effectors that should be treated as high priority proteins for further investigations. Notably, PST08468 specifically associated with members of the sucrose non-fermenting related protein kinases. These are key proteins that control the interplay between stress response and growth [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Studying PST08468 may help better understand how rust fungi manipulate this balance in their hosts.</p>
      <p>We identified plant interactors of candidate effectors, some of which may represent <italic>bone fide</italic> effector targets. Growing evidence suggests that during evolution domains from effector targets have been incorporated into immune receptors such as nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR, also referred to as NLR) proteins to become &#x2018;sensor domains&#x2019; that mediate recognition of specific effectors [<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149035.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A recent genome-wide analysis predicted many NLR gene models in which protein domains that differ from typical NLR domains have been incorporated (Sarris <italic>et al</italic>., in review). Interestingly, six of the eighteen top scoring effector interactors identified in our study carry a protein domain that is predicted to be integrated into a plant NLR, including the WD40 protein domain of EDC4 (Sheet B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149035.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, our predicted host targets can be a valuable source of new &#x2018;baits&#x2019; for engineering NLR genes with sensor domains.</p>
