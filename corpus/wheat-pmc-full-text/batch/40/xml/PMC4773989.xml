      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is an important pathogen of wheat and barley. In addition to severe yield losses, infested grains are often contaminated with harmful mycotoxins. In this study, we characterized the functions of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> kinase gene in different developmental and infection processes and gene regulation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The <italic>FgSSN3</italic> deletion mutant had a nutrient-dependent growth defects and abnormal conidium morphology. It was significantly reduced in DON production, <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression, and virulence. Deletion of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> also resulted in up-regulation of <italic>HTF1</italic> and <italic>PCS1</italic> expression in juvenile cultures, and repression of <italic>TRI</italic> genes in DON-producing cultures. In addition, <italic>Fgssn3</italic> was female sterile and defective in hypopodium formation and infectious growth. RNA-seq analysis showed that FgSsn3 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a wide variety genes acting as either a repressor or activator. FgSsn3 physically interacted with C-type cyclin Cid1 and the <italic>cid1</italic> mutant had similar phenotypes with <italic>Fgssn3</italic>, indicating that FgSsn3 and Cid1 form the CDK-cyclin pair as a component of the mediator complex in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Taken together, our results indicate that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is important for secondary metabolism, sexual reproduction, and plant infection, as a subunit of mediator complex contributing to transcriptional regulation of diverse genes.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Wheat head blight (FHB) disease is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat. <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is a major causal agent of FHB in the world<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and it also infects other small grain crops, including barley and maize<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In addition to yield losses, this pathogen is a producer of deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, and other mycotoxins. DON is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis and zearalenone is an estrogenic mycotoxin. Both of them are harmful to human and animals.</p>
    <p><italic>F. graminearum</italic> initiates plant infection when ascospores land on flowering wheat heads. The fungus could form hyphopodia for direct penetration of plant tissues. DON is a phytotoxin and it is, in fact, the first virulence factor identified in <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The <italic>TRI5</italic> trichodiene synthase gene is expressed as early as in hyphopodia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Other important pathogenicity factors that have been characterized in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> include genes involved in various signal transduction pathways, metabolism, and developmental processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Interestingly, a number of them, such as the protein kinase genes related to cAMP signaling and three mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways also are involved in the regulation of DON biosynthesis and sexual reproduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Other protein kinase genes that are important for DON production, plant infection, and sexual reproduction include <italic>SNF1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><italic>, FGK3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and several genes characterized in the kinome study of <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. One of them is FGSG_04484 that encodes a protein orthologous to the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) Ssn3 (=Srb10 or Ume5) in yeast and CDK8 in human.</p>
    <p>Orthologs of Ssn3 are conserved from yeast to humans and involved in regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent gene transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Ssn3 is the only protein kinase in the yeast mediator complex, which functions as a bridge between gene-specific transcription regulators and Pol II machinery at the promoter region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Like Cdk8 in humans, kinase activity of Ssn3 is related to binding with C-type cyclin Ssn8 (=Srb11). In yeast, Ssn3 is a regulator of global transcription and affects many important cellular processes, such as filamentous growth and cell cycle progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In humans, Cdk8 has been shown to repress the transcription of immune response genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and activate genes within the serum response network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
    <p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>SSN3</italic> was originally identified as a suppressor of the C-terminal domain (CTD) truncation of Pol II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Together with its cyclin Ssn8, yeast Ssn3 forms a stable complex with Srb8 and Srb9, which is one sub-module of the mediator complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. As a nonessential subunit of the mediator complex, Ssn3 regulates gene transcription probably by phosphorylation of the CTD of Pol II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Deletion of <italic>SSN3</italic> decreases the stability of meiotic mRNAs and induces the expression of genes repressed by glucose and mating type-specific genes. <italic>SSN3</italic> also is involved in the regulation of genes related to stress responses and nutrient utilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>
    <p>Although <italic>SSN3</italic> orthologs are well conserved in plant pathogenic ascomycetes, none of them has been functional characterized. This study aims to determine the function of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> in plant infection and other developmental processes in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Deletion of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> resulted in medium-dependent growth defects, loss of female fertility, reduced hyphopodium formation, and defects in infectious growth. In DON-producing cultures, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was repressed in <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression but increased in the transcription of genes related to aurofusarin biosynthesis. RNA-seq analysis also showed that FgSsn3 negatively or positively regulated the transcription of different subsets of genes. FgSsn3 physically interacted with C-type cyclin Cid1 and likely functions as the CDK-cyclin pair in the mediator complex to regulate the expression of various genes important for growth, differentiation, and pathogenesis in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

        <title>The <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant has nutrient-dependent growth defects</title>
        <p>The <italic>SSN3</italic> ortholog in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> FGSG_04484.3 named as <italic>FgSSN3</italic> in this study encodes a 453 amino acid protein. Sequence alignment revealed that <italic>SSN3</italic> orthologs are well conserved in filamentous fungi. The <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was generated with the split-marker approach in a previous study of the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> kinome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In this study, three putative <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutants, M5, M7, and M9 were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). All the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutants had the same phenotype although only data for M9 were described below. Compared with the wild type, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was reduced in growth rate and produced fewer and shorter aerial hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the growth defect of the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutants was nutrient-dependent. In comparison with the growth rate of PH-1, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutants had the most significant reduction (56%) on 5&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;YEG and less reduction (13%) on oatmeal agar (OTA) and PDA (27%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Whereas 5&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;YEG is a synthetic medium, OTA and PDA are medium with natural substrates.</p>

        <title><italic>FgSSN3</italic> is essential for female fertility</title>
        <p>When assayed for sexual reproduction on carrot agar medium, the wild type formed small black perithecia 7 days post-perithecial induction, and produced cirrhi after 10 days. However, no perithecia were observed in <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), indicating the importance of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> during sexual reproduction. To determine whether its mating defects were related to male or female fertility, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was out-crossed with the <italic>mat1-1-1</italic> deletion mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. When <italic>Fgssn3</italic> was used as the male, fertile perithecia with normal ascospores were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, no perithecia were formed when <italic>Fgssn3</italic> was used as the female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is essential for female fertility but dispensable for male fertility.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>The <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant is de-repressed in conidiophore development</title>
        <p>Although the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was reduced in growth rate, it produced the same amount of conidia as the wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Microscopic examination revealed that the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant tended to produce phialides and conidia earlier than the wild type. After 12&#x2009;h incubation in CMC medium, clusters of phialides were observed in <italic>Fgssn3</italic> but not in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, mutant conidia were shorter and had fewer septa than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Approximately one-third of the mutant conidia also lacked typical tip or foot cells. Nevertheless, <italic>Fgssn3</italic> conidia could germinate normally although germ tube growth was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>), which is consistent with its reduced growth rate.</p>
        <p>We transformed the full-length <italic>FgSSN3</italic> allele into the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant. The resulting <italic>Fgssn3</italic>/<italic>FgSSN3</italic> transformant had the wild-type growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and normal conidium morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The defects of the mutant in sexual reproduction and plant infection also were complemented by the ectopic integration of <italic>FgSSN3</italic>, indicating that deletion of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> was directly responsible for defects of <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutants.</p>

        <title><italic>HTF1</italic> and <italic>PCS1</italic> are up-regulated in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant</title>
        <p>In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, a number of genes, including <italic>FgMCM1</italic>, <italic>FgSTUA, PCS1, HTF1, COM1, FgCOS1, RAC1</italic>, and <italic>CON2</italic> are known to be important for conidiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To assay their expression in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant, RNA samples were isolated from 12&#x2009;h CMC cultures. Compared with PH-1, transcript abundance of other genes was not affected, but the expression levels of <italic>HTF1</italic> and <italic>PCS1</italic> were up-regulated over 3- and 5-fold, respectively, in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The <italic>PCS1</italic> transcription factor gene plays a role in regulating proper production of conidia. Overexpression of <italic>PCS1</italic> increased the formation of intercalary phialides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. <italic>HTF1</italic> encodes a conserved homeobox transcription factor important for conidiogenesis and phialide formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The up-regulation of these two genes in <italic>Fgssn3</italic> may be responsible for the de-repression of phialide formation and conidiation in 12&#x2009;h CMC cultures.</p>

        <title><italic>FgSSN3</italic> is important for plant colonization and infectious growth</title>
        <p>In infection assays with flowering wheat heads, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant developed typical disease symptoms only on the inoculated kernels but never spread to neighboring spikelets at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The average disease index of the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant M9 and PH-1 was 0.7 and 11.3, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), which was approximately a 90% reduction in virulence. Therefore, <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is essential for disease spreading and colonization of wheat head tissues. Similar results were obtained in infection assays with corn stalks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and silks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Stalk rot and discoloration were restricted to the inoculated sites. These results suggest that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> may play an important role in infectious growth in plant tissues.</p>
        <p>To further determine the function of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> in plant infection, we examined the infection processes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy. At 24&#x2009;hours post infection (hpi), the wild-type strain formed penetration structures on wheat glumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Under the same conditions, <italic>Fgssn3</italic> was significantly reduced in hyphopodium formation. In fact, hyphopodia were rarely observed in samples inoculated with the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Nevertheless, infectious hyphae were observed in lemma tissues inoculated with both the wild type and <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant at 48&#x2009;hpi although the extent of invasive growth was significantly reduced in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). By 5&#x2009;dpi, fungal growth was not observed in the rachis below or above the spikelets inoculated with the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Under the same conditions, abundant intracellular hyphae were observed in the vascular and other tissues of the rachis in samples inoculated with PH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>). These results further indicate that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is important for infectious growth and spreading from the inoculated spikelet to the rachis and nearby spikelets, which is consistent with its disease index being less than 1.</p>

        <title><italic>FgSSN3</italic> positively regulates DON biosynthesis during plant infection and in DON-inducing culture conditions</title>
        <p>Because of its importance as a virulence factor, we assayed DON production in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant. In wheat kernels with scab symptoms collected 14&#x2009;dpi, over 1000&#x2009;ppm DON was detected in samples inoculated with PH-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, DON concentration was less than 50&#x2009;ppm in samples inoculated with the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). To confirm this observation, we assayed DON production in rice grain cultures as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. DON production was barely detectable in rice grains inoculated with <italic>Fgssn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also assayed the expression levels of the <italic>TRI4</italic>, <italic>TRI5</italic>, <italic>TRI6</italic>, <italic>TRI10</italic>, and <italic>TRI11</italic> genes in DON-inducing cultures containing 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;M arginine by qRT-PCR assay. In comparison with that of the wild type, the expression level of <italic>TRI4</italic>, <italic>TRI5</italic>, <italic>TRI6</italic>, <italic>TRI10</italic>, and <italic>TRI11</italic> was reduced in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant for approximately 20, 2.5, 2, 3, and 30 folds, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

        <p>To identify genes regulated by FgSsn3 in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, we conducted RNA-seq analysis with RNA samples isolated from 36&#x2009;h CM cultures of the wild-type strain PH-1 and the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant M9. In total, 2839 genes had over two-fold differences in expression levels between PH-1 and M9, including 1348 and 1491 genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant. Among them, 259 were specifically expressed in <italic>Fgssn3</italic> and 196 were only expressed in PH-1.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In eukaryotic organisms, the mediator complex directly bind to RNA polymerase II to regulate the transcription of various genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Ssn3 is a nonessential subunit of the mediator complex that is conserved between yeast and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Like <italic>SSN3</italic> in yeast, deletion of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is not lethal but important for hyphal growth and germ tube elongation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In the fission yeast, the generation time of the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant was longer than that of the wild-type strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. It is possible that the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant also had a longer generation time, which may be related to reduction in growth rate. Interestingly, the growth rate reduction of the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was nutrient dependent. The reduction in growth was more significant on synthetic media than on media with natural substrates. In yeast, Ssn3 also inhibits yeast filamentous growth in rich medium by phosphorylation of Ste12 and decreasing its stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although it was reduced in growth, the number of conidia produced by the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was not reduced. In fact, conidiophore development was de-repressed in juvenile CMC cultures. As early as 12&#x2009;h after inoculation, clusters of conidiophores were observed in the mutant CMC cultures. The up-regulation of <italic>PCS1</italic> and <italic>HIF1</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> may be related to conidiophore formation in juvenile cultures. Nevertheless, we noticed that conidia produced by the mutant had abnormal morphology. Unlike normal 5&#x2013;7 celled conidia produced by the wild type, <italic>Fgssn3</italic> conidia vary from 1 to 4 compartments. We also noticed that many of the conidium compartments contained more than one nucleus. Therefore, <italic>FgSSN3</italic> must also play a role in mitosis and cytokinesis during conidium development.</p>
      <p>Although <italic>SSN3</italic> orthologs are well conserved in plant pathogenic fungi, none of them have been shown to be related to pathogenesis. Our data showed that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is critical for plant infection. The disease index of the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was less than 1, showing that it was defective in both causing symptoms in the inoculated kernels and spreading via the rachis in infected wheat heads. One contributing factor to its defects in plant infection could be related to the reduction in growth rate. However, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant also was reduced in hyphopodium formation and penetration of lemma epidermal cells. In addition, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was significantly reduced in DON production in diseased wheat kernels and DON is an important virulence factor in <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is dispensable for male fertility, it is essential for female fertility, indicating that it may regulate the expression of sub-sets of genes important for the formation of protoperithecia and other developmental processes related to female fertility. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, a number of genes have been reported to be essential for female fertility but dispensable for male fertility, including the <italic>MGV1</italic> and <italic>FgHOG1</italic> MAP kinase and <italic>ZIF1</italic> and <italic>MYT1</italic> transcription factor genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. However, to our knowledge, no mutants are known to be normal in female fertility but defective in male fertility in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. It is likely that female fertility involving the formation of protoperithecia requires many more genes than male fertility in this homothallic fungus. In the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, a heterothallic fungus, the <italic>MCM1</italic> transcription factor is essential for male fertility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p>
      <p>No perithecium formation was observed in self-crosses in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>SSN3</italic>, also known as <italic>UME5</italic>, is important for meiosis and sporulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. However, because deletion of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> blocked perithecium formation on mating plates, it is impossible to conclude that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is important for meiosis and ascospore formation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. As an important transcriptional regulator, <italic>FgSSN3</italic> may be involved in the regulation of hyphal fusion and other processes necessary for proto-perithecium development. Because <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is a homothallic fungus, it is also possible that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is important for switching from vegetative growth to sexual reproduction.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, two transcripts of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> were observed in this study with transcript A encoding a 13-aa shorter protein than transcript B due to the retention of an intron in its 5&#x2032;-UTR. Although the 13 extra amino acid residues at the N-terminal region of FgSsn3B is 39-aa upstream from its kinase domains and unlikely to affect its kinase function, we noticed that transcript A was the predominant transcript of FgSSN3 in conidia, and hyphae but transcript B had a twice more abundant than transcript A in perithecia. Therefore, it remains possible that transcript B plays a stage-specific role in gene expression regulation during sexual reproduction.</p>
      <p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the highly conserved aspartic acid residue at position 290 and lysine residue at position 183, are essential for the kinase activity and function of the Srb10 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the D191A or K71R mutations at the equivalent sites of FgSsn3 produced similar phenotypes as the <italic>FgSSN3</italic> deletion mutant, indicating the importance of kinase activity of FgSsn3 in the function of the protein.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant was reduced in DON production but increased in aurofusarin biosynthesis under DON-inducing conditions. Therefore, deletion of <italic>FgSSN3</italic> does not generally blocking secondary metabolism, which is consistent with the fact that <italic>SSN3</italic> has both negative and positive regulatory roles in gene regulation in the budding yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. <italic>FgSSN3</italic> likely has similar regulatory functions in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Our RNA-seq analysis results showed that the transcription of 1348 and 1491 genes was up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant. Some genes important for secondary metabolism appeared to be de-repressed in the CM cultures of the mutant, suggesting that <italic>FgSSN3</italic> is involved in the repression of these genes during vegetative growth. To our surprise, two <italic>TRI</italic> genes had increased expression levels in CM cultures, although DON production and <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression were reduced in DON inducing cultures and infected wheat kernels in the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant. These results indicate that regulation of specific subsets of genes by <italic>FgSSN3</italic> may depend on culture conditions, which is consistent with medium-dependent growth defects of <italic>Fgssn3</italic> on different media.</p>
      <p>In yeast, Ssn3 interacts with Ssn8 to form a kinase-cyclin pair that functions together with Srb8 and Srb9 as part of the kinase module of the mediator complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. <italic>SSN8</italic> is orthologous to the <italic>CID</italic> gene in <italic>F. graminearum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Like the <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant, the <italic>cid1</italic> mutant was defective in conidium morphology and reduced in growth rate, DON production, and virulence. We further showed that FgSsn3 physically interacted with Cid1. Therefore, FgSsn3 and Cid1 form a similar CDK-cyclin pair that is functionally related to the mediator to affect the transcription by the Pol II holoenzyme in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>For transcriptional regulation, Ssn3 can directly phosphorylate the Ser5 of the triple heptapeptide repeats in the CTD of the largest subunit of Pol II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Sequence alignment analysis showed that these phosphorylation sites are conserved in the large subunit of Pol II in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Orthologs of many components of the yeast mediator complex also are conserved in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and other filamentous ascomycetes. Our studies implicate the role of the mediator complex in plant infection, secondary metabolism, and development in a fungal pathogen. In plants, the mediator complex has been shown to be involved in a variety of processes, including defense responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Considering the importance of the mediator complex in fungal-plant interactions, it will be important to identify and characterize different subsets of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the FgSsn3-Cid1 CDK-cyclin pair during pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms related to the mediator complex Pol II activity.</p>

For each sample, at least 18&#x2009;Mb paired-end reads were obtained. The resulting RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the reference genome of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strain PH-1 with Tophat 2.0.12<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. The number of reads (counts) aligned to each predicted transcript was calculated by FeatureCounts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Differential expression analysis of genes was performed with the edgeRun package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref> using the UCexactTest function with the Benjamini and Hochberg&#x2019;s algorithm to control the false discovery rate (FDR). To filter out weakly expressed genes, only genes with a minimum expression level of 1 count per million in at least two samples were included in the analysis. Genes with a FDR of below 0.05 were considered differentially expressed between <italic>Fgssn3</italic> mutant and PH-1. The RNA-Seq data have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database with accession code PRJNA289285.</p>
