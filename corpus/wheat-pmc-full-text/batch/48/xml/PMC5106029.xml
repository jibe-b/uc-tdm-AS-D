      <abstract>
        <p>3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMD) encoded by <italic>LEU2</italic> is a key enzyme in leucine (Leu) biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of the genome sequence of <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> revealed two paralogous <italic>LEU2</italic> genes (designated as <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic>) in this fungus and the deduced amino acid sequences of FgLeu2A and FgLeu2B share 45% identity. Targeted disruption of individual <italic>FgLEU2A/B</italic> gene in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> assigned a more crucial role of FgLeu2A in Leu biosynthesis as disruption of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> resulted in mutant (&#x394;FgLeu2A-10) that was Leu-auxotrophic and could not grow in minimal medium limited for amino acids, whereas <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> deletion mutant &#x394;FgLeu2B-2 was morphologically indistinguishable from the wild type strain PH-1. The growth defects of &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 could be overcome by exogenous addition of Leu at 0.25 mM. Double deletion of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> (&#x394;FgLeu2AB-8) caused a more severe Leu-auxotrophic phenotype as the concentration of Leu exogenously added to medium to rescue the growth defect of &#x394;FgLeu2AB-8 should be raised to 1.25 mM, indicating a less important but nonnegligible role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis. Disturb of Leu biosynthesis caused by <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deletion leads to slower growth rate, reduced aerial hyphal formation and red pigmentation on PDA plates and completely blocked conidial production and germination. All of the defects above could be overcome by Leu addition or complementation of the full-length <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> gene. &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 also showed significantly increased sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses. Pathogenicity assay results showed that virulence of mutants lacking <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> were dramatically impaired on wheat heads and non-host cherry tomatoes. Additionally, a low level of deoxynivalenol (DON) production of &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 and &#x394;FgLeu2AB-8 in wheat kernels was also detected. Taken together, results of this study indicated a crucial role of FgLeu2A and a less important role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis and fungal infection-related morphogenesis in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> and FgLeu2A may serve as a potential target for novel antifungal development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including leucine (Leu), valine (Val) and isoleucine (Ile) can be synthesized in bacteria, fungi and high plants, but not mammals. Mammals must acquire BCAAs from their diet and the absence of BCAAs biosynthetic pathway in mammals make the enzymes involved attractive targets for the development of herbicides and anti-microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that BCAAs, especially Leu, not only serve as fundamental substrates for protein synthesis but also have unique ability to initiate signal transduction pathways that modulate translation initiation [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Leu is synthesized as a branch that leads from 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV), the intermediate precursor of Val, to Leu and its biosynthesis contains four enzymatic reactions catalyzed by isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS, encoded by <italic>LEU4</italic>), isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI, encoded by <italic>LEU1</italic>), isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMD, encoded by <italic>LEU2</italic>) and branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT, encoded by <italic>BCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The third Leu biosynthetic specific enzyme IPMD catalyzes the conversion of 3-isopropylmalate (3-IPPM) to 2-ketoisocaproate (2-KIC) and its encoding gene <italic>LEU2</italic> is one of the best-studied BCAA biosynthetic genes because of its wide use as selected marker for gene-transformation experiments in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and several other yeast species [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>In <italic>S</italic>.<italic>cerevisiae</italic>, functional analysis showed that disruption of <italic>LEU2</italic> resulted in Leu-auxotroph and decreased resistance to acetic acid and to very high levels of ethanol stress of the mutants [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Very few documents characterized functions of <italic>LEU2</italic> in filamentous fungi except for a relatively ancient and primary research in <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> showed that this fungus elaborates two isoenzymes of IPMD and these two encoding genes were differentially expressed [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the detailed function of these two paralogous <italic>LEU2</italic> genes in Leu biosynthesis or other cellular processes was not investigated in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>niger</italic> or other filamentous fungi.</p>
      <p>Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by the pathogenic ascomycete fungus <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (teleomorph <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic>) is one of the most important diseases in cereal crops including wheat and barley worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. FHB epidemics would not only cause huge yield losses but also bring health threaten and food safety concern to humans and animals as the fungus produces mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) during infection [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Disease control of FHB and mycotoxin contaminations remains challenging due to the lack of resistant wheat cultivars to FHB and limited effective fungicides against <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminaerum</italic>. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to develop novel, less-toxic and effective fungicides for the management of FHB. Enzymes involved in certain amino acids biosynthesis (e.g., BCAAs) have been regarded as attractive fungicide targets due to their absence in mammals and the important biological functions of the genes encoding for these enzymes in yeasts and filamentous fungi [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we found two paralogous <italic>LEU2</italic> genes in the genome of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, using targeted-gene disruption strategy we have constructed single and double deletion mutants of <italic>FgLEU2A/B</italic> gene in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> and investigated the different roles of each gene in Leu biosynthesis and in other important cellular processes. Our results are in consistence with previous findings that BCAAs biosynthesis is important event and FgLeu2A plays more important roles in Leu biosynthesis and infection-related morphogenesis and can be regarded as potential target for novel fungicide development.</p>

        <p>The <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> strain PH-1 (a Michigan field isolate, USA origin, FGSC 9075, NRRL31084 [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) was used as the parental wild-type. To assess the mycelial growth and colony characteristics, the wild-type strain PH-1 and mutants were cultured on different medium including potato dextrose agar (PDA), yeast extract peptone glucose agar (YEPD), fructose gelatin agar (FGA) or minimal medium (MM) plates supplemented with or without different amino acids and incubated at 25&#xB0;C. Colony diameter was measured every 12 h. Fungal biomass analysis was conducted by collecting mycelia from 2-days-old liquid culture, and then washed with sterilized water, dried in 65&#xB0;C bake oven and determined by mycelial dry weight. Experiments were performed triplicate. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x3B1; was cultured at 37&#xB0;C and used for bacterial transformations. For conidiation assay, five 5-mm mycelial plugs of the wild-type strain and mutants taken from the edge of a 3-day-old colony were inoculated in a 50-ml triangular flask containing 20 ml of MBL (40 g mung beans boiled in 1 L water for 20 min, and then filtered through cheesecloth) for conidiation. The flasks were incubated at 25&#xB0;C for 4 days in a shaker (180 rpm). The amount of conidia produced by the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> strains in MBL was counted using a hemacytometer. Additionally, conidial germination was carried out by re-suspending the conidia of the wild-type strain and mutants in 2% sterilized sucrose solutions supplemented with or without different amino acids at 25&#xB0;C for 4 h and 6 h, conidial germination was examined under a Nikon ECLIPSE E100 microscope (Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan). Each experiment was carried out with three replicates.</p>

RNA was extracted from mycelia of the wild-type PH-1 using a TaKaRa RNAiso Reagent (TaKaRa Biotech. Co., Dalian, China), and used for reverse transcription with the primer oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> using a PrimeScript<sup>&#x2122;</sup> RT reagent kit (TaKaRa Biotech. Co.,Dalian, China). PCR amplifications were conducted using the following parameters: initial denaturation at 95&#xB0;C for 3min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94&#xB0;C for 45 s, annealing at 53&#xB0;C for 45s, extension at 72&#xB0;C for 1.5 min, and final extension at 72&#xB0;C for 10 min. PCR products were detected on 1% agarose gels in Tris-acetate (TAE) buffer and photographed after staining with ethidium bromide. The resultant PCR product was purified, cloned and sequenced.</p>

        <title>Construction of <italic>FgLEU2A/B</italic> deletion mutants</title>
        <p><italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deletion vector pBS-leu2A-Del was constructed by inserting two flanking sequences of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> gene into the left and right sides of the hygromycin resistance gene <italic>HPH</italic> in the pBS-HPH1 vector [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. First, a 651-bp upstream flanking sequence fragment of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> was amplified by using primer pair A1 + A2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s004">S1 Table</xref>) from the genomic DNA of PH-1, and was inserted into <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Xho</italic>I sites of the pBS-HPH1 vector to generate pBS-leu2A-up. Subsequently, a 941-bp downstream flanking sequence fragment of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> amplified from PH-1 genomic DNA using the primers A3 + A4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s004">S1 Table</xref>) was inserted into <italic>Bam</italic>HI-<italic>Sac</italic>I sites of the pBS-leu2A-up vector to generate pBS-leu2A-Del. Similar to pBS-leu2A-Del, we constructed <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> deletion vector pBS-leu2B-Del (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s002">S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s003">S3A</xref> Figs). <italic>FgLEU2A/B</italic> double deletion vector pBS-leu2AB-Del was constructed by modifying pBS-leu2A-Del. The G418 sulfate resistance gene <italic>NEO</italic> amplified by using primer pair Neo-F + Neo-R from plasmid pBS-RP-Red-A8-NEO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s004">S1 Table</xref>) was introduced to the <italic>Xho</italic>I-<italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pBS-leu2A-Del. Finally, the 3095-, 2708- or 3455-bp fragments containing leu2A/B-upstream-HPH(NEO)-leu2A/B-downstream cassette was obtained by PCR amplification with primer pair A1 + A4 or B1+ B4 using diluted plasmid pBS-leu2A/leu2B/leu2AB-Del as templates. The resultant PCR product was purified and stored at -20&#xB0;C for protoplast transformation.</p>
        <p>The PEG-mediated protoplast fungal transformation was performed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PDA medium supplemented with hygromycin (100 mg/L) was used to select the resistant transformants.

        <title>Complementation of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deletion mutant</title>
        <p>To confirm that the phenotype of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deletion mutant is caused by disruption of the gene, the <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deletion mutant &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 (hereafter named &#x394;FgLeu2A-10) was complemented with the full-length <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> containing its promoter and terminator regions. The complemented plasmid pCA-leu2A-C was constructed using the backbone of pCAMBIA1300.

Then, a 3437-bp of full-length <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> gene including 997-bp upstream and 1313-bp terminator region was amplified using primers leu2A-com-F + leu2A-com-R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s004">S1 Table</xref>) from the genomic DNA of wild-type. This fragment was cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI-<italic>Xba</italic>I sites of pCA-NEO to generate the complement plasmid pCA-leu2A-C. Finally, the 4440-bp fragment containing neo- full-length leu2A cassette was obtained by PCR amplification with primer pair Neo-F + leu2A-com-R using diluted plasmid of pCA-leu2A-C as templates (see s <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer and photographed after staining with ethidium bromide.

        <p>Diseased wheat kernels were harvested from inoculated spikelets 20 days after inoculation and used for DON production analysis using a previously described protocol [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165927.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].The amount of DON in each sample was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS) system (Agilent1100-6410, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). Mass spectrometric parameters were performed using a previously described detection method [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>Additionally, the amount of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> ergosterol in each sample was also determined. Total ergosterol was extracted from infected wheat powder by using a previously published protocol [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Ergosterol concentrations were quantified with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system, Waters 1525&#x2013;2489. Ergosterol was separated at room temperature on a hypersil BDSC18 250 nm&#xD7;4.6 nm, 5&#x3BC;m analytical column using 100% methanol (chromatography pure) as mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 282 nm. The identification of ergosterol was based on retention time and co-chromatography of commercial standard of ergosterol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).</p>

FgLeu2A and FgLeu2B share 45% identity in amino acid level.</p>
        <p><italic>FgLEU2A</italic> is 1313-bp in length and encodes 367 amino acids. <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> has four predicted introns and are 53-bp in length located between the 52<sup>th</sup> and 104<sup>th</sup> nucleotide, 55-bp in length located between the 126<sup>th</sup> and 180<sup>th</sup> nucleotide, 50-bp in length located between the 253<sup>h</sup> and 302<sup>th</sup> nucleotide, and 54-bp in length located between the 1024<sup>th</sup> and 1077<sup>th</sup> nucleotide, respectively. <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> is 1086-bp in length and encodes 362 amino acids. <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> has no predicted intron. Sequencing of the 1101-bp and 1086-bp cDNA of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic>, respectively, verified the existence of the predicted introns.</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 4.1 software [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and revealed two separated branches of Leu2 (Group1 and Group 2) in fungi.

The deletion mutant &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 and the complementation mutant &#x394;FgLeu2A-8C were chosen for further analysis. Subsequently, reverse transcription PCR with the primer pair leu2A-RT-F + leu2A-RT-R amplified an expected 246-bp fragment from the wild-type progenitor PH-1 and &#x394;FgLeu2A-8C, but not from the <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deletion mutant &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s002">S2B Fig</xref>).

      <p>Yeast species including <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Candia albicans</italic> possess single <italic>LEU2</italic> gene encoding IPMD, the penultimate enzyme in the Leu biosynthesis. In this study, however, <italic>LEU2</italic> gene duplication was found in the genome of several filamentous fungi including <italic>Aspergillus spp</italic>., <italic>Fusarium spp</italic>., <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> and <italic>Sporisorium reilianum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165927.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminaerum</italic>, paralogous genes encoding one enzyme have been previously reported. We have characterized functions of three <italic>cyp51</italic> genes encoding 14-&#x3B1;demethylases and two <italic>ERG24</italic> genes encoding sterol C-14 reductase of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, both enzymes are the targets of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBIs). Targeted disruption of individual gene revealed different roles of these genes in mediating sensitivity to SBIs, however, deletion of single gene showed no effects on vegetative development or virulence [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigates</italic>, Oliver <italic>et al</italic>., reported four putative <italic>ILV3</italic> (<italic>ILV3A</italic>-<italic>D</italic>) genes encoding DHAD with only Ilv3A required in BCAAs biosynthesis and full virulence [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recently, Liu <italic>et al</italic>. characterized two Cdc2 kinases orthologs with distinct functions in vegetative and infectious hyphae in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminaerum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. When comparing the genome sequences of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminaerum</italic>, we found 154 <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> multiple genes (gene duplication numbers from 2 to 6) corresponding 63 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> single genes. Further investigation into the functions of these duplicated genes would underlie the evolutionary mechanism of the fungus.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that <italic>A</italic>.<italic>niger</italic> elaborates two differentially expressed <italic>LEU2</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> were also differentially expressed in different cultures but the expression pattern of these two genes shares variations with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>niger LEU2</italic> genes. Expression of both <italic>FgLEU2</italic> genes could be detected during germination and hyphal formation phases and was greatly stimulated when cultured in low nutrition medium with <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> up-regulated in higher levels comparing with <italic>FgLEU2B</italic>. Different reactions of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> to nutrition starvation at transcriptional level indicated a more crucial role of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> in Leu biosynthesis in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>Functions of two <italic>LEU2</italic>orthologs have not been investigated in filamentous fungi. In this study, targeted disruption of individual <italic>FgLEU2</italic> gene in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> assigned different roles of FgLeu2A and FgLeu2B for Leu biosynthesis. The <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deleted mutants, but not the <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> deletion mutant displayed Leu auxotroph. Exogenous supplementation of Leu or 2-KIC rescued the auxotroph of both &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 and &#x394;FgLeu2AB-8, indicating FgLeu2A, but not FgLeu2B, is dependent for Leu biosynthesis. Additionally, judged from the minimal concentration of exogenously-added Leu for satisfaction of different mutants, deletion mutants of <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> lacking Leu auxotroph does not make FgLeu2B absolutely useless in Leu biosynthesis. &#x394;FgLeu2AB-8 required a higher concentration Leu or 2-KIC from culture medium to overcome its auxotroph than &#x394;FgLeu2A-10, indicating a minor role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>Apart from Leu biosynthesis, <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> also showed distinct roles in other cellular processes. Deletion mutants of <italic>FgLEU2</italic> showed different growth rates and aerial hyphal formation on different medium, indicating diverse roles of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> in the utilizations of different nutrients. Significant down-regulation of red pigmentation genes in the <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deleted mutants provided the molecular explanations for the reduced red pigment accumulation in these deletion mutants and assigned a more important role for <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> than <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> in secondary metabolism. <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> disruption mutants showed increased sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses comparing with the wild type strain PH-1. The increased sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses have also been observed in our previously characterized <italic>ILV</italic> mutants including <italic>FgILV5</italic>, <italic>FgILV1</italic>, <italic>FgILV2</italic> and <italic>FgILV6</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and as the cellular stresses assay were conducted using YEPD medium in which all the mutants could acquire enough Leu from culture medium and show no obvious grown defects, which indicating the involvement of <italic>FgLEU2</italic> genes in the adaption to osmotic and oxidative stresses and this involvement is Leu-independent. Additionally, the inhibitory rate of &#x394;FgLeu2AB-8 was higher than that of &#x394;FgLeu2A-10, which is also in agreement with the different role weight of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> and <italic>FgLEU2B</italic> in other cellular processes in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>.</p>
      <p>Plant infection assays revealed reduced aggressiveness of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> deleted mutants, which cannot be separated from the severe phenotypic defects exhibited by these mutants <italic>in vitro</italic>. The limited acquisition of Leu or 2-KIC from plant tissues the mutants encountered during colonization and mycelial spread within spikelets resulted in a series of infection-related defects including lower percentages of conidial germination, slower mycelial growth rate, reduced aerial hyphal formation, which may synthetically prevent the aggressiveness of the mutants within wheat heads. Second, it is well recognized that reactive oxygen species play crucial roles in host-pathogen interaction. When encountering pathogen attack, plants use the oxidative burst as an early defense reaction. <italic>FgLEU2A</italic>deficient mutants showed reduced tolerance to the oxidative stress mediated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which may be related to the failed colonization or reduced aggressiveness in plant tissues. Additionally, DON, the end product of the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway, has been identified as an important virulence factor and plays a crucial role in the spread of the fungus through the infected wheat head, the decreased DON production caused by the disruption of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> may also account for the reduced aggressiveness in &#x394;FgLeu2A-10 and &#x394;FgLeu2AB-8 [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previous studies in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> indicated that certain genes encoding BCAA biosynthetic enzymes(e.g., <italic>ILV2</italic>) were important for fungal survive and/or virulence [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent reports in the rice blast fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> have revealed crucial roles of several BCAA biosynthetic genes in fungal development and full virulence in filamentous fungi [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].We recently identified several Val and Ile biosynthetic genes with distinct but crucial roles in mycelial and conidial morphogenesis, plant infection, and DON biosynthesis in the important wheat head scab fungus <italic>F</italic>.<italic>graminearum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0165927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this present study, a series of phenotypic defects displayed by the deletion mutants of <italic>FgLEU2A</italic> indicated the involvement of this Leu biosynthetic enzyme encoding gene in fungal development and infection in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>. The important functional roles of these BCAA biosynthetic genes, together with the fact that BCAA biosynthesis only exist in high plants, fungi and bacteria but not mammals, are making enzymes involved in BCAAs biosynthesis attractive and potential targets for the development of herbicides, fungicides and other antimicrobial compounds.</p>
