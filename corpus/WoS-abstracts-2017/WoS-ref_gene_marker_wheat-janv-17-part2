AB A set of 2486 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compiled in chickpea using four approaches, namely (i) Solexa/Illumina sequencing (1409), (ii) amplicon sequencing of tentative orthologous genes (TOGs) (604), (iii) mining of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (286) and (iv) sequencing of candidate genes (187). Conversion of these SNPs to the cost-effective and flexible throughput Competitive Allele Specific PCR (KASPar) assays generated successful assays for 2005 SNPs. These marker assays have been designated as Chickpea KASPar Assay Markers (CKAMs). Screening of 70 genotypes including 58 diverse chickpea accessions and 12 BC3F2 lines showed 1341 CKAMs as being polymorphic. Genetic analysis of these data clustered chickpea accessions based on geographical origin. Genotyping data generated for 671 CKAMs on the reference mapping population (Cicer arietinum ICC 4958 X Cicer reticulatum PI 489777) were compiled with 317 unpublished TOG-SNPs and 396 published markers for developing the genetic map. As a result, a second-generation genetic map comprising 1328 marker loci including novel 625 CKAMs, 314 TOG-SNPs and 389 published marker loci with an average inter-marker distance of 0.59 cM was constructed. Detailed analyses of 1064 mapped loci of this second-generation chickpea genetic map showed a higher degree of synteny with genome of Medicago truncatula, followed by Glycine max, Lotus japonicus and least with Vigna unguiculata. Development of these cost-effective CKAMs for SNP genotyping will be useful not only for genetics research and breeding applications in chickpea, but also for utilizing genome information from other sequenced or model legumes.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant type of molecular genetic marker and can be used for producing high-resolution genetic maps, marker-trait association studies and marker-assisted breeding. Large polyploid genomes such as wheat present a challenge for SNP discovery because of the potential presence of multiple homoeologs for each gene. AutoSNPdb has been successfully applied to identify SNPs from Sanger sequence data for several species, including barley, rice and Brassica, but the volume of data required to accurately call SNPs in the complex genome of wheat has prevented its application to this important crop. DNA sequencing technology has been revolutionized by the introduction of next-generation sequencing, and it is now possible to generate several million sequence reads in a timely and cost-effective manner. We have produced wheat transcriptome sequence data using 454 sequencing technology and applied this for SNP discovery using a modified autoSNPdb method, which integrates SNP and gene annotation information with a graphical viewer. A total of 4 694 141 sequence reads from three bread wheat varieties were assembled to identify a total of 38 928 candidate SNPs. Each SNP is within an assembly complete with annotation, enabling the selection of polymorphism within genes of interest.

AB Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) and castor bean (Ricinus communis) possess several taxonomic similarities, and their seeds contain a high proportion of oil (up to 40%) which has been used in various industrial products, including diesel oil. Thirty-two candidate genes responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis were identified in the castor bean genome sequence. Testing of 48 primer pairs from candidate gene regions, including 12 SSRs from castor bean on 54 genotypes of J. curcas, 65% amplified successfully on Jatropha out of which 20% showed polymorphisms. Jatropha genotypes, categorized for oil content, were used in association analysis of candidate gene regions with high oil content. One marker-trait association for the oil trait was identified. Stearoyl desaturase amplicon (700 bp) consisting of intron and exon (P = 0.00013) showed association with high oil content in Jatropha genotypes. Sequencing of the 1.3-kb amplicon, including the 700-bp fragment of stearoyl desaturase, which had shown association with the high oil content, revealed SNPs in the exonic region. The SNPs resulted in substitution of leucine with glutamine in the open reading frame of stearoyl desaturase of low oil content genotypes. The molecular marker is expected to be useful in marker-assisted breeding of high oil content genotypes in Jatropha.

AB Background: The uneven distribution of recombination across the length of chromosomes results in inaccurate estimates of genetic to physical distances. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome 3B, it has been estimated that 90% of the cross over events occur in distal sub-telomeric regions representing 40% of the chromosome. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping which does not rely on recombination is a strategy to map genomes and has been widely employed in animal species and more recently in some plants. RH maps have been proposed to provide i) higher and ii) more uniform resolution than genetic maps, and iii) to be independent of the distribution patterns observed for meiotic recombination. An in vivo RH panel was generated for mapping chromosome 3B of wheat in an attempt to provide a complete scaffold for this similar to 1 Gb segment of the genome and compare the resolution to previous genetic maps.
   Results: A high density RH map with 541 marker loci anchored to chromosome 3B spanning a total distance of 1871.9 cR was generated. Detailed comparisons with a genetic map of similar quality confirmed that i) the overall resolution of the RH map was 10.5 fold higher and ii) six fold more uniform. A significant interaction (r = 0.879 at p = 0.01) was observed between the DNA repair mechanism and the distribution of crossing-over events. This observation could be explained by accepting the possibility that the DNA repair mechanism in somatic cells is affected by the chromatin state in a way similar to the effect that chromatin state has on recombination frequencies in gametic cells.
   Conclusions: The RH data presented here support for the first time in vivo the hypothesis of non-casual interaction between recombination hot-spots and DNA repair. Further, two major hypotheses are presented on how chromatin compactness could affect the DNA repair mechanism. Since the initial RH application 37 years ago, we were able to show for the first time that the iii) third hypothesis of RH mapping might not be entirely correct.

AB To explore the feasibility of constructing a whole genome radiation hybrid (WGRH) map in plant species with large genomes, asymmetric somatic hybridization between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd. was performed. The protoplasts of wheat were irradiated with ultraviolet light (UV) and gamma-ray and rescued by protoplast fusion using B. scorzonerifolium as the recipient. Assessment of SSR markers showed that the radiation hybrids have the average marker retention frequency of 15.5%. Two RH panels (RHPWI and RHPWII) that contained 92 and 184 radiation hybrids, respectively, were developed and used for mapping of 68 SSR markers in chromosome 5A of wheat. A total of 1557 and 2034 breaks were detected in each panel. The RH map of chromosome 5A based on RHPWII was constructed. The distance of the comprehensive map was 2103 cR and the approximate resolution was estimated to be similar to 501.6 kb/break. The RH panels evaluated in this study enabled us to order the ESTs in a single deletion bin or in the multiple bins cross the chromosome. These results demonstrated that RH mapping via protoplast fusion is feasible at the whole genome level for mapping purposes in wheat and the potential value of this mapping approach for the plant species with large genomes.

AB This study presents results confirming the possibility of the application of various combinations of RAPD and ISSR primers in one multiplex PCR for the rye genome and generating a new type of R-ISSR products. The plant material consisted of two inbred lines (Ot0-6 and Ot1-3), F-1 and two bulks (tolerant and susceptible), selected from a population of RILs (F-9) with different responses to stress caused by nutrient deprivation at the seedling stage. In one PCR reaction, the DNA of five genotypes was amplified separately, with RAPD, ISSR, and RAPD+ISSR primers. In total, 28 R-ISSR combinations were tested by combining 20 and 8 appropriately selected RAPD and ISSR primers. 567 loci were amplified, including 230 RAPD, 136 ISSR and 207 amplified R-ISSR loci, of which 114 were new. It was shown that only one ISSR product was identified amongst sequenced R-ISSR products with identical elcctrophoretic mobility as co-migrating RAPDs and ISSRs. The remaining ones had heteroamplicons (R-ISSR) sequences. A similar range of variability was observed both in R-ISSR profiles and in RAPD, as well as in ISSR. The correlation coefficient between the matrices of genetic similarity for five rye genotypes calculated by means of the Mantel test was highly significant r(ABC) = 0.964.

AB The present research is aimed at testing a new retrotransposon-based marker, RAPD-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (R-RAP), which used the combination of RAPD and LTR retrotransposon primers. Banding patterns which are obtained by R-RAP primer combinations were different from amplicons by IRAP and RAPD, demonstrating detection of different genomic regions that are not covered by the other molecular marker systems. The used LTR rertrotransposons had been previously isolated from barley and wheat, hence, twelve accessions of three species of Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, and Aegilops tauschii were used to evaluate the efficiency of this method. Ten polymorphic R-RAP primer combinations generated 141 loci, of which 114 were polymorphic. The studied species were divided with 66 % similarity into 3 clusters according to their species and even some sub-clusters within species. High polymorphism was observed in both between and within species. Polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.28 to 0.40. Reproducibility of each primer combination, tested 4 times in different conditions, was approximately 100%. Agarose gel was used to separate PCR products and showed good resolving ability. We showed that R-RAP can be used as an efficient marker as with other retrotransposon-based markers and can be applied in a similar way for DNA fingerprinting, genetic diversity, genome mapping, and gene tagging in plants. This method also represents a departure for IRAP and RAPD limitations.

AB Genetic variation within homogeneous gene pools in various crops is assumed to be very limited. One objective of this study was to use 144 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to determine if the single-plant lines selected at ultra-low plant density in honeycomb designs within the soybean cultivars Benning, Haskell, and Cook had unique SSR genetic fingerprints. Another objective was to investigate if the variation found was the result of residual genetic heterozygosity that could be detected in the original gene pool where selection initiated. Our results showed that the phenotypic variation for seed protein content and seed weight has a genotypic component identified by the SSR band variation. The 7 lines from Haskell had a total of 63 variant alleles, the 5 lines from Benning had 34 variant alleles, and the 7 lines from Cook had 34 variant alleles, therefore, possessing unique genetic fingerprints. Most of the intracultivar SSR band variation discovered was the result of residual heterozygosity in the initial plant selected to become the cultivar. More specifically, 82% of the SSR variant alleles were traced in the Benning Foundation seed source, 93% in the Haskell seed source, and 82% in the Cook seed source. The remaining variant bands (18% for Benning, 7% for Haskell, and 18% for Cook) could not be detected in the Foundation seed source and were likely the result of mutation or some other mechanism generating de novo variation. These results provide evidence that genetic variation among individual plants is present even in homogeneous gene pools and can be further utilized in breeding programs.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), causing reductions in yield and quality. Marker-based selection for resistance to FHB and lowered deoxynivalenol (DON) grain concentration would save considerable costs and time associated with phenotyping. A marker-based selection approach called genomic selection (GS) uses genomewide marker information to predict genetic value. We used a cross-validation approach that separated training sets from validation sets by both entry and environment. We used this framework to test the potential of GS for genetic improvement of FHB and DON as well as test the effect of different factors on prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy for FHB was found to be as high as 0.72 and that for DON was found to be as high as 0.68. Little difference was found between marker effect estimation methods in terms of prediction of entry genetic value. The extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) present in this population allowed the marker set to be reduced to 384 markers and training population (TP) size to be reduced 200 with little effect on prediction accuracy. We found little to no advantage to combining subpopulations that correspond to neighboring breeding programs to increase TP size. Apparently, little genetic information is shared between subpopulations, either because of different marker-quantitative trait loci (QTL) linkage phases, different segregating QTL, or nonadditive gene action.

AB The transition to flowering in winter wheat requires prolonged exposure to low temperature, a process called vernalization. This process is regulated by a genetic pathway that involves at least three genes, Triticum aestivum VERNALIZATION 1 (TaVRN1), Triticum aestivum VERNALIZATION 2 (TaVRN2) and Triticum aestivum FLOWERING LOCUS T-like 1 (TaFT1). These genes regulate flowering by integrating environmental and developmental cues. To determine whether the expression of these genes is associated with the chromatin methylation state during vernalization in wheat, the level of two markers of histone modifications, the activator histone H3 trimethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and the repressor histone H3 trimethylation of lysine 27 (H3K27me3) were measured at the promoter regions of these three genes. Bioinformatics analysis of these promoters demonstrates the presence of conserved cis-acting elements in the promoters of the three vernalization genes, TaVRN1, TaVRN2 and TaFT1. These elements are targeted by common transcription factors in the vernalization responsive cereals. These promoters also contain the functional "units" PRE/TRE targeted by Polycomb and Trithorax proteins that maintain repressed or active transcription states of developmentally regulated genes. These proteins are known to be associated with the regulation of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Expression studies indicate that TaVRN1 and TaFT1 are up-regulated by vernalization in winter wheat. This up-regulation is associated with increased level of the activator H3K4me3 with no change in the level of the repressor H3K27me3 at the promoter region. This study shows that the flowering transition induced by vernalization in winter wheat is associated with histone methylation at the promoter level of TaVRN1 and TaFT1 while the role of these markers is less evident in TaVRN2 repression. This may represent part of the cellular memory of vernalization in wheat.

AB Powdery mildew is one of the most important wheat diseases in temperate regions of the world. Resistance breeding is considered to be an economical and environmentally benign way to control this disease. The German spring wheat cv. 'Naxos' exhibits high levels of partial and race non-specific resistance to powdery mildew in the field and is a valuable source in resistance breeding. The main objective of the present study was to map the genetic factors behind the resistance in Naxos, based on a population of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a cross with the susceptible CIMMYT breeding line SHA3/CBRD. Powdery mildew severity was evaluated in six field trials in Norway and four field trials in China. The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) with resistance from Naxos was detected close to the Pm3 locus on 1AS in all environments, and explained up to 35% of the phenotypic variation. Naxos was shown to carry another major QTL on 2DL and minor ones on 2BL and 7DS. QTL with resistance from SHA3/CBRD were detected on 1RS, 2DLc, 6BL and 7AL. The QTL on the 1B/1R translocation showed highly variable effects across environments corresponding to known virulence differences against Pm8. SHA3/CBRD was shown to possess the Pm3 haplotype on 1AS, but none of the known Pm3a-g alleles. The RIL population did not provide any evidence to suggest that the Pm3 allele of SHA3/CBRD acted as a suppressor of Pm8.

AB Eyespot is an economically important disease of wheat caused by the soilborne fungi Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis. These pathogens infect and colonize the stem base, which results in lodging of diseased plants and reduced grain yield. Disease resistant cultivars are the most desirable control method, but resistance genes are limited in the wheat gene pool. Some accessions of the wheat wild relative Aegilops longissima are resistant to eyespot, but nothing is known about the genetic control of resistance. A recombinant inbred line population was developed from the cross PI 542196 (R) x PI 330486 (S) to map the resistance genes and better understand resistance in Ae. longissima. A genetic linkage map of the S-l genome was constructed with 169 wheat microsatellite markers covering 1261.3 cM in 7 groups. F-5 lines (189) were tested for reaction to O. yallundae and four QTL were detected in chromosomes 1S(l), 3S(l), 5S(l), and 7S(l). These QTL explained 44 % of the total phenotypic variation in reaction to eyespot based on GUS scores and 63 % for visual disease ratings. These results demonstrate that genetic control of O. yallundae resistance in Ae. longissima is polygenic. This is the first report of multiple QTL conferring resistance to eyespot in Ae. longissima. Markers cfd6, wmc597, wmc415, and cfd2 are tightly linked to Q.Pch.wsu-1S (l) , Q.Pch.wsu-3S (l) , Q.Pch.wsu-5S (l) , and Q.Pch.wsu-7S (l) , respectively. These markers may be useful in marker-assisted selection for transferring resistance genes to wheat to increase the effectiveness of resistance and broaden the genetic diversity of eyespot resistance.

AB Genebanks are entrusted with the storage, preservation and distribution of crop germplasm. Seed longevity is an important character in this context, but little is known regarding its genetic basis, largely because it is so strongly influenced by non-genetic factors. Here we present the outcome of a genetic dissection of seed longevity in bread wheat. We applied both a standard quantitative trait locus analysis based on segregation from a biparental cross, and an association analysis using a germplasm panel to detect marker trait associations. The latter revealed more loci than the former. Some of the genomic regions identified are known to contain genes determining spike architecture or aspects of biotic and abiotic stress responses. The results open perspectives for identification of favourable longevity alleles and the more accurate prediction of seed longevity in cereal germplasm collections.

AB The appearance and spread of races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici with virulence for the Sr31 resistance gene has renewed interest in breeding for durable resistance to stem rust of wheat. Since the occurrence of stem rust has been low in South Africa until the detection of race TTKSF in 2000, breeding for resistance to this disease has not been a primary objective. The aim of this study was to test bread wheat cultivars and lines at the seedling stage for their infection response to stem rust, thus determining their level of resistance or vulnerability. A collection of 65 bread wheat entries was tested with one USA race, two Eastern African races, and three South African races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. The Eastern African and South African races all belong to the Ug99 lineage. The cultivars Duzi, Caledon, Elands, PAN 3364, PAN 3191, SST 047, SST 399, and Steenbras produced resistant infection types (IT < 3) to all races. The molecular marker Sr24#50 indicated the presence of Sr24 in 12 entries. In cultivars resistant to TTTTF, TTKSF, and TTKSP but susceptible to TTKSK and PTKST, the iag95 DNA marker indicated the presence of Sr31 in five wheat lines. Using the cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker csSr2, Sr2 was detected in PAN 3377, Inia, and Steenbras. Few South African wheat cultivars appear to have a broad-based resistance to stem rust, as 88% of the entries were susceptible as seedlings to at least one of the races tested. Diversification of resistance sources and more directed breeding for stem rust resistance are needed in South Africa.

AB A disease (powdery mildew, leaf rust) resistant line was selected from the progenies of a Triticum aestivum x Triticum timopheevii amphiploid produced at Martonvasar. This line was previously identified with C-banding as a 6G(6B) substitution. In order to detect the 6G chromosome in a wheat background, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microsatellite marker analysis were used. Ten microsatellite markers of the 43 tested generated PCR products that were polymorphic between chromosomes 6B and 6G, and four showed length-polymorphism. The FISH hybridization pattern of 6G from T. timopheevii was identified using a combination of four repetitive DNA probes (Afa-family, pSc119.2, pTa71, (GAA)(7)). Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique, capable of labelling the A(t) and G genomes separately, was used on the same slides to differentiate the A(t) and G genomes in T. timopheevii. The A(t) and G genomes of T. timopheevii were grouped on the basis of the GISH patterns and a cyclic intergenomic translocation involving 6A(t)-1G-4G was detected in T. timopheevii accession TRI667. The presence of 6G in the substitution line was demonstrated using FISH with the four repetitive DNA probes. Chromosome 6G was clearly identified and its FISH pattern was different from that of 6B in the parental wheat cultivar Fleischmann-481. According to field tests, the 6G(6B) substitution line has resistance to leaf rust.

AB Grain yield under post-anthesis drought stress is one of the most complex traits, which is inherited quantitatively. The present study was conducted to identify genes determining post-anthesis drought stress tolerance in bread wheat through Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) analysis. Two cultivated bread wheat accessions were selected as parental lines. Population phenotyping was carried out on 133 F-2:3 families. Two field experiments and two experiments in the greenhouse were conducted at IPK-Gatersleben, Germany with control and post-anthesis stress conditions in each experiment. Thousand-grain weight was recorded as the main wheat yield component, which is reduced by post-anthesis drought stress. Chemical desiccation was applied in three experiments as simulator of post-anthesis drought stress whereas water stress was applied in one greenhouse experiment. Analysis of variance showed significant differences among the F-2:3 families. The molecular genetic linkage map including 293 marker loci associated to 19 wheat chromosomes was applied for QTL analysis. The present study revealed four and six QTLs for thousand-grain weight under control and stress conditions, respectively. Only one QTL on chromosome 4BL was common for both conditions. Five QTLs on chromosomes 1AL, 4AL, 7AS, and 7DS were found to be specific to the stress condition. Both parents contributed alleles for drought tolerance. Taking the known reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 4AL/7BS into account, the importance of the short arms of homoeologous group 7 is confirmed for drought stress.

AB Diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L, A(m)A(m)) is an ideal material for induced mutations which can be easily characterized and transferred to polyploid wheats. The EMS-induced brittle culm mutants, brc1, brc2, and brc3 used in the present investigation, were isolated from T. monococcum. All the brittle mutants had brittle roots, leaves, leaf sheaths, culms, and spikes, and were also susceptible to lodging. The mutants had 47-57% reduced alpha-cellulose in the secondary cell walls than that of T. monococcum indicating that all of them had defective synthesis of cellulose. All the mutants were monogenic recessive. Bulk segregation analysis of the mutants, using A(m) genome anchored SSR markers in their F (2) populations with T. boeoticum, located the mutants, brc1, brc2, and brc3 on chromosome 6A, 3A, and 1A of T. monococcum, respectively. Molecular analysis of the putatively linked markers showed that brc1 mapped on chromosome 6AS between Xbarc37 and Xbarc113 markers, brc2 on chromosome 3AL between Xcfd62 and Xcfa2170 markers whereas brc3 mapped on chromosome 1AL between Xgwm135 and Xwmc470 markers. Isolation and mapping of three different brittle culm mutants in wheat for the first time shows that there might be many more genes in wheat which affect synthesis and deposition of cellulose.

AB Speltoid spikes are characterized by pyramidal spike morphology featuring an elongated rachis and tenacious glumes. Speltoids are considered undesirable spike aberrants in wheat breeding leading to increased heterogeneity within a cultivar candidate. As a consequence, the presence of speltoids may result in rejection of a cultivar candidate during official field trials or denial of cultivar certification during seed multiplication. A reliable method is, thus, required to assess the occurrence of speltoids, early on in a wheat breeding program. The domestication gene Q located on the long arm of wheat chromosome 5A is known to suppress the speltoid phenotype in wheat. Here, a quantitative pyrosequencing assay was developed to distinguish between normal wheat plants, which possess two copies of the Q allele, and aberrants, which are either aneuploids lacking the correct number of chromosome 5A copies or plants which carry the primitive q allele. An accurate and reproducible determination of the Q gene copy number was achieved for different wheat genotypes based on homoeologous sequence quantification with two primer combinations at the Q locus. Single plants with one to four copies of the Q allele could be detected by quantitative pyrosequencing which corresponded to the occurrence of speltoid (1 Q allele), normal (2 Q alleles), and compact (more than 2 Q alleles) spikes. Q and q specific alleles could be differentiated at SNP position 2299 of the Q gene. This SNP is assumed to be related to the emergence of free-threshing wheat forms. To our knowledge this is the first report for detection of aneuploids and differentiation of Q alleles in bread wheat using pyrosequencing technology. In future, quantitative pyrosequencing assay can be applied in wheat breeding programs to carry out marker-assisted selection against the presence of speltoid spike aberrants.

AB Powdery mildew (Pm), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most serious diseases for common wheat in many regions around the world. Seeking for new resistance source is urgently required to meet the challenge of the rapid loss of resistance due to the co-evolution of the pathogen's virulence. Wheat line 07jian126 (Triticum aestivum L.) is highly resistant to the Pm disease prevailing in Sichuan province of China. Previous study showed that a SSR marker Xbarc183 was linked to the Pm resistance in 07jian126, which might be controlled by a single dominant gene, designated as Pm07J126. In this study, two additional F-2 populations were used to confirm the linkage between Pm07J126 and Xbarc183. Furthermore, rye chromatin was detected in 07jian126 by molecular analysis of a rye-specific SCAR marker O5 which co-segregated with Pm07J126. This result indicated that Pm07J126 might originate from rye. The reaction patterns to 21 Bgt isolates and molecular marker analysis implied that Pm07J126 might be different from the known rye-derived Pm genes Pm7, Pm8, Pm17 and PmJZHM2RL. Chromosome observation, molecular marker, and A-PAGE analysis suggested that 07jian126 might be a rye introgression line and neither contain 1RS translocation nor secalins gene. Consequently, 07jian126 could be considered as a valuable resource for Pm resistance development of wheat. Besides, the molecular markers Xbarc183 and O5 are useful in marker-assisted selection of Pm07J126 in wheat breeding programs.

AB The location of new genes for resistance to common bunt in wheat is valuable for gene pyramiding in breeding. For this purpose, the genetics of the relatively high level of resistance in the European winter wheat variety Trintella was investigated using a doubled haploid mapping population of a cross between Trintella and the susceptible variety Piko. The population was scored for bunt infection in the field for 2 years following inoculation with a mixture of teliospores of Tilletia tritici and T. laevis. A genetic map consisting of 29 linkage groups was constructed using polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers. This map was used for QTL analysis, and in both years, results indicated that resistance to common bunt could mostly be attributed to a gene on chromosome 1B, near to the centromere and closest to marker Xgwm273 on the short arm. Additionally, in 2008, smaller QTL effects were ascribed to chromosomes 7A and 7B, and another smaller QTL effect to chromosome 5B in 2009 only.

AB Drought tolerance was investigated in 'C306', one of the most drought tolerant wheat cultivars bred in India in the 1960's. An intervarietal mapping population of recombinant inbred lines of the cross 'C306' x 'HUW206' was evaluated for drought tolerance components, namely potential quantum efficiency of photosystem (PS) II (F-v/F-m), chlorophyll content (Chl), flag leaf temperature (Lt), and grain yield per plant (Gyp) under stress. Three independent experiments were conducted under well-watered and water-stressed conditions in greenhouses and growth chambers at Kansas State University (USA). Five hundred and sixty microsatellite markers covering the entire genome were screened for polymorphism between the parents. A QTL (QLt.ksu-1D) for Lt (low flag leaf temperature under stress) on the short arm of chromosome 1D between markers Xbarc271 and Xgwm337 at LOD 3.5 explained 37% of the phenotypic variation. A QTL for F-v/F-m (QF (v) /F (m) .ksu-3B) and Chl (QChl.ksu-3B) controlling quantum efficiency of PS II and chlorophyll content under stress were co-localized on chromosome 3B in the marker interval Xbarc68-Xbarc101 and explained 35-40% of the phenotypic variation for each trait. A QTL (QGyp.ksu-4A) for Gyp on chromosome 4A at a LOD value of 3.2 explained 16.3% of the phenotypic variation. Inconsistent QTLs were observed for F-v/F-m on chromosomes 3A, 6A, 2B, 4B, and 4D; for Chl on 3A, 6A, 2B and 4B; and for Lt on 1A, 3A 6A, 3B and 5B. The identified QTLs give a first glimpse of the genetics of drought tolerance in C306 and need to be validated in field experiments using the marker-phenotype linkages reported here.

AB The ND18 strain of Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infects several lines of Brachypodium distachyon, a recently developed model system for genomics research in cereals. Among the inbred lines tested, Bd3-1 is highly resistant at 20 to 25 degrees C, whereas Bd21 is susceptible and infection results in an intense mosaic phenotype accompanied by high levels of replicating virus. We generated an F-6:7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross between Bd3-1 and Bd21 and used the RILs, and an F-2 population of a second Bd21 X Bd3-1 cross to evaluate the inheritance of resistance. The results indicate that resistance segregates as expected for a single dominant gene, which we have designated Barley stripe mosaic virus resistance 1 (Bsr1). We constructed a genetic linkage map of the RIL population using SNP markers to map this gene to within 705 Kb of the distal end of the top of chromosome 3. Additional CAPS and Indel markers were used to fine map Bsr1 to a 23 Kb interval containing five putative genes. Our study demonstrates the power of using RILs to rapidly map the genetic determinants of BSMV resistance in Brachypodium. Moreover, the RILs and their associated genetic map, when combined with the complete genomic sequence of Brachypodium, provide new resources for genetic analyses of many other traits.

AB Aim. Presently genetic modification of wheat is being carried out mainly through gene gun and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods; both involving tissue culture. This has been a bottleneck since wheat is a recalcitrant crop and hence tissue culture response of most of the varieties has been poor. The aim of current study was to develop an improved Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method that does not involve tissue culturing.
   Methods. The seeds of wheat varieties were soaked in water and incubated overnight at room temperature. Imbibed seeds were wounded with the help of a fine needle and inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing rolB gene in binary vector pLBR. After co-cultivation, the seeds were processed for regeneration. The seedlings were subjected to kanamycin selection and potential transformants were transferred to soil for further growth in natural environment.
   Results. We have successfully obtained transformants on the basis of antibiotic resistance. Transformation efficiencies of the selected varieties used, i.e., khyber-87 and Inqilab-91 were 4% and 4.67%, respectively. Moreover, we also optimized the protocol for selection of transformants with kanamycin.
   Conclusion. The protocol developed for wheat transformation is simple, inexpensive, and most importantly by-passes tissue culturing. The application of this protocol will be extremely beneficial in creating transgenic wheat with desirable traits.

AB Microprojectile bombardment mediated genetic transformation parameters have been standardized for seed derived callus of Eleusine coracana. Plasmid pCAMBIA 1381 harboring hygromycin phosphotransferase (hptII) as selectable marker gene and beta-glucuronidase (gus A) as reporter gene, was used for the optimization of gene transfer conditions. The transient GUS expression and survival of putative transformants were taken into consideration for the assessment of parameters. Optimum conditions for the microprojectile bombardment mediated genetic transformation of finger millet were 1,100 psi rupture disk pressure with 3 cm distance from rupture disk to macrocarrier and 12 cm microprojectile travel distance. Double bombardment with gold particles of 1.0 mu m size provided maximum transient GUS expression and transformation efficiency. Osmotic treatment of callus with 0.4 M sorbitol enhanced efficiency of particle bombardment mediated genetic transformation. Regenerative calli were bombarded at optimum conditions of bombardment and placed on regeneration medium with hygromycin to obtain transformed plants. The integration of hptII and gus A genes was confirmed with PCR amplification of 684 and 634 bp sizes of the bands respectively from putative transformants and Southern blot hybridization using PCR amplified DIG labeled hptII gene as probe. PCR analysis with hptII gene specific primers indicated the presence of transgene in T-1 generation plants. Thus a successful genetic transformation system was developed using particle bombardment in E. coracana with 45.3% transformation efficiency. The protocol will be helpful for the introgression of desired genes into E. coracana.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the major abiotic constraints influencing production of high quality grain. Selection for pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) resistance in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in early generations is difficult because it is expressed as a quantitatively inherited trait and subject to environmental effects. The objectives of this study were to validate a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for PHS resistance on chromosome 4A in bread wheat and to isolate near-isogenic lines for this QTL using marker-assisted selection. A total of 60 Canadian wheat cultivars and experimental lines were screened with three SSR markers in a QTL region for PHS resistance. The SSR markers DuPw004, barc170 and wmc650 explained 67%, 75% and 60% of total variation in germination (%), respectively, among different wheat genotypes. Marker assisted back crossing with DuPw004 reduced the population size in BC1F1 and BC2F1 generation by 41% and 59%, respectively. A survey of pedigrees of different genotypes revealed that the parental line RL4137 is a major source of increased PHS resistance in a number of western Canadian wheat cultivars. Microsatellite markers (DuPw004, barc170 and wmc650) will be useful for plant breeders to pyramid QTL from different PHS resistance sources.

AB Genetic diversity was examined in a collection of 263 Indian bread wheat ( L.) cultivars using 90 SSR markers. These cultivars were classified into Group I (pre-green revolution cultivars) and Group II cultivars (post-green revolution cultivars). SSR markers were also classified into Set-I SSRs (42 random genomic SSRs) and Set-II SSRs (48 SSRs associated with QTLs for grain weight). The SSRs belonging to Set-II exhibited relatively low level of polymorphism, suggesting that the SSRs associated with QTL for grain weight in wheat were probably under selection pressure during wheat breeding. AMOVA indicated that proportion of the variation within each of the two groups of cultivars accounted for most (87.59%) of the molecular variance, while the variation between the two groups of cultivars accounted for only 12.41% of the variance. The estimates of the average number of alleles/locus and gene diversity due to each of the two sets of SSRs suggested increase in overall genetic diversity after green revolution in Indian bread wheat cultivars. Differences were also observed in genetic diversity among cultivars from each of the six wheat growing agro-climatic zones of India. However, decade-wise analysis of genetic diversity among the post-green revolution cultivars indicated a progressive decline in genetic diversity, thus suggesting a need for involving diverse exotic, synthetic and winter wheat germplasm in Indian wheat breeding programs.

AB DNA markers have the potential to be a powerful tool for the molecular study and breeding of agronomic traits of temperate forage grasses, but some of these grasses have only limited sequence information available. We aimed to design highly transferable primer sets by using the abundant sequence information available for related crop species such as wheat and rice. The degree of similarity between the primer sequences of the wheat PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) primer set and the corresponding sequences of rice orthologs was designated as the "universality index" (UI). We classified 359 PLUG primer pairs based on their UI values and found that primer pairs with high UI values showed higher successful amplification rates in Festuca and Lolium species than those with low UI values. Based on these results, we designed new primer sets, designated Conserved Three-prime-End Region (COTER) primers, with complete similarity to rice orthologs for eight bases at the 3' end of each primer. COTER primer sets developed from both tall fescue and wheat showed high transferability in six temperate grasses (mean amplification rates of 95% for tall fescue primers; 79% for wheat primers). This strategy and primer information could also be useful for developing DNA markers for other grass species with little genome information available.

AB Winter wheat requires vernalization, a long exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures, to promote reproductive development. The vernalization requirement in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is mainly controlled by the Vrn-1 genes that are located on chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D. Dominant alleles confer spring habit and are epistatic to the recessive winter alleles which means that spring varieties carry at least one dominant allele. To date, two dominant and one recessive Vrn-B1 alleles have been described. Vrn-B1a (formerly designated as Vrn-B1) differs from the winter vrn-B1 allele by a large deletion in intron 1. Vrn-B1b has an additional small deletion and is probably derived from Vrn-B1a. The novel allele described here and designated as Vrn-B1c also has a large deletion within intron 1 but with different breakpoints from Vrn-B1a or b, and sequence duplication, showing that this is an independently derived spring allele. By combining an exon 1 primer with previously published PCR primers it was possible to develop a multiplex PCR that distinguished all four alleles simultaneously. The multiplex PCR was validated by testing 320 winter wheat and 137 spring wheat varieties. This demonstrated that the novel Vrn-B1c allele was present in 25 spring varieties of diverse origin, showing this allele to be widely distributed.

AB The objectives of the research were to determine the position of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for alpha-amylase activity on the genetic map of a rye recombinant inbred line population-S120 x S76-and to compare them to known QTL for preharvest sprouting and heading earliness. Fourteen QTL for alpha-amylase activity on all seven chromosomes were identified. The detected QTL were responsible for 6.09-23.32% of alpha-amylase activity variation. The lowest LOD value (2.22) was achieved by locus QAa4R-M3 and the highest (7.79) by locus QAa7R-M1. Some QTL intervals for features of interest overlapped partially or completely. There were six overlapping QTL for alpha-amylase activity and preharvest sprouting (on 1R, 3R, 4R, 6R, 7R) and the same number for preharvest sprouting and heading earliness (on 1R, 2R, 6R, 7R). Furthermore, there was one interval partially common to all three traits, mapped on the long arm of chromosome 1R. Testing of lines originating from hybrid breeding programs, such as S120 and S76, may provide important information about the most significant genes and markers for selection in commercial breeding. Among the statistically significant markers selected in the Kruskal-Wallis test (P < 0.005), there were 55 common ones for preharvest sprouting and heading earliness (1R, 2R, 6R), 30 markers coinciding between alpha-amylase activity and preharvest sprouting (5R, 7R) and one marker for alpha-amylase activity and heading earliness (6R).

AB Following the appearance of stripe rust in South Africa in 1996, efforts have been made to identify new sources of durable resistance. The French cultivar Cappelle-Desprez has long been considered a source of durable, adult plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust. As Cappelle-Desprez contains the seedling resistance genes and wheat lines were developed from which and had been removed, while selecting for Cappelle-Desprez derived APR effective against South African pathotypes of the stripe rust fungus, f. sp Line Yr16DH70, adapted to South African wheat growing conditions, was selected and crossed to the stripe rust susceptible cultivar Palmiet to develop a segregating recombinant inbred line mapping population. A major effect QTL, - was identified on the short arm of chromosome 2A derived from Cappelle-Desprez, along with three QTL of smaller effect, -- and -- was located within a region on the short arm of chromosome 2D believed to be the location of the stripe rust resistance gene . An additional minor effect QTL, - was identified in the cv. Palmiet. An examination of individual RILs carrying single or combinations of each QTL indicated significant resistance effects when - was combined with the three minor QTL from Cappelle-Desprez, and between - and -.

AB Paspalum notatum Flugge is a grass species organized as an agamic complex. The objective of the current research was to survey the frequencies and variation of cytosine methylation at CCGG sequences in diploid and tetraploid genotypes, and to determine the occurrence of methylation changes associated with tetraploidization by using methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) markers. No differences were found in the average proportions of methylated CCGG sites between cytotypes, but methylation patterns were significantly more variable in tetraploids. In both groups of plants, epigenetic and non-epigenetic variation correlated significantly when compared by Mantel tests. The evaluation of 159 common MSAP markers showed that 18.86 % of them differed in their methylation status in the different ploidies. Dendrogram analysis, reflecting epigenetic distances, showed that the four diploids and one experimentally-obtained sexually-reproducing tetraploid, grouped together. MSAP analysis performed on a diploid plant and its autotetraploid derivative showed that new epialleles emerged after tetraploidization. Sequencing of several MASP markers showed homologies with low copy genes, non-coding sequences and transposon/retrotransposon elements.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) is one of the most abundant chloroplast proteins in plants. Its main function is to collect and transfer light energy to photosynthetic reaction centers. However, the roles of different LHCPs in light-harvesting antenna systems remain obscure. Exploration of nucleotide variation in the genes encoding LHCP can facilitate a better understanding of the functions of LHCP. In this study, nucleotide variations in Lhcb1, a LHCP gene in barley, were investigated across 292 barley accessions collected from 35 different countries using EcoTILLING technology, a variation of the Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes (TILLING). A total of 23 nucleotide variations were detected including three insert/deletions (indels) and 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Among them, 17 SNPs were in the coding region with nine missense changes. Two SNPs with missense changes are predicted to be deleterious to protein function. Seventeen SNP formed 31 distinguishable haplotypes in the barley collection. The levels of nucleotide diversity in the Lhcb1 locus differed markedly with geographic origins and species of accessions. The accessions from Middle East Asia exhibited the highest nucleotide and haplotype diversity. H. spontaneum showed greater nucleotide diversity than H. vulgare. Five SNPs in Lhcb1 were significantly associated with at least one of the six agronomic traits evaluated, namely plant height, spike length, number of grains per spike, thousand grain weight, flag leaf area and leaf color, and these SNPs may be used as potential markers for improvement of these barley traits.

AB Background: Bread wheat, one of the world's staple food crops, has the largest, highly repetitive and polyploid genome among the cereal crops. The wheat genome holds the key to crop genetic improvement against challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, and water scarcity. To unravel the complex wheat genome, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) is pursuing a chromosome-and chromosome arm-based approach to physical mapping and sequencing. Here we report on the use of a BAC library made from flow-sorted telosomic chromosome 3A short arm (t3AS) for marker development and analysis of sequence composition and comparative evolution of homoeologous genomes of hexaploid wheat.
   Results: The end-sequencing of 9,984 random BACs from a chromosome arm 3AS-specific library (TaaCsp3AShA) generated 11,014,359 bp of high quality sequence from 17,591 BAC-ends with an average length of 626 bp. The sequence represents 3.2% of t3AS with an average DNA sequence read every 19 kb. Overall, 79% of the sequence consisted of repetitive elements, 1.38% as coding regions (estimated 2,850 genes) and another 19% of unknown origin. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that 70-77% of the genes present in both 3A and 3B were syntenic with model species. Among the transposable elements, gypsy/sabrina (12.4%) was the most abundant repeat and was significantly more frequent in 3A compared to homoeologous chromosome 3B. Twenty novel repetitive sequences were also identified using de novo repeat identification. BESs were screened to identify simple sequence repeats (SSR) and transposable element junctions. A total of 1,057 SSRs were identified with a density of one per 10.4 kb, and 7,928 junctions between transposable elements (TE) and other sequences were identified with a density of one per 1.39 kb. With the objective of enhancing the marker density of chromosome 3AS, oligonucleotide primers were successfully designed from 758 SSRs and 695 Insertion Site Based Polymorphisms (ISBPs). Of the 96 ISBP primer pairs tested, 28 (29%) were 3A-specific and compared to 17 (18%) for 96 SSRs.
   Conclusion: This work reports on the use of wheat chromosome arm 3AS-specific BAC library for the targeted generation of sequence data from a particular region of the huge genome of wheat. A large quantity of sequences were generated from the A genome of hexaploid wheat for comparative genome analysis with homoeologous B and D genomes and other model grass genomes. Hundreds of molecular markers were developed from the 3AS arm-specific sequences; these and other sequences will be useful in gene discovery and physical mapping.

AB Wild Triticeae grasses serve as important gene pools for forage and cereal crops. Based on DNA sequences of genome-specific RAPD markers, sequence-tagged site (STS) markers specific for W and Y genomes have been obtained. Coupling with the use of genomic in situ hybridization, these STS markers enabled the identification of the W- and Y-genome chromosomes in backcross derivatives from hybrids of bread wheat Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 42; AABBDD) and Elymus rectisetus (Nees in Lehm.) A. Love & Connor (2n = 42; StStWWYY). The detection of six different alien chromosomes in five of these derivatives was ascertained by quantitative PCR of STS markers, simple sequence repeat markers, rDNA genes, and (or) multicolor florescence in situ hybridization. Disomic addition line 4687 (2n = 44) has the full complement of 42 wheat chromosomes and a pair of 1Y chromosomes that carry genes for resistance to tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs.) and Stagonospora nodorum blotch (caused by Stagonospora nodorum (Berk.) Castellani and Germano). The disomic addition line 4162 has a pair of 1St chromosomes and 21 pairs of wheat chromosomes. Lines 4319 and 5899 are two triple substitution lines (2n = 42) having the same chromosome composition, with 2A, 4B, and 6D of wheat substituted by one pair of W- and two pairs of St-genome chromosomes. Line 4434 is a substitution-addition line (2n = 44) that has the same W- and St-genome chromosomes substituting 2A, 4B, and 6D of wheat as in lines 4319 and 5899 but differs by having an additional pair of Y-genome chromosome, which is not the 1Y as in line 4687. The production and identification of these alien cytogenetic stocks may help locate and isolate genes for useful agronomic traits.

The Dutch cultivar 'Vada' (released in the 1950s) and parents, 'Hordeum laevigatum' and 'Gull' ('Gold'), along with the related cultivar 'Emir' (a derivative of 'Delta'), were assessed for APR to P. hordei in a disease screening nursery. The marker bPb-0837-PCR, co-located with Rph20 on the short arm of chromosome 5H (5HS), was used to screen genotypes for the resistance allele, Rph20.ai. Results from phenotypic assessment and DNA analysis confirmed that Rph20 originated from the landrace 'H. laevigatum' (i.e., Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare). Tracing back this gene through the pedigrees of two-rowed barley cultivars, indicated that Rph20 has contributed APR to P. hordei for more than 60 years. Although there have been no reports of an Rph20-virulent pathotype, the search for alternative sources of APR should continue to avoid widespread reliance upon a single resistance factor.

AB Fusarium equiseti (Corda) Saccardo is a soil saprophyte and a weak pathogen, associated with several diseases of fruit and other crops in subtropical and tropical areas, but also in countries with temperate climate. A wide range of secondary metabolites has been identified among natural F. equiseti populations, with zearalenone (ZEA), fusarochromanone and fusarenon-X being the most common. In present study, the genetic diversity of strains from two populations (from Italy and Poland) was evaluated by analysing the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef-1 alpha) sequences, two polyketide synthases from the ZEA biosynthetic pathway (PKS13 and PKS4) and the TRI5 gene from the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway. ZEA was produced in rice cultures by 20 of the 27 tested isolates in concentrations ranging from 1.34 ng/g to 34,000 ng/g). The ability to produce enniatins and trichothecenes was evaluated in all strains by identifying esyn1, TRI13 and TRI4 genes. The presence of PKS4 and PKS13 genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in only some ZEA-producing isolates. Similarly, the TRI5 gene was found in 14 of the 27 isolates tested. This is likely to have been caused by the divergence of those genes between F. equiseti and F. graminearum (the latter species was used for the primers design) and can be exploited in phylogenetic studies. The analysis of the mycotoxin biosynthetic gene sequences can be used to differentiate the studied genotypes even more precisely than the analysis of the non-coding regions (like tef-1 alpha).

AB The new stem rust race Ug99 is an alarming threat to the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production of the world for the very fact that it overcomes many of the known Sr genes including the most commonly used genes such as Sr31, ST24, and Sr36. The wheat breeding program at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) has distributed the first stem rust resistant spring wheat yield trials composed of 24 wheat genotypes for the Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region to identify high yielding wheat genotypes, which can be recommended for direct release and/or parentage purposes by the National Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs). The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis of variance for grain yield (kg ha(-1)) of 24 wheat genotypes tested in 15 environments showed that wheat grain yield was significantly (p < 0.01) affected by environments (E), genotypes (G), and genotype x environment interaction (GEI). From the total sum of squares due to treatments (G + E + GEI), E contributed 90.1% and GEI accounted for 8.3% while G effect represented only 1.6%. According to AMMI2 estimate, Baasha-14 and Amir-2 with mean grain yield levels of 5168 and 5127 kg ha(-1), respectively, are identified as the best genotypes with high yield potential across a wide range of environments. Based on correlation and clustering analysis among environments, the Ghab site in Syria (E7) is identified as the highest yielding and best correlated site and therefore it is recommended as a key location for evaluation of wheat germplasm yield potential in ICARDA's wheat breeding program. We recommend the high yielding and Ug99 resistant genotypes identified in this study for direct release as replacement of the susceptible varieties by the respective NARS and/or to be used as parents at ICARDA and by NARS collaborators.

AB Powdery mildew is a major fungal disease in wheat, especially in cool maritime climates. A novel Aegilops tauschii Coss.-derived wheat powdery mildew resistance gene present in the germplasm line NC96BGTD1 was genetically characterized as a monogenic trait in field trials using F-2- and F-4-derived lines from a NC96BGTD1 x 'Saluda' cross. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map and tag the resistance gene present in NC96BGTD1. Two dominant SSR markers flanking the resistance gene were identified. Xgwm635 mapped 5.5 and 8.3 cM distal to the resistance gene in the F-2 and F-4 generations, respectively. Xgpw328 mapped 16.2 cM proximal to the resistance gene in the F-2 and 13.6 cM proximal to the resistance gene in the F-4 generation. These SSR markers were previously mapped to the short arm of chromosome 7D and their positions were confirmed using Chinese Spring aneuploid and deletion stocks. Significant segregation distortion was observed in the F-4 generation with markers distal to the resistance gene showing a preference for the A. tauschii alleles while markers proximal to the resistance gene showed less significant preference for Saluda alleles. Only the adult plant resistance gene Pm38 has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 7D but to a more proximal position than the gene in NC96BGTD1. The resistance gene described herein should be temporarily designated MINCD1.

AB Two sets of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and their respective founder parents (St2422/464 and Abbondanza) in China were genotyped at 481 microsatellite loci. The selection sweeps detected almost completely overlapped with one another across the two sets on the 21 chromosomes although a cluster analysis showed that they do represent distinct subpopulations with F-st = 0.0734 (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.1, log(10)p = 5). About 38.7% of the loci appeared to have experienced some selection sweep. Important agronomic traits were usually associated with these selection sweep valleys. The alleles present at key loci in these valleys were often in common between the two founders. Marker trait association based on three seasons of field data suggested the association of one, four, and six loci with, respectively, the number of fertile tillers per plant, grain number per spike, and thousand grain weight. Five, 14, and 21 loci were associated with the three yield components in two of the three seasons. We suggest that the breeding potential of a line can be predicted from its allelic state at certain critical marker loci, which represent major targets for breeding by design in wheat. Genotypic descriptions of major cultivars and the analytical approach we have described here provide a path toward the a priori selection of favorable breeding parents.

AB Historically in plant breeding a large number of statistical models has been developed and used for studying genotype x environment interaction. These models have helped plant breeders to assess the stability of economically important traits and to predict the performance of newly developed genotypes evaluated under varying environmental conditions. In the last decade, the use of relatively low numbers of markers has facilitated the mapping of chromosome regions associated with phenotypic variability (e. g., QTL mapping) and, to a lesser extent, revealed the differetial response of these chromosome regions across environments (i.e., QTL x environment interaction). QTL technology has been useful for marker-assisted selection of simple traits; however, it has not been efficient for predicting complex traits affected by a large number of loci. Recently the appearance of cheap, abundant markers has made it possible to saturate the genome with high density markers and use marker information to predict genomic breeding values, thus increasing the precision of genetic value prediction over that achieved with the traditional use of pedigree information. Genomic data also allow assessing chromosome regions through marker effects and studying the pattern of covariablity of marker effects across differential environmental conditions. In this review, we outline the most important models for assessing genotype x environment interaction, QTL x environment interaction, and marker effect (gene) x environment interaction. Since analyzing genetic and genomic data is one of the most challenging statistical problems researchers currently face, different models from different areas of statistical research must be attempted in order to make significant progress in understanding genetic effects and their interaction with environment.

AB Changes in essential dietary components alter global gene expression patterns in animals. We reported on a proteomics study designed to identify molecular markers of deficiencies in culture media developed for the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. In that study, we found significant changes in expression of 70 proteins in adults of larvae reared on media lacking wheat germ oil (WGO), compared to media supplemented with WGO. Of these, a gene encoding an insect chitin-binding protein was expressed at about 120-fold higher levels in adult males reared on media supplemented with WGO. We inferred it may be feasible to develop the gene as a molecular marker of dietary lipid deficiency. The work was focused, however, on analysis of 11 day old adults. We have no information on expression of the chitin-binding protein, nor on any other proteins at other adult ages. In this paper we address the idea that the whole animal proteome changes dynamically with age. We reared separate groups of fruit fly larvae on media with and without WGO supplementation and analyzed protein expression in adult males and females age 0, 4, 8 and 12 days old using 2D electrophoresis. Gel densitometry revealed significant increases (by >2-fold) and decreases (by >50%) in expression levels of 29 proteins in females and 10 in males. We identified these proteins by mass spectrometry on MALDI TOF/TOF and bioinformatic analyses of the protein sequences. Two proteins, peroxiredoxin (26-fold increase) and vitellogenin 1 (15-fold increase) increased in expression in day 8 females. The key finding is that most changes in protein expression occurred in day 8 females. We infer that the fruit fly proteome changes with adult age. The natural changes in proteome with adult age is a crucial aspect of developing these and other proteins into molecular markers of lipid deficiency in fruit flies and possibly other insect species.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat worldwide. The dominant powdery mildew resistance gene PmAS846 was transferred to the hexaploid wheat lines N9134 and N9738 from wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) in 1995, and it is still one of the most effective resistance genes in China. A high resolution genetic map for PmAS846 locus was constructed using two F-2 populations and corresponding F-2:3 families developed from the crosses of N9134/Shaanyou 225 and N9738/Huixianhong. Synteny between wheat and Brachypodium distachyon and rice was used to develop closely linked molecular markers to reduce the genetic interval around PmAS846. Twenty-six expressed sequence tag-derived markers were mapped to the PmAS846 locus. Five markers co-segregated with PmAS846 in the F-2 population of N9134/Shaanyou 225. PmAS846 was physically located to wheat chromosome 5BL bin 0.75-0.76 within a gene-rich region. The markers order is conserved between wheat and Brachypodium distachyon, but rearrangements are present in rice. Two markers, BJ261635 and CJ840011 flanked PmAS846 and narrowed PmAS846 to a region that is collinear with 197 and 112 kb genomic regions on Brachypodium chromosome 4 and rice chromosome 9, respectively. The genes located on the corresponding homologous regions in Brachypodium, rice and barley could be considered for further marker saturation and identification of potential candidate genes for PmAS846. The markers co-segregating with PmAS846 provide a potential target site for positional cloning of PmAS846, and can be used for marker-assisted selection of this gene.

AB It is widely believed that hexaploid wheat originated via hybridization of hulled tetraploid emmer with Aegilops tauschii (genomes DD) and that the nascent hexaploid was spelt, from which free-threshing wheat evolved by mutations. To reassess the role of spelt in the evolution of Triticum aestivum, 4 disomic substitution lines of Ae. tauschii chromosome 2D in Chinese Spring wheat were developed and one of them was used to map the Tg locus, which controls glume tenacity in Ae. tauschii, relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) and expressed sequence tag loci on wheat chromosome 2D. The segregation of SSR markers was used to assess the presence of Tg alleles in 11 accessions of spelt, both from Europe and from Asia. Ten of them had an inactive tg allele in the D genome and most had an active Tg allele in the B genome. This is consistent with spelt being derived from free-threshing hexaploid wheat by hybridization of free-threshing wheat with hulled emmer. It is proposed that the tetraploid parent of hexaploid wheat was not hulled emmer but a free-threshing form of tetraploid wheat.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, has been an important disease of winter wheat (Tritium aestivum) in the eastern United States since 2000, when a new strain of the pathogen emerged. The new strain overcame the widely used resistance gene, Yr9, and was more aggressive and better adapted to warmer temperatures than the old strain. Host resistance is the most effective approach to manage stripe rust. Winter wheat lines with resistance to the new strain in the field are common, but the genes conferring this resistance are mostly unknown. The objectives of this research were to characterize the all-stage resistance and adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in a representative group of contemporary winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines and to identify the resistance genes when possible. Of the 50 lines evaluated for all-stage resistance at the seedling stage, nearly all were susceptible to the new strain. Based on a linked molecular marker, seven lines had resistance gene Yr17 that confers resistance to both old and new strains; however, this resistance was difficult to identify in the seedling stage. Of the 19 lines evaluated for APR, all expressed APR compared with a very susceptible check. Nine had race-specific APR to the new strain and nine had APR to both old and new strains. The remaining line, 26R61, had all-stage resistance to the old strain (conferred by resistance gene Yr9) and a high level of APR to the new strain. APR was expressed as low infection type, low percent leaf area diseased, and long latent period at heading stage under both low and high temperature regimes and could be identified as early as jointing stage. Based on tests for linked molecular markers, the most widely used slow-rusting APR genes, Yr18 and Yr29, were not present in any of the lines. The results of this research indicate that effective all-stage resistance was conferred only by Yr17 and that APR was common and likely conferred by unknown race-specific genes rather than genes conferring slow rusting that are more likely to be durable.

AB Barley is one of the world's most important crops providing food and related products for millions of people. Diseases continue to pose a serious threat to barley production, despite the use of fungicides and resistant varieties, highlighting the impact of fungicide resistance and the breakdown of host plant resistance on the efficacy of control measures. This paper reviews progress towards an integrated approach for disease management in barley in which new methods may be combined with existing measures to improve the efficacy of control in the long-term. Advances have been made in genetic mapping of resistance (R) genes and in identifying novel sources of genes in wild barley populations and land races. Marker assisted selection techniques are being used to pyramid R genes to increase the durability of resistance. Elicitors to induce host resistance used in combination with fungicides can provide effective disease control in the field and could delay the evolution of fungicide insensitivity. Traits that may contribute to disease tolerance and escape have been identified and the extent of genetic variation within barley germplasm is being determined. Tools are being developed to integrate the above methods via an assessment of the risk of economic injury occurring from disease to guide decisions on the requirement for fungicide treatment. Barriers exist to the adoption of integrated management approaches from growers and end-users further down the supply chain (e.g. acceptance of variety mixtures) and policy incentives from government may be required for it to be taken up in practice.

AB Appropriate selection of parents for the development of mapping populations is pivotal to maximizing the power of quantitative trait loci detection. Trait genotypic variation within a family is indicative of the family's informativeness for genetic studies. Accurate prediction of the most useful parental combinations within a species would help guide quantitative genetics studies. We tested the reliability of genotypic and phenotypic distance estimators between pairs of maize inbred lines to predict genotypic variation for quantitative traits within families derived from biparental crosses. We developed 25 families composed of similar to 200 random recombinant inbred lines each from crosses between a common reference parent inbred, B73, and 25 diverse maize inbreds. Parents and families were evaluated for 19 quantitative traits across up to 11 environments. Genetic distances (GDs) among parents were estimated with 44 simple sequence repeat and 2303 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. GDs among parents had no predictive value for progeny variation, which is most likely due to the choice of neutral markers. In contrast, we observed for about half of the traits measured a positive correlation between phenotypic parental distances and within-family genetic variance estimates. Consequently, the choice of promising segregating populations can be based on selecting phenotypically diverse parents. These results are congruent with models of genetic architecture that posit numerous genes affecting quantitative traits, each segregating for allelic series, with dispersal of allelic effects across diverse genetic material. This architecture, common to many quantitative traits in maize, limits the predictive value of parental genotypic or phenotypic values on progeny variance.

AB Leaf rust and stripe rust are important diseases of wheat world-wide and deployment of cultivars with genetic resistance is an effective and environmentally sound control method. The use of minor, additive genes conferring adult plant resistance (APR) has been shown to provide resistance that is durable. The wheat cultivar 'Pastor' originated from the CIMMYT breeding program that focuses on minor gene-based APR to both diseases by selecting and advancing generations alternately under leaf rust and stripe rust pressures. As a consequence, Pastor has good resistance to both rusts and was used as the resistant parent to develop a mapping population by crossing with the susceptible 'Avocet'. All 148 F-5 recombinant inbred lines were evaluated under artificially inoculated epidemic environments for leaf rust (3 environments) and stripe rust (4 environments, 2 of which represent two evaluation dates in final year due to the late build-up of a new race virulent to Yr31) in Mexico. Map construction and QTL analysis were completed with 223 polymorphic markers on 84 randomly selected lines in the population. Pastor contributed Yr31, a moderately effective race-specific gene for stripe rust resistance, which was overcome during this study, and this was clearly shown in the statistical analysis. Linked or pleiotropic chromosomal regions contributing to resistance against both pathogens included Lr46/Yr29 on 1BL, the Yr31 region on 2BS, and additional minor genes on 5A, 6B and 7BL. Other minor genes for leaf rust resistance were located on 1B, 2A and 2D and for stripe rust on 1AL, 1B, 3A, 3B, 4D, 6A, 7AS and 7AL. The 1AL, 1BS and 7AL QTLs are in regions that were not identified previously as having QTLs for stripe rust resistance. The development of uniform and severe epidemics facilitated excellent phenotyping, and when combined with multi-environment analysis, resulted in the relatively large number of QTLs identified in this study.

AB In the cross of the durable leaf rust resistant wheat Sinvalocho MA and the susceptible line Gama6, four specific genes were identified: the seedling resistance gene Lr3, the adult plant resistance (APR) genes LrSV1 and LrSV2 coming from Sinvalocho MA, and the seedling resistance gene LrG6 coming from Gama6. Lr3 was previously mapped on 6BL in the same cross. LrSV1 was mapped on chromosome 2DS where resistance genes Lr22a and Lr22b have been reported. Results from rust reaction have shown that LrSV1 from Sinvalocho is not the same allele as Lr22b and an allelism test with Lr22a showed that they could be alleles or closely linked genes. LrSV1 was mapped in an 8.5-cM interval delimited by markers gwm296 distal and gwm261 proximal. Adult gene LrSV2 was mapped on chromosome 3BS, cosegregating with gwm533 in a 7.2-cM interval encompassed by markers gwm389 and gwm493, where other disease resistance genes are located, such as seedling gene Lr27 for leaf rust, Sr2 for stem rust, QTL Qfhs.ndsu-3BS for resistance to Fusarium gramineum and wheat powdery mildew resistance. The gene LrG6 was mapped on chromosome 2BL, with the closest marker gwm382 at 0.6 cM. Lines carrying LrSV1, LrSV2 and LrG6 tested under field natural infection conditions, showed low disease infection type and severity, suggesting that this kind of resistance can be explained by additive effects of APR and seedling resistance genes. The identification of new sources of resistance from South American land races and old varieties, supported by modern DNA technology, contributes to sustainability of agriculture through plant breeding.

AB Transposable elements (TEs) account for up to 80% of the wheat genome and are considered one of the main drivers of wheat genome evolution. However, the contribution of TEs to the divergence and evolution of wheat genomes is not fully understood. In this study, we have developed 55 miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) markers that are based on the presence/absence of an element, with over 60% of these 55 MITE insertions associated with wheat genes. We then applied these markers to assess genetic diversity among Triticum and Aegilops species, including diploid (AA, BB and DD genomes), tetraploid (BBAA genome) and hexaploid (BBAADD genome) species. While 18.2% of the MITE markers showed similar insertions in all species indicating that those are fossil insertions, 81.8% of the markers showed polymorphic insertions among species, subspecies, and accessions. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis based on MITE markers revealed that species were clustered based on genus, genome composition, and ploidy level, while 47.13% genetic divergence was observed between the two main clusters, diploids versus polyploids. In addition, we provide evidence for MITE dynamics in wild emmer populations. The use of MITEs as evolutionary markers might shed more light on the origin of the B-genome of polyploid wheat.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective approach to control the disease. To determine inheritance of stripe rust resistance and map the resistance gene in a common wheat line D31, developed from Triticum sphaerococcum Perc. (accession number AS348), F-1, F-2, and BC1 progenies derived from the Taichung 29 x D31 cross were firstly inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR32 during whole growth stages under the field conditions. Genetic analysis indicated that the resistance to CYR32 in the line D31 was conferred by one recessive gene, temporarily designated as YrSph. A total of 400 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 315 pairs of sequence-related amplified polymorphism and 42 pairs of target region amplified polymorphism markers were screened, and four SSR markers and three TRAP markers were found to be polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible DNA bulks as well as their parents. Genetic linkage was tested on segregating F-2 population and indicated that all of the ten markers were linked to the resistance gene, two of which flanked the locus at 8.5 and 6.9 cM, respectively. The SSR markers mapped the resistance gene on chromosome arm 2AS. The results of chromosome location and pedigree analysis indicate that YrSph was probably a novel stripe rust resistance gene.

AB The Swedish winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Folke has a long record of partial and race non-specific resistance to powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) in the field. The aim of the present study was to map the main genetic factors behind the partial resistance in Folke and identify molecular markers for use in marker-assisted selection. A population of 130 recombinant inbred lines was developed from a cross between Folke and the moderately susceptible spring wheat line T2038. The population was tested for powdery mildew resistance over two years at two locations in Norway and genotyped with DArT and SSR markers. Composite interval mapping detected a total of eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) for powdery mildew resistance; six with resistance from Folke on 2BS, 2DL, 5AL, 5BS and 6BS and two with resistance from T2038 on 5BS and 7AL. None of the loci with resistance from Folke mapped to chromosomal regions with known race-specific resistance genes, which confirmed the race non-specific nature of the resistance in this cultivar. The molecular markers linked to the reported QTL will be useful as a tool for selecting partial and potentially durable resistance to powdery mildew based on the resistance in Folke.

Kharoba was selected from the doubled haploids derived from the cross 'Altar 84'/Aegilops squarrosa 221//'Pastor'/3/k134(6)/'Veery'//'Bobwhite'/'Pavon'/4/'Tilila'. Kharoba is a widely adapted, high-yielding, short, erect cultivar having good end-use qualities. Kharoba is resistant to leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.), yellow rust (caused by P. striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici), the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)], and Fusarium head blight (caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [teleomorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein.) Petch]). Kharoba has been released for cultivation under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Kharoba is the first bread wheat cultivar developed through doubled haploid breeding in Morocco.

AB Resistance (R) genes protect plants very effectively from disease, but many of them are rapidly overcome when present in widely grown cultivars. To overcome this lack of durability, strategies that increase host resistance diversity have been proposed. Among them is the use of multilines composed of near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing different disease resistance genes. In contrast to classical R-gene introgression by recurrent backcrossing, a transgenic approach allows the development of lines with identical genetic background, differing only in a single R gene. We have used alleles of the resistance locus Pm3 in wheat, conferring race-specific resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici), to develop transgenic wheat lines overexpressing Pm3a, Pm3c, Pm3d, Pm3f or Pm3g. In field experiments, all tested transgenic lines were significantly more resistant than their respective nontransformed sister lines. The resistance level of the transgenic Pm3 lines was determined mainly by the frequency of virulence to the particular Pm3 allele in the powdery mildew population, Pm3 expression levels and most likely also allele-specific properties. We created six two-way multilines by mixing seeds of the parental line Bobwhite and transgenic Pm3a, Pm3b and Pm3d lines. The Pm3 multilines were more resistant than their components when tested in the field. This demonstrates that the difference in a single R gene is sufficient to cause host-diversity effects and that multilines of transgenic Pm3 wheat lines represent a promising strategy for an effective and sustainable use of Pm3 alleles.

AB The southern root-knot nematode (RKN, Meloidogyne incognita) is a major soil-inhabiting plant parasite that causes significant yield losses in cotton (Gossypium spp.). Progeny from crosses between cotton genotypes susceptible to RKN produced segregants in subsequent populations which were highly resistant to this parasite. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 138 lines developed from a cross between Upland cotton TM-1 (G. hirsutum L.) and Pima 3-79 (G. barbadense L.), both susceptible to RKN, was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) determining responses to RKN in greenhouse infection assays with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Compared to both parents, 53.6% and 52.1% of RILs showed less (P<0.05) root-galling index (GI) and had lower (P<0.05) nematode egg production (eggs per gram root, EGR). Highly resistant lines (transgressive segregants) were identified in this RIL population for GI and/or EGR in two greenhouse experiments. QTLs were identified using the single-marker analysis nonparametric mapping Kruskal-Wallis test. Four major QTLs located on chromosomes 3, 4, 11, and 17 were identified to account for 8.0 to 12.3% of the phenotypic variance (R-2) in root-galling. Two major QTLs accounting for 9.7% and 10.6% of EGR variance were identified on chromosomes 14 and 23 (P<0.005), respectively. In addition, 19 putative QTLs (P<0.05) accounted for 4.5-7.7% of phenotypic variance (R-2) in GI, and 15 QTLs accounted for 4.2-7.3% of phenotypic variance in EGR. In lines with alleles positive for resistance contributed by both parents in combinations of two to four QTLs, dramatic reductions of >50% in both GI and EGR were observed. The transgressive segregants with epistatic effects derived from susceptible parents indicate that high levels of nematode resistance in cotton may be attained by pyramiding positive alleles using a QTL mapping approach.

AB Available information on genetically assigned molecular markers is not sufficient for efficient construction of a high-density linkage map in wheat. Here, we report on application of high resolution melting (HRM) analysis using a real-time PCR apparatus to develop single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to a hybrid necrosis gene, Net2, located on wheat chromosome 2D. Based on genomic information on barley chromosome 2H and wheat expressed sequence tag libraries, we selected wheat cDNA sequences presumed to be located near the Net2 chromosomal region, and then found SNPs between the parental Ae. tauschii accessions of the synthetic wheat mapping population. HRM analysis of the PCR products from F2 individuals' DNA enabled us to assign 44.4% of the SNP-representing cDNAs to chromosome 2D despite the presence of the A and B genomes. In addition, the designed SNP markers were assigned to chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii. The order of the assigned SNP markers in synthetic hexaploid wheat was confirmed by comparison with the markers in barley and Ae. tauschii. Thus, the SNP-genotyping method based on HRM analysis is a useful tool for development of molecular markers at target loci in wheat.

AB Jute is an important natural fibre crop, which is only second to cotton in its importance at the global level. It is mostly grown in Indian subcontinent and has been recently used for the development of genomics resources. We recently initiated a programme to develop simple sequence repeat markers and reported a set of 2469 SSR that were developed using four SSR-enriched libraries (Mir et al. 2009). In this communication, we report an additional set of 607 novel SSR in 393 SSR containing sequences. However, primers could be designed for only 417 potentially useful SSR. Polymorphism survey was carried out for 374 primer pairs using two parental genotypes (JRO 524 and PPO4) of a mapping population developed for fibre fineness; only 66 SSR were polymorphic. Owing to a low level of polymorphism between the parental genotypes and a high degree of segregation distortion in recombinant inbred lines, genotypic data of only 53 polymorphic SSR on the mapping population consisting of 120 RIL could be used for the construction of a linkage map; 36 SSR loci were mapped on six linkage groups that covered a total genetic distance of 784.3 cM. Hopefully, this map will be enriched with more SSR loci in future and will prove useful for identification of quantitative trait loci/genes for molecular breeding involving improvement of fibre fineness and other related traits in jute.

AB In a search for specific molecular markers for population analysis of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (IGS) 1 region (rDNA IGS1, between the 28S and the 5S rDNA genes) was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. It was found to exhibit multiple bands and length polymorphism. Surprisingly, single isolates were found to possess between three to five different IGS1 haplotypes. Bands were cloned and sequenced, and two highly variable regions (Cl and 13) were found between conserved regions, with repeat units interspersed in both types of regions. There were 14 different repeat units, and these were sometimes grouped further into four combinations of repeat units, with a few individual nucleotides (A or C) inserted between the repeats. Among three geographically dispersed isolates, the variable region alpha was divided into eight types, and the variable region beta was divided into two types based on repeat units. Most of the 14 repeat units were shared by the variable and the conserved regions. Among the three isolates, there were a total of 12 IGS1 haplotypes, but some of these were shared between isolates such that there were only eight unique haplotypes. The occurrence of multiple haplotypes within single isolates may be useful for analyzing the population structure, tracking the origin of annual epidemics and providing insights into evolutionary biology of this pathogen.

AB Abiotic stress is one of the major limiting factors reducing crop yield worldwide. We studied the expression profiles of 12 known stress responsive genes including transcription factor genes in japonica standard rice cultivar Nipponbare under low temperature, drought, NaCl and ABA stresses by RT-PCR in a time series up to 24 h. Expression of all the selected candidate genes was induced at least under one abiotic stress. The observed levels of expression of the same genes differed under different stress conditions; some were positively regulated under some stresses but negatively regulated under other stresses. Our results showed the presence of both specific and common gene regulatory pathways for these stresses and provide information on selective markers useful in evaluating cereal germplasms.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) and deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin produced by Fusarium graminearum reduce barley yield and quality worldwide. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using an antibody specific to Fusarium was proposed as an alternative for measuring FHB instead of counting infected kernels per spike. Cleistogamy (closed flowering) may be an avoidance mechanism for FHB resistance. This study was conducted to determine whether quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Fusarium ELISA were colocated with QTL for FHB, DON, heading date, height and spike density and/or the gene for cleistogamy. Doubled haploid lines from Zhedar 2/ND9712//Foster were tested in ten environments and used to develop a 260-marker linkage map. QTL analysis located 24 significant regions for the six traits. The effect of cleistogamy on resistance was unclear and environment specific. Of the two QTL located for ELISA, only one corresponded with a QTL for FHB, but large allelic differences in ELISA were found for the regions significantly associated with FHB and DON, indicating that ELISA could be a simpler method to identify lines with FHB resistance and low DON.

AB A leaf rust resistance gene (temporarily designated LrARK0;) was identified in the Swiss spelt wheat Altgold Rotkorn and mapped to chromosome 2A. The gene was located 2 cM distal to marker Xgwm614 (co-segregating with markers Xbarc124, Xbarc212, XE34M48-103 and XE38M53-334) on chromosome 2AS. This map location is similar to that of LrAlt identified in the same germplasm in a previous study. Based on gene location, allelism tests and pathogen specificity, this leaf rust resistance gene was designated Lr65. A single gene stock (AUS 91455) in a Triticum aestivum background was developed and registered for utilization and research purposes. The gene was widely effective against Australian and German isolates of Puccinia triticina.

AB A sample of 140 Fusarium graminearum isolates from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, representing three populations at least 150 km from one another, were examined for trichothecene genotype based on PCR amplification of portions of the Tri3 and Tri12 genes and a species-specific (Fg16F/R) primer pair. Genetic diversity was assessed in a sample of 103 F.similar to graminearum lineage 7 (F.similar to graminearum sensu stricto) isolates using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The 15-ADON genotype was dominant, followed by the NIV genotype (218% prevalence), across all three populations. All NIV-type isolates were in lineage 2 (F.similar to meridionale) and all 15-ADON-type isolates were in lineage 7. Isolates with the same haplotype were rare and genotypic diversity was uniformly high (=98% of the count), suggesting that recombination has played a significant role. The number of migrants (Nm) was estimated between 5 and 6 across all loci and all populations, but the high frequency of private alleles (up to 30%) suggests a historical, rather than contemporary, gene flow. Regarding linkage disequilibrium, 0.8, 1.5 and 2.2% of the locus pairs from the three populations were in disequilibrium, which is lower than values reported in other locations. Thus, Brazilian populations differ from those found in Europe, North America and most of Asia in the presence of a significant frequency (7.8%) of isolates of the NIV genotype in lineage 2.

AB An isolate of Puccinia coronata f.sp. avenae with virulence against the oat crown rust resistance gene Pc94 was discovered in oat fields in Cordoba, Spain. In order to identify alternative sources of resistance to this virulent isolate, a collection of 159 Avena accessions, including 107 A.similar to sativa and 29 A.similar to byzantina landraces and 23 commercial A.similar to sativa and A.similar to strigosa cultivars, was screened. Eight resistant landraces and four cultivars were selected according to macroscopic assessment to further characterize the operative defence mechanisms. Histological studies showed a range of defence mechanisms, acting alone or in combination, which impeded fungal development at different stages. Some accessions allowed reduced fungal growth before mesophyll penetration. In others, the fungus was arrested at the penetration stage by mesophyll cell wall strengthening and/or papilla deposition. Mesophyll cells of several accessions were penetrated by the fungus, but then the hypersensitive response (HR) leading to cell death hampered fungal development. In some cases cell death was very fast and colonies aborted early, whereas in other cases necrosis was observed later and associated with numerous secondary hyphae, suggesting a slow HR. Characterization of defence mechanisms will be useful for breeding programmes and for further cellular and molecular studies to unravel the bases of resistance. Commonalities with the resistance of the same oat collection to powdery mildew are discussed.

AB Eucalyptus globulus is the most commonly planted hardwood species for pulpwood in temperate regions. We aimed to develop and characterize functional molecular markers for population genetic analyses and molecular breeding in this model tree species. Public expressed sequence tag (EST) databases were screened for nonredundant sequences to predict putative gene functions and to discover simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs), which were then validated in E. globulus and six other Eucalyptus species. A total of 4,924 nonredundant sequences were identified from 12,690 updated E. globulus ESTs. Approximately 19.3% (952) were unigenes and contained 1,140 EST-SSR markers, which were mainly trimeric (58.6%). A set of 979 primers for putative SSR markers was designed after bioinformatic analysis. The predicted functions of these ESTs containing SSR were classified according to their gene ontology (GO) categories (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component). GO categories were assigned to 226 ESTs (30.2%). Most ESTs containing SSR (78.7%) had significant matches (E a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 10(-5)) with the nonredundant protein database using BLASTX. From a set of 56 random primer pairs, 37 could be validated in eight E. globulus genotypes and were also tested for cross-transferability to other six Eucalyptus species (Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus saligna, Eucalyptus dunnii, Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus tereticornis). Seventeen polymorphic EST-SSR markers for E. globulus were evaluated in 60 unrelated trees, being representative of the species' natural distribution. As a result, six highly informative markers were proposed for genetic diversity analyses, fingerprinting, and comparative population studies, between different species of E. globulus.

AB The wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer, is a polyphagous eriophyoid mite and the primary vector of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and five other viral pathogens in cereals. Previous research using molecular markers and a series of laboratory experiments found A. tosichella in Australia to consist of two genetically distinct lineages, which have broad overlapping distributions and differ in their ability to transmit WSMV under controlled conditions. This pattern of transmission also appears to be apparent in the field, whereby a strong association between WSMV detection and a single WCM lineage has been detected. In this study, we conduct a population genetic analysis and provide information on the genetic structure of the Australian viruliferous WCM lineage. We assessed genetic differentiation of 16 WCM populations using nine microsatellite markers. Strong evidence for extensive gene flow and low genetic structuring throughout the Australian wheatbelt was evident, with an exception for Western Australian and far north Queensland populations that appear to be genetically isolated. The data also indicate genetic patterns consistent with an arrhenotokous parthenogenetic mode of reproduction. Implications of these findings are discussed with reference to the management of WCM and associated cereal pathogens in Australia and overseas.

AB Cymbidium spp. are popular flowering plants. Assessment of the genetic diversity in cultivated Cymbidium facilitates conservation of germplasm and subsequent cultivar improvement. Thus, it is important to develop more efficient polymorphic DNA markers. Although more motifs (403) were identified and more primers (206) were designed in the genomic library compared to the cDNA library, a larger number of successful primers were obtained from the cDNA library (59.9%) than from genomic DNA library (51.1%). However, higher PIC and gene diversity were identified in genomic SSRs. The average allele number per locus was also higher in genomic SSRs (7.3) than EST-SSRs (5.2), among the 24 evaluated Cymbidium accessions. AT/TA was comparatively high in EST-SSRs, while this motif was not as common in genomic SSRs. The CTT/AAG/TCT/AGA/TTC/GAA and TGC/GCA/GCT/AGC/CTG/CAG motifs were the most abundant tri-nucleotide sequences in EST-SSRs, while GTT/AAC/TGT/ACA/TTG/CAA was the most frequent in genomic SSRs. The number of repeats ranged from 3 to 12 in EST-SSRs. Currently, 52 novel polymorphic SSR markers have been evaluated, which will be useful for germplasm assessments, core set construction, evaluation of genetic diversity, and marker assisted selection (MAS) based Cymbidium breeding.

AB The tropical maize race Tuxpeno is a well-known race of Mexican dent germplasm which has greatly contributed to the development of tropical and subtropical maize gene pools. In order to investigate how it could be exploited in future maize improvement, a panel of maize germplasm accessions was assembled and characterized using genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. This panel included 321 core accessions of Tuxpeno race from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) germplasm bank collection, 94 CIMMYT maize lines (CMLs) and 54 U.S. Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) lines. The panel also included other diverse sources of reference germplasm: 14 U.S. maize landrace accessions, 4 temperate inbred lines from the U. S. and China, and 11 CIMMYT populations (a total of 498 entries with 795 plants). Clustering analyses (CA) based on Modified Rogers Distance (MRD) clearly partitioned all 498 entries into their corresponding groups. No sub clusters were observed within the Tuxpeno core set. Various breeding strategies for using the Tuxpeno core set, based on grouping of the studied germplasm and genetic distance among them, were discussed. In order to facilitate sampling diversity within the Tuxpeno core, a minicore subset of 64 Tuxpeno accessions (20% of its usual size) representing the diversity of the core set was developed, using an approach combining phenotypic and molecular data. Untapped diversity represents further use of the Tuxpeno landrace for maize improvement through the core and/or minicore subset available to the maize community.

AB Bacterial leaf streak (BLS), caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (Smith et al.) Bragard et al., and spot blotch (SB), caused by Cochliobolus sativus (S. Ito & Kurib.) Drechs. ex Dastur, are two emerging diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To achieve sustainable disease management strategies and reduce yield losses, identifying new genes that confer quantitative resistance would benefit resistance breeding efforts. The main objective of this study was to use association mapping (AM) with 832 polymorphic Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers to identify genomic regions associated with resistance to BLS and SB in 566 spring wheat landraces. From data analysis of this diverse panel of wheat accessions, we discovered five novel genomic regions significantly associated with resistance to BLS on chromosomes 1A, 4A, 4B, 6B, and 7D. Similarly, four genomic regions were found to be associated with resistance to SB on chromosomes 1A, 3B, 7B, and 7D. A high degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed over short genetic distance in the set of wheat accessions studied, and some of these genomic regions appear to be involved in multiple disease resistance (MDR). These results suggest that the AM approach provides a platform for discovery of resistance conditioned by multiple genes with quantitative effects, which could be validated and deployed in wheat breeding programs.

AB Genic microsatellites, are currently among the best DNA markers because they often represent transcribed genes with putative function, and their cost is relatively low. In this study, 7,529 non-redundant (nr) ESTs from gerbera, obtained from public databases, were identified and characterized to validate their use as genic microsatellite markers. Of the assembled nr ESTs, 1,244 contained SSRs, and trinucleotides (GAA) were found to be the most abundant repeats at 42.3%, followed by dinucleotides (GA) at 25.3% and tetranucleotides (TTTG) at 6.2%. Gene ontology (GO) characterization was used to perform functional annotation of unigenes containing SSRs, of which 36.87% revealed significant sequence similarities with other species, indicating the top species with the highest similarity. A total of 647 primer pairs may be designed from the nr SSR-positive ESTs (excluding those with only mononucleotide repeats) for amplification of potential genic markers. A sample of 50 primer pairs was tested, and 17 were validated. The identified markers were highly polymorphic and able to differentiate 34 genotypes, representing the genetic variation within commercial and wild varieties. This study provides insight as to the frequency and distribution of SSRs in the gerbera transcriptome and demonstrates the successful development of genic SSRs. We expect that the potential markers described here can greatly expand the repertoire of DNA markers available for both breeding and genetic studies in Gerbera spp.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions for resistance to FHB and estimate their effects on reducing FHB damage to wheat in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We examined 233 F-1-derived doubled-haploid (DH) lines from a cross between 'Kukeiharu 14' and 'Sumai 3' to determine their reaction to FHB during two seasons under field conditions. The DH lines were genotyped at five known FHB-resistance QTL regions (on chromosomes 3BS, 5AS, 6BS, 2DL and 4BS) by using SSR markers. 'Sumai 3' alleles at the QTLs at 3BS and 5AS effectively reduced FHB damage in the environment of Hokkaido, indicating that these QTLs will be useful for breeding spring wheat cultivars suitable for Hokkaido. Some of the QTL regions influenced agronomic traits: 'Sumai 3' alleles at the 4BS and 5AS QTLs significantly increased stem length and spike length, that at the 2DL QTL significantly decreased grain weight, and that at the 6BS QTL significantly delayed heading, indicating pleiotropic or linkage effects between these agronomic traits and FHB resistance.

AB The tolerance of the dune grass Leymus molls (Triticeae; Poaceae) to various biotic and abiotic stresses makes it a very useful genetic resource for wheat breeding. Wide hybridization between L. mollis and wheat allows the introduction of Leymus chromosomes into the wheat genetic background and facilitates the integration of useful traits into wheat. However, the genetic basis controlling the physiological tolerance of L. molls to multiple environmental stresses remains largely unexplored. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we identified 112 osmotic-stress-responsive genes from L. mills and confirmed their differential expression under osmotic stress. These genes were categorized into 13 functional categories, including cell defense and stress response, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, biosynthesis of compatible solutes and cell wall metabolism. Representative genes were validated by northern blot and RT-PCR analyses of expression patterns in response to osmotic stress and abscisic acid treatment. The genes identified here represent a useful source of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for the analysis and identification of Leymus chromosomes introduced into wheat. Furthermore, being highly conserved, genetically associated with osmotic stress tolerance and transferable to wheat, these ESTs provide significant tools for the development of EST-derived molecular markers for introgression of osmotic stress tolerance genes into wheat.

AB Bipolaris sorokiniana, the causal agent of spot blotch of wheat, significantly reduces grain yield worldwide. In order to study pathogenic mechanisms of the fungus, conditions for efficient transformation using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were investigated. To study different stages of hyphal fusion and pathogenic mechanisms of the fungus, two fluorescence markers viz, the red fluorescent protein (DsRed-Express) and the green fluorescent protein (EGFP1) were constitutively expressed. Southern hybridizations confirmed the presence of T-DNA in all hygromycin B or geneticin resistant transformants, and also showed random and single copy integration. Fluorescence microscopy suggested the high level expression of both DsRed and EGFP fluorescent proteins in spores and mycelia. The results signify that DsRed and EGFP can be used as efficient reporter gene for monitoring B. sorokiniana hyphal fusion as well as colonization in the host tissues. This work will be useful to develop methodologies for understanding the mechanisms of Bipolaris-wheat interaction and functional genomics of B. sorokiniana for various applications including insertional mutagenesis, targeted disruption of specific genes, ectopic complementation of loss-of-function strains and over-expression.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops globally and a high priority for genetic improvement, but its large and complex genome has been seen as intractable to whole genome sequencing. Isolation of individual wheat chromosome arms has facilitated large-scale sequence analyses. However, so far there is no such survey of sequences from the A genome of wheat. Greater understanding of an A chromosome could facilitate wheat improvement and future sequencing of the entire genome. We have constructed BAC library from the long arm of T. aestivum chromosome 1A (1AL) and obtained BAC end sequences from 7,470 clones encompassing the arm. We obtained 13,445 (89.99%) useful sequences with a cumulative length of 7.57 Mb, representing 1.43% of 1AL and about 0.14% of the entire A genome. The GC content of the sequences was 44.7%, and 90% of the chromosome was estimated to comprise repeat sequences, while just over 1% encoded expressed genes. From the sequence data, we identified a large number of sites suitable for development of molecular markers (362 SSR and 6,948 ISBP) which will have utility for mapping this chromosome and for marker assisted breeding. From 44 putative ISBP markers tested 23 (52.3%) were found to be useful. The BAC end sequence data also enabled the identification of genes and syntenic blocks specific to chromosome 1AL, suggesting regions of particular functional interest and targets for future research.

AB Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), is a significant insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and has had a major economic impact worldwide, especially on winter wheat in the western United States. Development of resistant cultivars remains the most viable method for RWA control, although the continuing emergence of new RWA biotypes virulent to deployed resistance genes reinforces the need for the discovery of new sources of resistance. Iranian wheat landrace accession PI 626580 has shown high levels of resistance to RWA biotypes 1 (RWA1) and 2 (RWA2), but the inheritance and chromosomal location of this resistance is unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine the inheritance of RWA2 resistance, identify closely linked markers, and map the chromosomal location of RWA2 resistance found in PI 626580. Bulked segregant analysis was conducted with a mapping population of 154 F-2 individuals derived from a single plant selection made from PI 626580 and 'Yuma' (a susceptible wheat cultivar). Phenotypic segregation of RWA2 resistance suggested a single dominant gene, provisionally designated Dn626580. Linkage mapping analysis identified three simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, Xbarc214, Xgwm473, and Xgwm437, proximally linked to Dn626580 near the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 7D at distances of 1.8, 5.0, and 8.2 cM, respectively. Dn626580, a new resistance gene found in PI 626580, could be used alone or by pyramiding with other resistance genes to develop cultivars with effective RWA resistance.

AB A recently identified Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) resistance gene Wsm2 confers a high level of resistance. Objective of this study was to identify closely linked DNA markers for Wsm2 for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two segregating populations (CO960293-2 x 'TAM 111' and CO960293-2 x 'Yuma') of F-2:3 families were evaluated for response to WSMV infection in growth chamber experiments. Forty-eight simple sequence repeat (SSR) or sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were screened for polymorphism between the parents of both populations. In the CO960293-2 x TAM 111 population, five markers were mapped to the region of Wsm2 with XSTS3B-55 being the closest marker (5.2 cM distal to Wsm2). In the CO960293-2 x Yuma population, eight markers were linked to Wsm2 with the closest marker Xbarc102 linked at 3.9 cM proximal to Wsm2. Results from consensus mapping of the two populations suggested that Xbarc102 was distal to Wsm2. The marker Xbarc102 was associated with Wsm2 in all 22 wheat lines derived from crosses between susceptible parents and either CO960293-2 or 'RonL' (also carrying Wsm2). The marker allele Xbarc102-219-bp present in CO960293-2 was amplified in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from Wsm2-carrying genotypes CO960293-w133, RonL, and 'Snowmass' but not from the resistant line KS96HW10-3 (carrying Wsm1) or the susceptible genotypes 'Karl 92', 'TAM 107', and 'N96L9970'. Therefore, this marker should be useful for MAS of Wsm2 in breeding programs.

AB Novel dwarfing germplasms and dwarfing genes are valuable for the wheat breeding. A novel semi-dwarf line, 31505-1, with reduced height compared with its common wheat parent, was derived from a cross between common wheat and Thinopyrum ponticum. Cytological studies demonstrated that 31505-1 contained 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis showed that 31505-1 had no large Th. ponticum chromosome fragments. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results revealed the absence of a pAs1 hybridization band on 2DL chromosome of 31505-1. Two SSR markers (Xwmc41 and Xcfd168) and two STS markers (Xmag4059 and Xmag3596), which were located on 2D chromosome, amplified unique bands of Th. Ponticum in 31505-1. These revealed presence of an introgressed Th. ponticum segment in 2DL chromosome of dwarf line 31505-1, although the alien segment could not be detected by GISH.

AB Variation at the Xgwm261 locus was studied in 92 Indian bread wheat varieties. The locus is of interest because its 192 bp allele is reported to be linked to semi-dwarfing gene Rht8. There were five allelic variants based on size. Occurrence of 165, 192 and 174 bp alleles was 44.5, 39.1 and 10.8%, respectively. Sequencing showed six new alleles. Cvs. C306 and PBW516 showed 192 bp alleles which were different from each other, different from other varieties and also from reported sequence. A 200 bp band in four varieties was unique and different in CT repeats and sequence motif next to the repeat region. Cv. NI179 showed new 198 bp allele. The varieties were also analysed with allele specific primers for Norin10 genes. Among semi-dwarf varieties, frequencies of RhtB1b and RhtD1b were 48.5 and 45.7%, respectively. The relation between alleles of Xgwm261 and agronomic traits was studied by growing plants at two locations. The 192 bp allele did not show association with grain yield or its components at Trombay location. Differences in plant height among the 192, 165 and 174 bp allele carriers were not significant at both the locations indicating that the 192 bp allele in Indian varieties was neutral with respect to plant height. Frequency of 165 bp allele was higher in varieties recommended for warmer zones and late sown conditions.

AB We conducted a molecular analysis of the Vrn-B1 gene in two near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying the dominant Vrn-B1 (S) and Vrn-B1 (Dm) alleles from the Saratovskaya 29 and Diamant 2 cultivars, respectively. These lines are characterized by different times of ear emergence. PCR analysis and subsequent sequencing of the regulatory regions of Vrn-B1 revealed the full identity of the promoter region in both alleles. Simultaneously, we found significant differences in the structure of the first intron of the Vrn-B1 (S) allele when compared to Vrn-B1 (Dm) ; specifically, the deletion of 0.8 kb coupled with the duplication of 0.4 kb. We suggest that these changes in intron 1 of Vrn-B1 (S) caused earlier ear emergence in the corresponding NIL. The unusual structure of intron 1 within the Vrn-B1 (S) allele was described for the first time in this study. The allele Vrn-B1 (Dm) was almost identical with the previously studied sequence of the Vrn-B1a allele of T. aestivum, Triple Dirk B. We designated the new Vrn-B1 (S) allele as Vrn-B1c. PCR analysis of the Vrn-B1 gene in 26 spring wheat cultivars of both Russian and foreign breeding revealed that 16 of them contain the Vrn-B1a allele and 6 contain the Vrn-B1c allele. Other cultivars studied contained the recessive vrn-B1 gene, except for Novosibirskaya 67. This study demonstrates that the traditional system of Vrn-1 markers does not fully encompass the allelic diversity of these genes because none of the cultivars containing the Vrn-B1c allele gave a PCR product using the previously developed set of primers for identification of the Vrn-B1 locus. We showed that the newly characterized Vrn-B1c allele is widely distributed among different genotypes of spring wheat. The findings indicate the impact of structural changes in the first intron of Vrn-1 on the vernalization response and heading time.

AB High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) is a durable type of resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This study identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring HTAP resistance to stripe rust in a population consisting of 169 F-8:10 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between a susceptible cultivar Rio Blanco and a resistant germplasm IDO444. HTAP resistance was evaluated for both disease severity and infection type under natural infection over two years at two locations. The genetic linkage maps had an average density of 6.7 cM per marker across the genome and were constructed using 484 markers including 96 wheat microsatellite (SSR), 632 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) polymorphisms, two sequence-tagged-site (STS) from semi-dwarf genes Rht1 and Rht2, and two markers for low molecular-weight glutenin gene subunits. QTL analysis detected a total of eight QTL significantly associated with HTAP resistance to stripe rust with two on chromosome 2B, two on 3B and one on each of 1A, 4A, 4B and 5B. QTL on chromosomes 2B and 4A were the major loci derived from IDO444 and explained up to 47 and 42% of the phenotypic variation for disease severity and infection type, respectively. The remaining five QTL accounted for 7-10% of the trait variation. Of these minor QTL, the resistant alleles at the two QTL QYrrb.ui-3B.1 and QYrrb.ui-4B derived from Rio Blanco and reduced infection type only, while the resistant alleles at the other three QTL, QYrid.ui-1A, QYrid.ui-3B.2 and QYrid.ui-5B, all derived from IDO444 and reduced either infection type or disease severity. Markers linked to 2B and 4A QTL should be useful for selection of HTAP resistance to stripe rust.

AB Breeding for resistance to Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph: Septoria tritici), is an essential component in controlling this important foliar disease of wheat. Inheritance of seedling resistance to seven worldwide pathogen isolates has been studied in a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between the field resistant cultivar Solitar and the susceptible cultivar Mazurka. Multiple quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping revealed major and minor genetic effects on resistance as well as several epistatic relationships in the seedling stage. Solitar conferred resistance to isolate IPO323, governed by Stb6 on chromosome 3A, as well as to IPO99015, IPO92034, Hu1 and Hu2 controlled by a QTL on chromosome arm 1BS, possibly corresponding to Stb11 and minor QTL on chromosomes 1B, 3D, 6B and 7D. Resistance of Mazurka to IPO90015 and BBA22 was caused by a QTL located in a region on 4AL which harbours Stb7 or Stb12. QTL specific to pycnidial coverage on 3B and specific to necrosis on 1A could be discovered for isolate IPO92034. Pairwise epistatic interactions were reliably detected with five isolates. Although their contributions to the total variance are generally low, the genotypic effect of the QTL by QTL interaction of 4AL (Stb7 or Stb12) and 3AS (Stb6) made up almost 15% of disease expression. Altogether, the results suggest a complex inheritance of resistance to STB in the seedling stage in terms of isolate-specificity and resistance mechanisms, which have implications for marker-assisted breeding in an attempt to pyramid STB resistance genes.

AB Chawali and Lekali are two common farmer's barley varieties or landraces in Jumla, Nepal (2,240-3,000 m) with small to bold grains and wide adaptation from irrigated low lands to high hills. This study was undertaken to test whether features of the traditional seed system can significantly influence the diversity of a crop and its conservation on-farm. In Jumla (high-hill), the barley seed system is completely informal and is mainly from farmer to farmer. In the present study, the seed flows and the pattern of genetic diversity in barley were investigated to detect differences between the two varieties and test the divergence among populations of each variety These data suggested that Chawali, the more common variety, was less subject to homogenising gene flow between farms than was Lekali. A total of 128 farming households were surveyed for seed supply information and 128 populations for each landrace from two villages: Kartikswami and Talium were collected for SSR diversity analysis. Some 92 SSRs were screened in an initial sample of 20 barley populations of both landraces and 2 improved varieties (LG-51 and Soluwa). Of the 81 SSRs that consistently amplified, only 15 SSRs (19%) were polymorphic with gene diversity values ranging from 0.09 to 0.71. A medium to low diversity was detected among the landrace populations of barley varieties. Chawali populations were less polymorphic within ecological groups, and more divergent between than were Lekail populations. This result accords with Chawali having a more conservative local seed system.

AB In southern Australia, where the climate is predominantly Mediterranean, achieving the correct flowering time in bread wheat minimizes the impact of in-season cyclical and terminal drought. Flag leaf glaucousness has been hypothesized as an important component of drought tolerance but its value and genetic basis in locally adapted germplasm is unknown. From a cross between Kukri and RAC875, a doubled-haploid (DH) population was developed. A genetic linkage map consisting of 456 DArT and SSR markers was used to detect QTL affecting time to ear emergence and Zadoks growth score in seven field experiments. While ear emergence time was similar between the parents, there was significant transgressive segregation in the population. This was the result of segregation for the previously characterized Ppd-D1a and Ppd-B1 photoperiod responsive alleles. QTL of smaller effect were also detected on chromosomes 1A, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 7A and 7B. A novel QTL for flag leaf glaucousness of large, repeatable effect was detected in six field experiments, on chromosome 3A (QW.aww-3A) and accounted for up to 52 percent of genetic variance for this trait. QW.aww-3A was validated under glasshouse conditions in a recombinant inbred line population from the same cross. The genetic basis of time to ear emergence in this population will aid breeders' understanding of phenological adaptation to the local environment. Novel loci identified for flag leaf glaucousness and the wide phenotypic variation within the DH population offers considerable scope to investigate the impact and value of this trait for bread wheat production in southern Australia.

AB Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled whole genome re-sequencing in many species providing unprecedented discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. There are limitations, however, to next-generation sequencing approaches for species with large complex genomes such as barley and wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has been developed as a tool for association studies and genomics-assisted breeding in a range of species including those with complex genomes. GBS uses restriction enzymes for targeted complexity reduction followed by multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low per sample cost. Here we present a GBS approach for species that currently lack a reference genome sequence. We developed a novel two-enzyme GBS protocol and genotyped bi-parental barley and wheat populations to develop a genetically anchored reference map of identified SNPs and tags. We were able to map over 34,000 SNPs and 240,000 tags onto the Oregon Wolfe Barley reference map, and 20,000 SNPs and 367,000 tags on the Synthetic W9784xOpata85 (SynOpDH) wheat reference map. To further evaluate GBS in wheat, we also constructed a de novo genetic map using only SNP markers from the GBS data. The GBS approach presented here provides a powerful method of developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing valuable tools for anchoring and ordering physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequence. Development of the sequenced reference genome(s) will in turn increase the utility of GBS data enabling physical mapping of genes and haplotype imputation of missing data. Finally, as a result of low per-sample costs, GBS will have broad application in genomics-assisted plant breeding programs.

AB Reductions in plant height are associated with genotypic increases in lodging resistance, harvest index and wheat yields worldwide. Historically, the largest single increase in harvest index and yield was seen in development of semi-dwarf wheats through introgression of the gibberellic acid (GA)-insensitive, Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfing alleles. A suite of GA-sensitive dwarfing genes including Rht8 are also available and their neutral effects on seedling vigour suggest their potential in being deployed singly, or in combination with GA-insensitive dwarfing alleles. Five biparental and backcross populations each comprising between 44 and 124 progeny were developed from commercial parents varying for alleles at either the Rht-B1 or Rht-D1 and the Rht8 dwarfing gene loci. Progeny was grown together in multiple environments, and assessed for agronomic performance and coleoptile growth. Genotypic variation was large and significant (P < 0.05) for plant height, grain yield and its components, harvest index, grain number and size. Reduction in plant height for lines containing Rht8c and either Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b dwarfing alleles averaged 8 and 17%, respectively. The Rht8c + Rht-B1b/D1b sesqui-dwarfs were significantly (P < 0.05) shorter (-24%) and commonly higher-yielding (+6 to 10%) than lines containing either dwarfing gene alone. Their higher yields reflected similar biomass but a greater harvest index (+7 to 11%) and reduced lodging (-19 to -32%) compared to single dwarfs. The Rht8c dwarfing allele did not appear epistatic with either Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b alleles in effects on plant growth. Coleoptile lengths were similar for sesqui- anti Rht-B1b/D1b single-dwarfs and both shorter than for Rht8c and tall lines. Together with their pleiotropic effects on harvest index and availability of linked molecular markers, simultaneous selection of Rht8c + Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b sesqui-dwarfs in early generations may facilitate rapid development of high-yielding varieties targeting favourable and unfavourable environments alike.

AB Salinity is one of the most serious constraints to rice production worldwide. Rice is salt-sensitive and its growth and yield can drastically be reduced by salt stress. Salt-tolerant mutants are promising varieties for salt-affected soils and they constitute unique genetic stocks for gene discovery. Out of the 60,000 IR64 mutant lines generated at IRRI, 5000 mutants were screened for salt-stress tolerance at the seedling stage using hydroponics. Mutants that are either more tolerant or more sensitive than IR64 were identified and advanced through single seeds after phenotyping for salt tolerance at each generation. Furthermore, the genetic background of the selected mutants was confirmed using SSR markers. Tolerant mutants absorbed less Na+ and more K+, resulting in lower Na+:K+ ratio in their shoots, and produced more shoot biomass through faster growth that can further dilute the absorbed Na+. Contrastingly, the sensitive mutants had higher Na+ and Na+:K+ ratio and lower survival and produced less biomass under salt stress. Four tolerant and three sensitive mutants were selected and, together with tolerant and sensitive checks, were evaluated in a series of field trials under non-saline field conditions to compare their agronomic performance with that of IR64, and in saline fields to confirm their responses relative to IR64 and to assess the impacts of these mutations on growth and yield in salt-affected fields. When evaluated under control conditions in the field, the sensitive and tolerant mutants were similar to 11264 in the majority of growth and yield traits. However, in saline fields, the tolerant mutants had lower Standard Evaluation System (SES) scores and better survival and growth than either IR64 or the sensitive mutants. They also produced an average of 0.8-1.0 t ha(-1) higher yield than IR64 and 1.2-1.47 t ha(-1) than the sensitive lines. This yield enhancement was associated with more productive tillers and heavier panicles with more fertile spikelets in the tolerant mutants. IR64 was intermediate for most traits. These salt-tolerant mutants are potential varieties for salt-affected coastal areas provided that other quality traits of IR64 have not been significantly altered to ensure acceptance by farmers. Mapping and cloning of these mutations can help understand their genetic and physiological bases and identify new genes for use in breeding, which is currently being pursued. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB A large number of Fusarium isolates was collected from blighted wheat spikes originating from 175 sampling sites, covering 15 provinces in China. Species and trichothecene chemotype determination by multilocus genotyping (MLGT) indicated that F. graminearum s. str. with the 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol (15ADON) chemotype and F. asiaticum with either the nivalenol (NIV) or the 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON) chemotype were the dominant causal agents. Bayesian model-based clustering with allele data obtained with 12 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) markers, detected three genetic clusters that also show distinct chemotypes. High levels of population genetic differentiation and low levels of effective number of migrants were observed between these three clusters. Additional genotypic analyses revealed that F. graminearum s. str. and F. asiaticum are sympatric. In addition, composition analysis of these clusters indicated a biased gene flow from 3ADON to NIV producers in F. asiaticum. In phenotypic analyses, F. asiaticum that produce 3ADON revealed significant advantages over F. asiaticum that produce NIV in pathogenicity, growth rate, fecundity, conidial length, trichothecene accumulation and resistance to benzimidazole. These results suggest that natural selection drives the spread of a more vigorous, more toxigenic pathogen population which also shows higher levels of fungicide resistance.

AB Improved ability to establish well when sowing at depth, into crop residues or hard soils should lead to increased yields in these situations. The semi-dwarfing Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b genes reduce plant height and increase grain number and yield in favourable environments. However, these genes are associated with reduced coleoptile length and leaf length extension to slow leaf area and biomass accumulation especially when seed are sown deep. Preliminary evidence indicates the potential of Rht4, Rht5, Rht8, Rht12 and Rht13 gibberellin-responsive (GAR) dwarfing genes to reduce plant height without affecting seedling vigour. Four large, inbred populations were generated varying for presence of one or more GAR-dwarfing genes. Lines were genotyped with molecular markers linked to each dwarfing gene and grown in multiple environments to evaluate seedling growth and agronomic performance. Genotypic variation was large for plant height, aerial biomass, grain yield and its components, grain number and size. Height reduction was greatest for Rht5 (-55%), Rht12 (-45%), Rht13 (-34%), Rht4 (-17%), and to a lesser extent Rht8 (-7%). In comparison, height reductions associated with Rht-B1b averaged 23%. Reduced height was genetically correlated with reduced lodging score (r(g) = 0.84-0.93), increased dry-matter partitioning to grain (i.e. harvest index; r(g) = -0.46** to -0.86**) and increased grain number (r(g) = -0.22* to -0.73**). Most dwarfing genes were associated with increased grain number: Rht13 (+27%), Rht4 (+19%), Rht12 (+19%), and Rht-B1b (+9%). Rht8 had little effect on grain number (-1%) whereas later maturity associated with Rht5 contributed to reduced grain number (-66%). The influence of dwarfing genes on aerial biomass was negligible, with some Rht4, Rht12 and Rht13 semi-dwarf lines identified combining greater partitioning and aerial biomass to increase grain yield. Compared to tall siblings, coleoptile lengths and seedling leaf breadths were largely unaffected by GAR-dwarfing genes but leaf length was on average smaller in lines containing Rht5 or Rht12. These studies demonstrate the potential of GAR-dwarfing genes for increasing grain number and yield without compromising aerial biomass or coleoptile length in bread wheat.

AB Background: Crop production practices and industrialization processes result in increasing acidification of arable soils. At lower pH levels (below 5.0), aluminum (Al) remains in a cationic form that is toxic to plants, reducing growth and yield. The effect of aluminum on agronomic performance is particularly important in cereals like wheat, which has promoted the development of programs directed towards selection of tolerant forms. Even in intermediately tolerant cereals (i.e., triticale), the decrease in yield may be significant. In triticale, Al tolerance seems to be influenced by both wheat and rye genomes. However, little is known about the precise chromosomal location of tolerance-related genes, and whether wheat or rye genomes are crucial for the expression of that trait in the hybrid.
   Results: A mapping population consisting of 232 advanced breeding triticale forms was developed and phenotyped for Al tolerance using physiological tests. AFLP, SSR and DArT marker platforms were applied to obtain a sufficiently large set of molecular markers (over 3000). Associations between the markers and the trait were tested using General (GLM) and Multiple (MLM) Linear Models, as well as the Statistical Machine Learning (SML) approach. The chromosomal locations of candidate markers were verified based on known assignments of SSRs and DArTs or by using genetic maps of rye and triticale. Two candidate markers on chromosome 3R and 9, 15 and 11 on chromosomes 4R, 6R and 7R, respectively, were identified. The r(2) values were between 0.066 and 0.220 in most cases, indicating a good fit of the data, with better results obtained with the GML than the MLM approach. Several QTLs on rye chromosomes appeared to be involved in the phenotypic expression of the trait, suggesting that rye genome factors are predominantly responsible for Al tolerance in triticale.
   Conclusions: The Diversity Arrays Technology was applied successfully to association mapping studies performed on triticale breeding forms. Statistical approaches allowed the identification of numerous markers associated with Al tolerance. Available rye and triticale genetic maps suggested the putative location of the markers and demonstrated that they formed several linked groups assigned to distinct chromosomes (3R, 4R, 6R and 7R). Markers associated with genomic regions under positive selection were identified and indirectly mapped in the vicinity of the Al-tolerant markers. The present findings were in agreement with prior reports.

AB Background: The purpose of the study is to elucidate the sequence composition of the short arm of rye chromosome 1 (Secale cereale) with special focus on its gene content, because this portion of the rye genome is an integrated part of several hundreds of bread wheat varieties worldwide.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Multiple Displacement Amplification of 1RS DNA, obtained from flow sorted 1RS chromosomes, using 1RS ditelosomic wheat-rye addition line, and subsequent Roche 454FLX sequencing of this DNA yielded 195,313,589 bp sequence information. This quantity of sequence information resulted in 0.43 x sequence coverage of the 1RS chromosome arm, permitting the identification of genes with estimated probability of 95%. A detailed analysis revealed that more than 5% of the 1RS sequence consisted of gene space, identifying at least 3,121 gene loci representing 1,882 different gene functions. Repetitive elements comprised about 72% of the 1RS sequence, Gypsy/Sabrina (13.3%) being the most abundant. More than four thousand simple sequence repeat (SSR) sites mostly located in gene related sequence reads were identified for possible marker development. The existence of chloroplast insertions in 1RS has been verified by identifying chimeric chloroplast-genomic sequence reads. Synteny analysis of 1RS to the full genomes of Oryza sativa and Brachypodium distachyon revealed that about half of the genes of 1RS correspond to the distal end of the short arm of rice chromosome 5 and the proximal region of the long arm of Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 2. Comparison of the gene content of 1RS to 1HS barley chromosome arm revealed high conservation of genes related to chromosome 5 of rice.
   Conclusions: The present study revealed the gene content and potential gene functions on this chromosome arm and demonstrated numerous sequence elements like SSRs and gene-related sequences, which can be utilised for future research as well as in breeding of wheat and rye.

AB Italian millet is a commercially important grain crop. Nineteen polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, developed through construction of an SSR-enriched library from genomic DNA of Italian millet (Setaria italica L., P. Beauv.), were used for assessment of molecular genetic diversity against 40 accessions of S. italica. In total, 85 alleles were detected, with an average of 4.5 alleles per locus. The average gene diversity and polymorphism information content (PIC) values were 0.412 and 0.376, ranging from 0.02 to 0.88 and from 0.02 to 0.87, respectively. Values for observed (H-O) and expected (H-E) heterozygosities ranged from 0 to 0.73 and from 0.03 to 0.89, respectively. Nine loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The mean similarity coefficient among accessions was 0.6593. Based on the UPGMA algorithm, six different groups were successfully identified. In this clustering analysis, all Korean accessions grouped in one cluster, indicating that Korean accessions are genetically quite distinct from other introduced accessions. These newly developed microsatellite markers should be very useful tools for several genetic studies, including an assessment of diversity and population structure in Italian millet.

AB Thinopyrum elongatum serves as an excellent gene pool for wheat improvement. Genes for resistance to many biotic and abiotic stresses have been transferred from Th. elongatum to wheat through chromosome manipulation. For breeding programs, molecular markers enable screening of a large number of genotypes for alien chromosome introgressions. The main objective of the present study was to develop and characterize EST (expressed sequence tags) and PLUG (PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene) markers that can distinguish Th. elongatum chromatin from the wheat genomes. A total of 258 mapped EST primer pairs and 46 PLUG primer pairs were tested on DNA from wheat Chinese Spring (CS) and CS-Th. elongatum addition lines. The results showed that 43 primer pairs could be effectively mapped to specific Th. elongatum chromosomes. Twenty-two of the 43 markers displayed similar homoeologous chromosome locations to hexaploid wheat. Nine markers mapped to different linkage groups between wheat and Th. elongatum, while 12 makers mapped on two or three different Th. elongatum chromosomes. A comparison of molecular marker locations indicated that Th. elongatum genome was closely related to the D genome of wheat, and chromosome rearrangements and duplication had occurred in Th. elongatum and the wheat genomes. The markers will be useful in comparative gene mapping, chromosome evolutionary analysis, and gene introgression for wheat improvement using Th. elongatum accessions as gene donors.

Regenerated plants were derived from immature embryo culture of hybrids of common wheat varieties 'Zhengmai 9023', 'CB037' and 'Zhongmai 16' with the wheat-barley 2H alien substitution lines 2H(2A) and 2H(2B) after callus induction, subculture and differentiation. The presence of barley 2H chromatin was detected in regenerated plants (SC1) and their selfed progeny (SC2-5) using homoeologous group 2 SSR markers from barley and further identified in selected SC4 and SC5 lines using genomic in situ hybridization with barley genomic DNA as probe and CS genomic DNA for blocking. The Isa gene from the identified SC4 and SC5 lines was also amplified using Isa-specific primers. We identified wheat-barley 2H chromosome translocation lines carring the Isa gene.

AB Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are important resources for gene discovery and mapping. In this study, we developed EST-based SSR (eSSRs) markers and assessed their ability in mapping and transferability. A total of 10 800 unigenes were detected from 18 522 pea EST sequences (December 2009). Screening of 10 800 unigenes by MISA (MIcroSAtellite) revealed 2612 (14.1%) eSSRs in 2395 (12.9%) SSR-containing ESTs from which 577 (24.1%) primer pairs were designed. The most abundant repeat motif identified in eSSR was mononucleotide (85.2%), followed by trinucleotide (10.6%) and dinucleotide (2.8%). Among 108 randomly selected primer pairs, 40 were assessed for mapping and 68 to test cross-species transferability in six leguminous species. Out of 40 primer pairs, 85% produced amplicons, 60% showed polymorphism and 47.5% were mapped. Furthermore, 68 primer pairs revealed high rate of transferability (48-85%) in leguminous species. High levels of polymorphism, reproducibility, presence of alleles (3.8/locus) and transferability revealed the potential use of these eSSR markers in molecular mapping, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and comparative mapping in pea and other legumes.

AB Kernel hardness is one of the most important factors determining the milling and processing quality of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In the present study, 267 wheat cultivars and advanced lines from the Yellow and Huai Valley of China, CIMMYT, Russia and Ukraine were used for identification of SKCS (Single Kernel Characterization System) hardness and puroindoline alleles. Results indicated that Pinb-D1b is the most popular genotype in wheat cultivars from the Yellow and Huai Valley, Russia and Ukraine, whereas PINA null is a predominant genotype in wheat cultivars and advanced lines from CIMMYT. Molecular characterization of PINA-null alleles indicated that one Chinese landrace Chiyacao had the allele Pina-D1l with a single nucleotide C deletion at position 265 in Pina coding region based on sequencing results, and 35 of 39 PINA-null alleles belonged to Pina-D1b according to PCR amplification with the sequence-tagged site (STS) marker Pina-N developed previously. The remaining three cultivars (Jiangdongmen, Heshangtou and Hongquanmang from China) with PINA-null alleles were characterized at the DNA level by a primer walking strategy, and the results showed that all three cultivars with PINA-null alleles possessed a uniform 10,415-bp deletion from -5,117 bp to +5,298 bp (ATG codon references zero), designated as Pina-D1r. Correspondingly, an STS marker Pina-N2 with an expected fragment size of 436-bp spanning the 10,415-bp deletion was developed for detection of the Pina-D1r allele. This study provided a useful molecular marker for straightforward detection of one of the PINA-null alleles and would also be helpful to further understand the molecular and genetic basis of kernel hardness in bread wheat.

AB Pm21 is an effective gene for powdery mildew resistance transferred from Haynaldia villosa into common wheat cultivars. No virulence against this gene has been detected so far. A set of 42 powdery mildew isolates collected in Israel and tested in the current study also revealed no virulence against this gene. Pm21 was previously reported to be located on the short arm of 6VS/6AL translocation chromosome. We constructed a high-density genetic map of chromosome 6A, consisting of 28 PCR markers and the Pm21 gene. A comparison with previously published genetic maps of wheat chromosome 6A revealed that the recombination rate in the 6VS/6AL translocation region was poor. We assume that suppressed recombination caused by the alien H. villosa genetic material is the most reasonable explanation for the tight genetic linkage and the inadequacy between the Pm21 genetic map and the Pm21 physical map of 6A. A large number of sequence-tag sites (STS) and simple sequence repeat markers, which co-segregate with or are closely linked to the Pm21 gene, and the conversion of three resistance gene analog markers into new STS markers, provide a reliable and easy-to-use molecular tool for marker-assisted selection of Pm21 in wheat breeding programs. An additional gene, Pm31, previously reported to be derived from Triticum dicoccoides, was mapped into a similar genomic location to Pm21. Screening of the parental lines and the mapping population with Pm21 diagnostic markers clearly confirmed that the donor line of Pm31 is H. villosa and not T. dicoccoides. Therefore, we conclude that Pm21 and Pm31 refer to the same gene, derived from H. villosa, and that the designation of Pm31 as a new Pm gene was erroneous.

AB Powdery mildew is one of the most destructive foliar diseases of wheat. A set of differential Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates was used to test the powdery mildew response of a Triticum monococcum-derived resistant hexaploid line, Tm27d2. Segregation analysis of 95 F-2:3 lines from a Chinese Spring/Tm27d2 cross revealed that the resistance of Tm27d2 is controlled by a single dominant gene. Using monosomic analysis and a molecular mapping approach, the resistance gene was localized to the terminal end of chromosome 2AL. The linkage map of chromosome 2AL consisted of nine simple sequence repeat markers and one sequence-tagged site (STS) marker (ResPm4) indicative for the Pm4 locus. According to the differential reactions of 19 wheat cultivars/lines with known powdery mildew resistance genes to 13 Bgt isolates, Tm27d2 carried a new resistance specificity. The complete association of the resistance allele with STS marker ResPm4 indicated that it represented a new allele at the Pm4 locus. This new allele was designated Pm4d. The two flanking markers Xgwm526 and Xbarc122 closely linked to Pm4d at genetic distances of 3.4 and 1.0 cM, respectively, are present in chromosome bin 2AL1-0.85-1.00.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive disease that reduces wheat grain yield and quality. To date, the quantitative trait locus on 3BS (Fhb1) from Sumai 3 has shown the largest effect on FHB resistance. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common form of genetic variation and is suitable for high-throughput marker-assisted selection (MAS). We analyzed SNPs derived from 23 wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that previously mapped near Fhb1 on chromosome 3BS. Using 71 Ning 7840/Clark BC7F7 recombinant inbred lines and the single-base extension method, we mapped seven SNP markers between Xgwm533 and Xgwm493, flanking markers for Fhb1. Five of the SNPs explained 45-54% of the phenotypic variation for FHB resistance. Haplotype analysis of 63 wheat accessions from eight countries based on SNPs in EST sequences, simple sequence repeats, and sequence tagged sites in the Fhb1 region identified four major groups: (1) US-Clark, (2) Asian, (3) US-Ernie, and (4) Chinese Spring. The Asian group consisted of Chinese and Japanese accessions that carry Fhb1 and could be differentiated from other groups by marker Xsnp3BS-11. All Sumai 3-related accessions formed a subgroup within the Asian group and could be sorted out by Xsnp3BS-8. The SNP markers identified in this study should be useful for MAS of Fhb1 and fine mapping to facilitate cloning of the Fhb1 resistance gene.

AB We developed Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers for application in genetic studies of Brassica napus and other Brassica species with A or C genomes. Genomic representation from 107 diverse genotypes of B. napus L. var. oleifera (rapeseed, AACC genomes) and B. rapa (AA genome) was used to develop a DArT array comprising 11 520 clones generated using Pstl/Banll and Pstl/BstN1 complexity reduction methods. In total, 1547 polymorphic DArT markers of high technical quality were identified and used to assess molecular diversity among 89 accessions of B. napus, B. rapa, B. juncea, and B. carinata collected from different parts of the world. Hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses based on genetic distance matrices identified distinct populations clustering mainly according to their origin/pedigrees. DArT markers were also mapped in a new doubled haploid population comprising 131 lines from a cross between spring rapeseed lines 'Lynx-037DH' and 'Monty-028DH'. Linkage groups were assigned on the basis of previously mapped simple sequence repeat (SSRs), intron polymorphism (IP), and gene-based markers. The map consisted of 437 DArT, 135 SSR, 6 IP, and 6 gene-based markers and spanned 2288 cM. Our results demonstrate that DArT markers are suitable for genetic diversity analysis and linkage map construction in rapeseed.

Such structures are predicted to be spatially isolated resource patches with frequent population bottlenecks that should influence their genetic structure. Genetic diversity and differentiation among nine populations of T. castaneum collected from wheat and rice mills (ranging from < 1-5,700 km apart) were investigated using eight polymorphic loci (microsatellites and other insertion-deletion polymoiphisms, each with 3-14 alleles). Seventy-two locus-by-population combinations were evaluated, of which 31 deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, all because of a deficiency of heterozygotes. AMOVA analysis indicated significant differences among populations, with 8.3% of the variation in allele frequency resulting from comparisons among populations, and commodity type and geographic region not significant factors. Although there were significant differences in genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST values = 0.018-0.149), genetic distance was not significantly correlated with geographic distance. Correct assignment to the source population was successful for only 56% of individuals collected. Further analyses confirmed the occurrence of recent genetic bottlenecks in five out of nine populations. These results provide evidence that populations of T. castaneum collected from mills show spatial genetic structure, but the poor ability to assign individuals to source populations and lack of isolation by distance suggest greater levels of gene flow than predicted originally.

AB Spike density in barley is under the control of several major genes, as documented previously by genetic analysis of a number of morphological mutants. One such class of mutants affects the rachis internode length leading to dense or compact spikes and the underlying genes were designated dense spike (dsp). We previously delimited two introgressed genomic segments on chromosome 3H (21 SNP loci, 35.5 cM) and 7H (17 SNP loci, 20.34 cM) in BW265, a BC7F3 nearly isogenic line (NIL) of cv. Bowman as potentially containing the dense spike mutant locus dsp.ar, by genotyping 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in both BW265 and its recurrent parent. Here, the gene was allocated by high-resolution bi-parental mapping to a 0.37 cM interval between markers SC57808 (Hv_SPL14)-CAPSK06413 residing on the short and long arm at the genetic centromere of chromosome 7H, respectively. This region putatively contains more than 800 genes as deduced by comparison with the collinear regions of barley, rice, sorghum and Brachypodium, Classical map-based isolation of the gene dsp.ar thus will be complicated due to the infavorable relationship of genetic to physical distances at the target locus.

AB The leaf rust resistance gene Lr25, transferred from Secale cereale L. into wheat and located on chromosome 4B, imparts resistance to all pathotypes of leaf rust in South-East Asia. In an F-2-derived F-3 population, created by crossing TcLr25 that carries the gene Lr25 for leaf rust resistance with leaf rust-susceptible parent Agra Local, three microsatellite markers located on the long arm of chromosome 4B were found to be linked to the Lr25 locus. The donor parent TcLr25 is a near-isogenic line derived from the variety Thatcher. The most virulent pathotype of leaf rust in the South-East Asian region, designated 77-5 (121R63-1), was used for challenging the population under artificially controlled conditions. The marker Xgwm251 behaved as a co-dominant marker placed 3.8 cM away from the Lr25 locus on 4BL. Two null allele markers, Xgwm538 and Xgwm6, in the same linkage group were located at a distance of 3.8 cM and 16.2 cM from the Lr25 locus, respectively. The genetic sequence of Xgwm251, Lr25, Xgwm538, and Xgwm6 covered a total length of 20 cM on 4BL. The markers were validated for their specificity to Lr25 resistance in a set of 43 wheat genetic stocks representing 43 other Lr genes.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the potential breeding value of goatgrass-rye amphiploids, which we are using as a "bridge" in a transfer of Aegilops chromatin (containing, e.g. leaf rust resistance genes) into triticale. We analysed the chromosomal constitution (by genomic in situ hybridisation, GISH), fertility (by pollen viability tests) and the presence of leaf rust and eyespot resistance genes (by molecular and endopeptidase assays) in a collection of 6x and 4x amphiploids originating from crosses between five Aegilops species and Secale cereale. In the five hexaploid amphiploids Aegilops kotschyi x Secale cereale (genome UUSSRR), Ae. variabilis x S. cereale (UUSSRR), Ae. biuncialis x S. cereale (UUMMRR; two lines) and Ae. ovata x S. cereale (UUMMRR), 28 Aegilops chromosomes were recognised, while in the Ae. tauschii x S. cereale amphiploid (4x; DDRR), only 14 such chromosomes were identified. In the materials, the number of rye chromosomes varied from 14 to 16. In one line of Ae. ovata x S. cereale, the U-R translocation was found. Pollen viability varied from 24.4 to 75.4%. The leaf rust resistance genes Lr22, Lr39 and Lr41 were identified in Ae. tauschii and the 4x amphiploid Ae. tauschii x S. cereale. For the first time, the leaf rust resistance gene Lr37 was found in Ae. kotschyi, Ae. ovata, Ae. biuncialis and amphiploids derived from those parental species. No eyespot resistance gene Pch1 was found in the amphiploids.

AB The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), is an important aphid pest of small grain crops especially wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42, genomes AABBDD) in many parts of the world. The greenbug-resistance gene Gb3 originated from Aegilops tauschii Coss. (2n = 2x = 14, genome (DDt)-D-t) has shown consistent and durable resistance against prevailing greenbug biotypes in wheat fields. We previously mapped Gb3 in a recombination-rich, telomeric bin of wheat chromosome arm 7DL. In this study, high-resolution genetic mapping was carried out using an F-2:3 segregating population derived from two Ae. tauschii accessions, the resistant PI 268210 (original donor of Gb3 in the hexaploid wheat germplasm line 'Largo') and susceptible AL8/78. Molecular markers were developed by exploring bin-mapped wheat RFLPs, SSRs, ESTs and the Ae. tauschii physical map (BAC contigs). Wheat EST and Ae. tauschii BAC end sequences located in the deletion bin 7DL3-0.82-1.00 were used to design STS (sequence tagged site) or CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) markers. Forty-five PCR-based markers were developed and mapped to the chromosomal region spanning the Gb3 locus. The greenbug-resistance gene Gb3 now was delimited in an interval of 1.1 cM by two molecular markers (HI067J6-R and HI009B3-R). This localized high-resolution genetic map with markers closely linked to Gb3 lays a solid foundation for map based cloning of Gb3 and marker-assisted selection of this gene in wheat breeding.

AB The modification of flowering date is considered an important way to escape the current or future climatic constraints that affect wheat crops. A better understanding of its genetic bases would enable a more efficient and rapid modification through breeding. The objective of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with earliness in wheat. A 227-wheat core collection chosen to be highly contrasted for earliness was characterized for heading date. Experiments were conducted in controlled conditions and in the field for 3 years to break down earliness in the component traits: photoperiod sensitivity, vernalization requirement and narrow-sense earliness. Whole-genome association mapping was carried out using 760 molecular markers and taking into account the five ancestral group structure. We identified 62 markers individually associated to earliness components corresponding to 33 chromosomal regions. In addition, we identified 15 other significant markers and seven more regions by testing marker pair interactions. Co-localizations were observed with the Ppd-1, Vrn-1 and Rht-1 candidate genes. Using an independent set of lines to validate the model built for heading date, we were able to explain 34% of the variation using the structure and the significant markers. Results were compared with already published data using bi-parental populations giving an insight into the genetic architecture of flowering time in wheat.

AB The cisgenesis concept implies that plants are transformed only with their own genetic materials or genetic materials from closely related species capable of sexual hybridization. Furthermore, foreign sequences such as selection genes and vector-backbone sequences should be absent. We used a barley phytase gene (HvPAPhy_a) expressed during grain filling to evaluate the cisgenesis concept in barley. The marker gene elimination method was used to obtain marker-free plant lines. Here, the gene of interest and the selection gene are flanked by their own T-DNA borders to allow unlinked integration of the two genes. We analysed the transformants for co-transformation efficiency, increased phytase activities in the grain, integration of the kanamycin resistance gene of the vector-backbone and segregation between the HvPAPhy_a insert and the hygromycin resistance gene. The frequencies of the four parameters imply that it should be possible to select 11 potentially cisgenic T1-lines out of the 72 T0-lines obtained, indicating that the generation of cisgenic barley is possible at reasonable frequencies with present methods. We selected two potential cisgenic lines with a single extra copy of the HvPAPhy_a insert for further analysis. Seeds from plants homozygous for the insert showed 2.6- and 2.8-fold increases in phytase activities and the activity levels were stable over the three generations analysed. In one of the selected lines, the flanking sequences from both the left and right T-DNA borders were analysed. These sequences confirmed the absence of truncated vector-backbone sequences linked to the borders. The described line should therefore be classified as cisgenic.

AB This study analyzed the differences in karyotype and genetic variation between a mutant and wild-type Siraitia grosvenorii. Genetic variation included changes in genome and gene expression by SRAP molecular markers. Results showed that wild-type S. grosvenorii was diploid, with a chromosome number of 2n = 2x = 28, whereas the mutant was tetraploid with a chromosome number of 2n = 4x = 56. 4573 DNA bands were obtained using 189 different primer combinations, 577 of which were polymorphic, averaging 3.1 bands for each primer pair, while 1998 pairs were identical. There were no apparent differences on bands amplified by most primer pairs. After comparing the diploid and tetraploid strains, the data generally indicated that the polymorphism would be quite low. 2917 cDNA bands were generated using 133 primer combinations, and stable and clearly differential fragments were sorted out, cloned and sequenced. Ninety-two differentially expressed fragments were successfully sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that most fragments had significant homologous nucleotide sequences with resistant to stress and photosynthesis genes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, peroxisomal membrane transporter, NBS-LRR type resistance protein, protein phosphatase and others. The results revealed that the tetraploid strain has more resistant and photosynthesis ability than its diploid relatives, which providing reference information and resources for molecular breeding and seedless Luohanguo.

AB Background: Identification of genes underlying drought tolerance (DT) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) will facilitate understanding of molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance, and also will accelerate genetic improvement of pearl millet through marker-assisted selection. We report a map based on genes with assigned functional roles in plant adaptation to drought and other abiotic stresses and demonstrate its use in identifying candidate genes underlying a major DT-QTL.
   Results: Seventy five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and conserved intron spanning primer (CISP) markers were developed from available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using four genotypes, H 77/833-2, PRLT 2/89-33, ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01004, representing parents of two mapping populations. A total of 228 SNPs were obtained from 30.5 kb sequenced region resulting in a SNP frequency of 1/134 bp. The positions of major pearl millet linkage group (LG) 2 DT-QTLs (reported from crosses H 77/833-2 x PRLT 2/89-33 and 841B x 863B) were added to the present consensus function map which identified 18 genes, coding for PSI reaction center subunit III, PHYC, actin, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase, uridylate kinase, acyl-CoA oxidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, MADS-box, serine/threonine protein kinase, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, zinc finger C- x 8-C x 5-C x 3-H type, Hd3, acetyl CoA carboxylase, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, photolyase, protein phosphatase1 regulatory subunit SDS22 and two hypothetical proteins, co-mapping in this DT-QTL interval. Many of these candidate genes were found to have significant association with QTLs of grain yield, flowering time and leaf rolling under drought stress conditions.
   Conclusions: We have exploited available pearl millet EST sequences to generate a mapped resource of seventy five new gene-based markers for pearl millet and demonstrated its use in identifying candidate genes underlying a major DT-QTL in this species. The reported gene-based markers represent an important resource for identification of candidate genes for other mapped abiotic stress QTLs in pearl millet. They also provide a resource for initiating association studies using candidate genes and also for comparing the structure and function of distantly related plant genomes such as other Poaceae members.

AB Background: Distinguishing between individuals is critical to those conducting animal/plant breeding, food safety/quality research, diagnostic and clinical testing, and evolutionary biology studies. Classical genetic identification studies are based on marker polymorphisms, but polymorphism-based techniques are time and labor intensive and often cannot distinguish between closely related individuals. Illumina sequencing technologies provide the detailed sequence data required for rapid and efficient differentiation of related species, lines/cultivars, and individuals in a cost-effective manner. Here we describe the use of Illumina high-throughput exome sequencing, coupled with SNP mapping, as a rapid means of distinguishing between related cultivars of the lignocellulosic bioenergy crop giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus). We provide the first exome sequence database for Miscanthus species complete with Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations.
   Results: A SNP comparative analysis of rhizome-derived cDNA sequences was successfully utilized to distinguish three Miscanthus x giganteus cultivars from each other and from other Miscanthus species. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic tree generated from SNP frequency data parallels the known breeding history of the plants examined. Some of the giant miscanthus plants exhibit considerable sequence divergence.
   Conclusions: Here we describe an analysis of Miscanthus in which high-throughput exome sequencing was utilized to differentiate between closely related genotypes despite the current lack of a reference genome sequence. We functionally annotated the exome sequences and provide resources to support Miscanthus systems biology. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the commercial high-performance cloud computing to do computational GO annotation.

AB In a previous work, deduced amino acid sequences from twenty wheat peroxidase genes were assigned to seven groups designated as TaPrx108 to TaPrx114. Some of these apoplasdc peroxidases have previously shown to play different roles in the plant defense responses to infection by the cereal cyst nematode Heterodera avenae. In the present study, PCR marker analysis using Sears's aneuploid wheat lines cv. 'Chinese Spring' was used to locate four genes encoding peroxidase isozymes. The TaPrx111-A, TaPrx112-D and TaPrx113-F genes were located on the short arm of chromosome 2B and the TaPrx109-C on the long arm of chromosome 1B. These results would agree with the synteny between wheat and rice chromosomes previously established in other studies.

AB This study was carried out to evaluate the genetic effect of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring drought tolerance in wheat. A population of 120 F-2 individuals from the cross between the drought-tolerant S-78-11 and drought-sensitive Tajan cultivars were analyzed for their segregation under drought stress conditions. The relative water content under drought stress conditions exhibited continuous variation, indicating the minor gene effects on the trait. Single-marker analysis (SMA) was carried out to detect the main QTL association with drought tolerance. The SMA results revealed that the simple sequence repeat markers GWM182 and GWM292 on chromosome 5D and GWM410 on chromosome 5A exhibited significant association with drought tolerance, accounting for 30, 22, and 21% of the total variation, respectively. The 3 genetic loci, especially GWM182, can be used in marker-assisted selection methods in drought tolerance breeding in wheat.

AB We developed EST-PCR markers specific to barley chromosome 2H, for the purpose of effectively tracing alien chromosomes or chromosome parts in the wheat genetic background. The target alien chromosome 2H confers high resistance to pre-harvest sprouting, which is a worldwide natural disaster in wheat. A total of 120 primer pairs were selected by combining the wheat group 2 chromosomes of the EST database and the genome sequences of the new model plant Brachypodium distachyon. Seventy-seven of 120 primer pairs were polymorphic and 31 of 120 primer pairs were monomorphic between a set of wheat-barley chromosome 2H disomic addition/substitution lines and their parents by agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thirty of 77 polymorphic primer pairs including primer pair P120 derived from the basi gene were chromosome 2H-specific. These markers are expected to be valuable in screening of wheat-barley chromosome 2H recombination lines and pre-harvest sprouting resistant varieties.

AB Phenotypic assessment of yield and its component traits needs to be performed in replicated trials under multiple environments. Mapping populations such as doubled haploids (DHs) are suitable material for studying marker-trait associations, because they can be evaluated repeatedly in different years or in variable environments, thus having considerable potential for the identification of reliable quantitative trait loci. In the present study a DH mapping population, generated from the crossing of two hexaploid high yield potential wheat varieties, Savannah (UK) and Renesansa (SRB), was used to identify associations between five microsatellite markers and seven spike-related traits. Statistically significant associations were observed between marker GWM261 on 2DS chromosome and six spike-related traits: spike length, spikelet number per spike, sterile spikelet number per spike, grain weight, spike weight and spike index. The phenotypic variation explained by this marker was the highest for the trait spike length (from 8.3 to 24.7%).

AB The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), is a major pest of wheat worldwide. In this research, 14 Tunisian bread wheat genotypes were evaluated for resistance to S. graminum. Eight cultivars were scored as susceptible with an average injury level varying between 7.7 and 9. Three cultivars were moderately resistant (4.0 - 6.0) and three expressed high levels of resistance (1.2 - 2.0). A previously described SSR marker (Xwmc634) cosegregating with the Gb3 greenbug resistance gene in wheat was identified in 'Adana 66' cultivar, suggesting the presence of Gb3 in this cultivar. Based on these results, we conclude that 'Ariana 66' should be incorporated in wheat breeding programs for resistance against greenbug, in Tunisia, as a local adapted source of Gb3. Additionally, cultivars 'Soltane 73' and 'EAP63A', which expressed high levels of resistance and did not express the SSR marker associated with Gb3, could be taken into consideration for diversifying the genetic basis of greenbug resistance in wheat breeding programs.

AB The nutritive value of alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) is slightly lower than that of red and white clovers; however, it exhibits some advantages - persists longer in a sward, performs well on acid and wet soils, suits for forage and silage production, can be used as green manure, and is a melliferous plant. With declining liming volumes, the soils are rapidly acidifying, which may result in an increasing alsike clover production area.
   To reveal plant diversity, the methods currently employed encompass not only research into agro-biological traits but also biochemical-molecular assays. The inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) technique is one of the DNA assay methods widely used in genetic diversity studies, genetic evolution and systematic specification, and gene mapping. The current study was aimed to assess individual plants of T hybridum varieties ('Daubiai', 'Lomiai', 'Poliai', 'Skriveru') for morphological traits, quality parameters and genetic diversity and to establish the correlations between the ISSR markers and characteristics of agro-biological traits.
   Morphological diversity was estimated according to 10 traits. The coefficient of variation varied within a wide range (CV 0.6-71.9%). The parameters of feeding value were found to be most stable (CV 0.6-16.6%), while seed yield was the most variable indicator (CV 38.7-71.9%). According to the values of agro-biolouical traits, the individual plants conditionally split into 4 sub-clusters, encompassing different varieties.
   Five primers were used to reveal the DNA diversity of alsike clover. A total of 37 fragments were amplified, of which 62.2% were polymorphic. Genetically most distant were individuals of 'Lomiai' and 'Daubiai' cultivars. The dendrograms produced according to the values of agro-biological and genetic distances were not identical. The ISSR markers were found to correlate with the following alsike clover traits: seed yield, stem number and height, crude protein and water soluble carbohydrate contents.

AB The aim of the study was to select wheat-Aegilops biuncialis addition lines carrying Aegilops biuncialis chromosomes differing from those which were introgressed into the wheat-Ae. biuncialis addition lines produced earlier in Martonvasar, Hungary. In the course of the experiments new wheat-Ae. biuncialis addition lines carrying chromosomes 2U(b), 6M(b), 6U(b); 5U(b), 3U(b), 7U(b); 5M(b), 6M(b) and 7M(b) were selected. The 2U(b) disomic addition line is relatively stable, as 91% of the progenies contain this chromosome pair. The 6M(b) disomic addition line proved to be dwarf and sterile, but it still exists as a monosomic addition line. Progenies analysed from the 6U(b) monosomic addition line did not carry the 6U(b) chromosome. One plant containing the 5U(b), 3U(b) and 7U(b) chromosomes and one plant carrying 5M(b), 6M(b) and 7M(b) chromosomes showed very low fertility. Each of the plants produced a single seed, but seeds of the parent plants are still available. Line No. 49/00 carried a submetacentric Ae. biuncialis chromosome pair and the chromosome number 44 has been constant for several generations. After FISH no hybridisation site was observed on the Ae. biuncialis chromosome pair using the pSc119.2 and Afa family repetitive DNA probes, so it was not possible to identify the Ae. biuncialis chromosome pair. However, the use of wheat SSR markers and the (GAA)(n) microsatellite DNA probe allowed it to be characterised more accurately. These new lines facilitate gene transfer from Ae. biuncialis into cultivated wheat and the selection of U and M genome-specific wheat SSR markers.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating wheat disease worldwide. The Chinese wheat cultivar Chuanmai 32 has shown stable resistance to stripe rust for 10 yr in Sichuan Province, a hotspot for stripe rust epidemics. The objective of the present study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in a population of 140 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Chuanmai 32/Chuanyu 12. Field trials were conducted in Chengdu and Yaan, Sichuan, from 2005 to 2008, providing stripe rust reaction data for 6 environments. 797 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened for association with stripe rust reaction, initially through bulked segregant analysis (BSA). Based on the mean disease values averaged across environments, the broad-sense heritability of maximum disease severity (MDS) was 0.75. Two QTLs for stripe rust resistance were detected by composite interval mapping (CIM). They were designated QYr.caas-3BL and QYr.caas-3BS and explained from 6.6 to 20.1%, respectively, of the phenotypic variance across environments. QYr.caas-3BL came from Chuanmai 32; QYr.caas-3BS with lower effect was from the susceptible parent Chuanyu 12. Both QTLs appear to be new.

AB Pyramiding of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can be an effective approach for developing durable resistance to powdery mildew in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The Chinese wheat cultivars Bainong 64 and Lumai 21, with outstanding agronomic traits, possess four and three QTLs, respectively, for adult-plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew. To achieve optimal durable resistance, 21 F-6 lines combining two-five powdery mildew APR QTLs were developed from the cross Bainong 64/Lumai 21 using a modified pedigree selection. These lines were planted in a randomised complete block design with two replicates in Beijing during the 2009-10 and 2010-11 cropping seasons, and were evaluated for powdery mildew response using the highly virulent Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolate E20. Based on the phenotypic data of both maximum disease severity (MDS) and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), analysis of variance indicated that there were highly significant effects of QTL combinations on reducing powdery mildew MDS and AUDPC. Six pyramided QTL combinations possessing QPm.caas-1A and QPm.caas-4DL in common along with one or more of the others expressed better APR to powdery mildew than the more resistant parent, Bainong 64. Thus, pyramiding these two QTLs with one or more of QPm.caas-2BS, QPm.caas-2BL, and QPm.caas-2DL from Lumai 21 could be a desirable strategy to breed cultivars with high levels of durable resistance to powdery mildew. Experienced breeders with a good knowledge of minor genes can achieve APR by phenotypic selection, and selection by molecular markers will still require uniform field testing for powdery mildew and disease phenotype to validate the resistance. These results provided very useful information for pyramiding APR QTLs in wheat breeding programs.

AB Breeding for drought tolerance in grain crops is not a generic issue. Periods of drought vary in length, timing and intensity and different traits are important with different types of drought. The search for generic drought tolerance using single-gene transformations has been disappointing. It has typically concentrated on survival of plants suffering from severe water stress, which is rarely an important trait in crops. More promising approaches that target complex traits tailored to specific requirements at the different main stages of the life of a crop, during: establishment, vegetative development, floral development and grain growth are outlined. The challenge is to devise inexpensive and effective ways of identifying promising phenotypes with the aim of aligning them with genomic information to identify molecular markers useful to breeders. Controlled environments offer the stability to search for attractive phenotypes or genotypes in a specific type of drought. The recent availability of robots for measuring large number of plants means that large numbers of genotypes can be readily phenotyped. However, controlled environments differ greatly from those in the field. Devising pot experiments that cater for important yield-determining processes in the field is difficult, especially when water is limiting. Thus, breeders are unlikely to take much notice of research in controlled environments unless the worth of specific traits has been demonstrated in the field. An essential link in translating laboratory research to the field is the development of novel genotypes that incorporate gene(s) expressing a promising trait into breeding lines that are adapted to target field environments. Only if the novel genotypes perform well in the field are they likely to gain the interest of breeders. High throughput phenotyping will play a pivotal role in this process.

AB Diploid Thinopyrum elongatum, a wild relative of wheat, contains many agronomically desirable traits and has potential for increasing genetic variability and introducing desirable characters in this crop. Few molecular markers are available for rapid screening of T. elongatum genome segments in the wheat genetic background. We used 36 RAPD primers and 33 ISSR primers to screen for polymorphisms in the common wheat variety Chinese Spring and in T. elongatum. Two RAPD markers and one ISSR marker, designated OPF03(1407), LW10(1487) and UBC841(701), were identified and were specific for the T. elongatum E genome. Three pairs of primers flanking these specific sequences were designed to produce SCAR markers. All three SCAR markers were T. elongatum E genome-specific. Two of these SCAR markers, SCAR(807) and SCAR(577), were present in all seven T. elongatum chromosomes, while SCAR(839) was specific for T. elongatum chromosomes 2E and 3E. These newly developed SCAR markers should be useful for detecting alien genome chromatin or chromosome segments in the genetic background of common wheat.

Samples of leaf rust were obtained from different parts of the Slovak Republic. A total of 122 wheat leaf rust isolates were analysed. Resistance gene Lr19 was effective to all tested isolates. Virulence to Lr9 was found, however only in one isolate. Gene Lr24 conditioned resistance to almost all rust collections. A lower frequency of virulence to Lr2a and Lr28 was also observed. Nineteen winter wheat cultivars grown in Slovakia were tested with 8 leaf rust isolates. Winter wheat cultivar Bona Dea was resistant to all isolates applied in the greenhouse test. Presence of Lr genes was estimated according to the reactions of the tested cultivars. Presence of Lr10, Lr26, Lr34 and Lr37 was studied by molecular markers.

AB The aim of this study was to compare Mycosphaerella graminicola populations at the field and lesion levels. The evolution of M. graminicola populations from a single field in the "Morbihan" county (France), between 2005 and 2006, was first investigated for 37 strains using molecular fingerprinting by microsatellite markers (ST1A4, ST1E3, ST1E7 and ST1D7) and SSCP analysis of partial actin and beta-tubulin encoding sequences. Similar gene diversity was observed in the 2005 and 2006 populations, with no common clones between the two years. This indicates frequent sexual recombination by the fungus. When considering each marker independently and comparing marker genetic variability for the two populations, differences in the genetic variability were detected in 2006 population compared to the 2005 population. ST1A4, ST1D7 and the partial sequence of actin presented a decrease in genetic variability of the 2006 strains, while for ST1E3, ST1E7 and the partial sequence of beta-tubulin showed an increase, revealing the importance of the chosen markers. In addition, 29 strains collected in 2006 from three distinct lesions on the same wheat leaf in the "Nord" county were also investigated for genetic diversity. MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 were found in the same lesion offering opportunities for sexual contact.

AB The greenbug Schizaphis graminum, is a major pest of wheat worldwide. Biotype screening of this pest is essential to develop pest management programs. In this research, eight greenbug clones, collected on wheat in the cereal-growing region of Beja (north Tunisia), were used to determine their damage on six reference wheat cultivars. All tested clones shared a unique biotypic profile, similar to biotype C. Moreover, DNA from the tested clones and that from seven reference clones of biotypes C, E, F, G, H, I and K, was analyzed, using 5 RAPD-PCR primers. The UPGMA method clustered samples into two distinct clades: a first one (I) included clones from north Tunisia, which were clearly associated to agricultural biotypes C, E, I and K, while a second clade (II) included non agricultural biotypes F, G and H. Results reported in this paper suggest that resistance genes Gb2, Gb3, Gb4, Gb5 and Gb6 in wheat would be the most efficient if used in wheat improvement programs for resistance against greenbug in Tunisia.

AB Wide hybridization expands the gene pool of cultivated species and can produce genotypes with practical value, often resistant to diseases. In plants, ISSRs are often used for hybrid identification as well as for diversity evaluation. We estimated genetic similarity among advanced genetic stocks of triticale hybrids and identified Aegilops juvenalis introgressions into triticale. Fourteen ISSR primers amplified from 12 to 23 DNA fragments. The number of polymorphic products per primer ranged from three to nine, with a mean of 5.1. The polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.39 to 0.66, with a mean of 0.52. Thirteen primers amplified products indicating presence of A. juvenalis chromatin. The largest mean genetic similarity (0.84) with all other forms was shown by a strain derived from an A. juvenalis 6x x [(Lanca x L506/79) x CZR142/79] hybrid, while A. juvenalis was the least similar (0.33). We conclude that ISSRs can reliably identify A. juvenalis chromatin in the triticale background and efficiently estimate genetic similarity of hybrids and parental forms.

AB Leaf rust is one of the most destructive diseases affecting wheat worldwide. The most effective way to control it is to use resistant cultivars. Resistance based on slow-rusting adult plant resistance (APR) genes has proven to be the best method for developing cultivars with durable resistance. A source of slow-rusting APR for leaf rust is the Brazilian wheat cultivar Toropi. The Toropi/IAC 13 F-2 and F-7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed in previous studies. Phenotypic analysis of the F-2 and F-7 RILs showed that 2 recessive genes that were temporarily named trp-1 and trp-2 conferred APR in Toropi. In the present study, we used monosomic families and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), sequence-tagged site, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to map trp-1 and trp-2 on wheat chromosomes. Analysis of the F-2 monosomic RIL showed that trp-1 and trp-2 were located on chromosomes 1A and 4D, respectively. AFLP analysis of the F-7 RIL identified 2 independent AFLP markers, XPacgMcac3 and XPacgMcac6, which were associated with Toropi APR. These markers explained 71.5% of the variation in the phenotypic data in a multiple linear regression model. The AFLP markers XPacg/Mcac3 and XPacg/Mcac6 were anchored by SSR markers previously mapped on the short arms of chromosomes 1A (1AS) and 4D (4DS), respectively. The trp-2 gene is the first leaf rust resistance gene mapped on wheat chromosome 4DS. The mapping of trp-1 and trp-2 provides novel and valuable information that could be used in future studies involving the fine mapping of these genes, as well as in the identification of molecular markers that are closely related to these genes for marker-assisted selection of this important trait in wheat.

ID LEAF RUST; GENE; INTERMEDIUM; INHERITANCE; LOCATION
AB Leymus mollis, a perennial allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 28), known as American dune grass, is a wild relative of wheat that could be useful for cultivar improvement. Shannong0096, developed from interspecific hybridization between common wheat cv. Yannong15 and L. mollis, was analyzed with cytological procedures, genomic in situ hybridization, stripe-rust resistance screening and molecular marker analysis. We found that Shannong0096 has 42 chromosomes in the root-tip cells at mitotic metaphase and 21 bivalents in the pollen mother cells at meiotic metaphase I, demonstrating cytogenetic stability. Genomic in situ hybridization probed with total genomic DNA from L. mollis gave strong hybridization signals in the distal region of two wheat chromosome arms. A single dominant Yr gene, derived from L. mollis and temporarily designated as YrSn0096, was found on the long arm of chromosome 4A of Shannong0096. YrSn0096 should be a novel Yr gene because none of the previously reported Yr genes on chromosome 4A are related to L. mollis. This gene was found to be closely linked to the loci Xbarc236 and Xksum134 with genetic distances of 5.0 and 4.8 cM, respectively. Based on data from 267 F-2 plants of Yannong15/Huixianhong, the linkage map of YrSn0096, using the two molecular markers, was established in the order Xbarc236-YrSn0096-Xksum134. Shannong0096 appeared to be a unique wheat-L. mollis translocation with cryptic alien introgression. Cytogenetic stability, a high level of stripe-rust resistance, the common wheat background, and other positive agronomic traits make it a desirable donor for introducing novel alien resistance genes in wheat breeding programs, with the advantage of molecular markers that can be used to confirm introgression.

AB Water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) stored in the stems and leaf sheaths of winter cereals provide an important source of assimilate for remobilisation during grain-filling. Consequently, WSC are a major contributor to wheat grain yield and grain size in all environments but especially where photosynthesis is compromised as occurs where water is limiting. Breeding programs targeting greater WSC should provide improved varieties with greater and more stable yields in stress environments. To facilitate selection for WSC, genetic and genomic approaches are being used to determine the genetic basis of - and define DNA probes for - marker-aided selection for this important drought-adaptive trait. Empirical studies have identified both WSC concentration and content to be under complex genetic control of many genes. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for WSC have been identified in several wheat populations with individual QTL explaining small amounts of phenotypic variation, typically of less than 20%. Many of these QTL are common across multiple, genetically-unrelated wheat populations. Evaluation of gene expression in high and low WSC wheat progeny lines from a well characterised wheat population has identified significant differences in expression of genes from different gene categories. For example, high WSC progeny lines have higher levels of expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and lower levels of expression of genes involved in cell wall and amino acid metabolism than low WSC lines. Genetic mapping reveals several candidate genes co-locating with QTL for WSC. In addition, expression QTL (eQTL) for selected candidate genes co-locate with WSC QTL; co-location of the genes and eQTL with WSC QTL make these genes stronger candidate genes for the WSC trait.

AB Founder parents have contributed significantly to the improvement of wheat. Beijing 8 has been used as a founder parent in developing many outstanding improved cultivars in China. The widely grown cultivars Beijing 8 and 6 additional derivatives both derived from the cross 'Bima 4 x Early Premium' in China, were characterised using seven morphological traits and 537 microsatellite markers. Phenotypic comparisons revealed that Beijing 8 was similar for certain characteristics to the widely grown cultivars Shijiazhuang 54 and Jinan 2, hinting that acceptable performance for yield components may be the basis for Beijing 8 serving as a founder parent. Simple sequence repeat analysis indicated that Bima 4 contributed more genome information to the derivatives than Early Premium. Fifty-nine unique simple sequence repeat alleles, present in Beijing 8 and absent in other cultivars, were observed. Nearly all loci were in close proximity to the positions of known genes conferring important traits. Furthermore, pedigree tracking found that the frequencies of alleles unique to Beijing 8 varied from 0 to 0.96 in its 51 descendants, suggesting that some of them underwent rigorous selection during breeding.

AB Grain quality is an important determinant of market value of wheat in southern Australia and in many other parts of the world. Identification of the genes that influence grain quality traits and estimation of effects of alleles of these genes can improve the effectiveness of wheat breeding. An efficient method for estimating the effects of alleles of recently discovered genes is to use mixed-model analyses in large plant breeding datasets that have already been characterised for previously known genes. We used this method to estimate the effects of two alleles of Spa-B1, a storage protein activator gene that is linked to Glu-B1, on grain quality traits. Alleles of the two genes tracked together as haplotypes for generations, but recombination events were identified. These recombination events were used to enhance confidence in identification of the alleles. The effects of the alleles of Spa-B1 were small and statistically not significant for all of the grain quality traits in our population.

AB Wheat breeding during the 20th century has put large efforts into reducing straw length and increasing harvest index. In the 1920s an allele of Rht8 with dwarfing effects, found in the Japanese cultivar "Akakomugi," was bred into European cultivars and subsequently spread over the world. Rht8 has not been cloned, but the microsatellite marker WMS261 has been shown to be closely linked to it and is commonly used for genotyping Rht8. The "Akakomugi" allele is strongly associated with WMS261-192bp. Numerous screens of wheat cultivars with different geographical origin have been performed to study the spread and influence of the WMS261-192bp during 20th century plant breeding. However, the allelic diversity of WMS261 in wheat cultivars before modern plant breeding and introduction of the Japanese dwarfing genes is largely unknown. Here, we report a study of WMS261 allelic diversity in a historical wheat collection from 1865 representing worldwide major wheats at the time. The majority carried the previously reported 164 bp or 174 bp allele, but with little geographical correlation. In a few lines, a rare 182 bp fragment was found. Although straw length was recognized as an important character already in the 19th century, Rht8 probably played a minor role for height variation. The use of WMS261 and other functional markers for analyses of historical specimens and characterization of historic crop traits is discussed.

AB To develop a set of molecular markers specific for the chromosome arms of rye, a total of 1,098 and 93 primer pairs derived from the expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences distributed on all 21 wheat chromosomes and 7 rye chromosomes, respectively, were initially screened on common wheat 'Chinese Spring' and rye cultivar 'Imperial'. Four hundred and fourteen EST-based markers were specific for the rye genome. Seven disomic chromosome addition lines, 10 telosomic addition lines and 1 translocation line of 'Chinese Spring-Imperial' were confirmed by genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization, and used to screen the rye-specific markers. Thirty-one of the 414 markers produced stable specific amplicons in 'Imperial', as well as individual addition lines and were assigned to 13 chromosome arms of rye except for 6RS. Six rye cultivars, wheat cultivar 'Xiaoyan 6' and accessions of 4 wheat relatives were then used to test the specificity of the 31 EST-based markers. To confirm the specificity, 4 wheat-rye derivatives of 'Xiaoyan 6 x German White', with chromosomes 1RS, 2R and 4R, were amplified by some of the EST-based markers. The results indicated that they can effectively be used to detect corresponding rye chromosomes or chromosome arms introgressed into a wheat background, and hence to accelerate the utilization of rye genes in wheat breeding.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Psi), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To diversify stripe rust-resistant resources for wheat breeding programs, a CIMMYT synthetic wheat line CI110 was identified to be resistant to 28 isolates of Pst, including 6 Chinese prevalent races CYR28-CYR33. Genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene was responsible for the stripe rust resistance in CI110, temporarily designated YrC110. A molecular map, harboring YrC110 and 9 linked SSR markers, was constructed through simple sequence repeat (SSR), and bulked segregant analysis. These linked markers and YrC110 were assigned on the short arm of chromosome 1B using the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic stocks. Gene postulation based on seedling reaction patterns to 30 Pst isolates suggested that the resistance gene YrC110 seemed different from the other known resistance genes tested, such as Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr24, and Yr26/YrCH42. Four SSR markers Xbarc187(150), Xgwm18(227), Xgwm11(223), and Xbarc240(292) distinguished YrC110 from Yr10, Yr15, Yr24, and Yr26/YrCH42, and could be used as diagnostic ones for YrC110 in wheat resistant breeding programs against stripe rust.

AB The German wheat cultivar Ibis has excellent adult plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in Gansu, a hotspot for stripe rust in China. To elucidate the genetic basis of APR to stripe rust in Ibis, 237 F-3 lines derived from the cross Ibis/Huixianhong were evaluated at Tianshui, Gansu, in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 cropping seasons, and at Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, in the 2009-2010 cropping season. Inoculations were conducted with a mixture of several prevalent Pst races in both locations. Maximum disease severity (MDS) data showed a continuous distribution of response, indicating quantitative nature of resistance to stripe rust in Ibis. The broad-sense heritability of MDS was 0.75 based on the mean values averaged across three environments. A total of 723 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the QTL for APR by inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). QTLs mapping to chromosomes 2BS and 6BS, designated as QYr.caas-2BS.1 and QYr.caas-6BS.1, respectively, explained 4.1-40.7% of the phenotypic variance in MDS across environments. The major effect QTL QYr.caas-2BS.1, flanked by Xgwm148 and Xwmc360, was consistently detected at all three sites as well as the averaged data over three environments, accounting for 40.7, 24.2, 5.2 and 29.9% of phenotypic variance, respectively. The molecular markers closely linked to this QTL have potential for use in marker-assisted selection and gene pyramiding to improve the durability of stripe rust resistance in wheat breeding.

AB To identify amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers associated with resistance or susceptibility of alfalfa to common leafspot (CLS) caused by the fungus Pseudopeziza medicaginis (Dermateaceae), bulked segregant analysis was conducted based on an F-1(M x M) population of 93 plants and a BC1S population of 91 plants. Three AFLP markers, ACTCAA(R206), TAGCAC(R185), and GGACTA(S264), were found to be associated with CLS resistance or susceptibility. All three markers were found at significantly different frequencies (71.9, 80.3 and 91.8%) compared to resistant or susceptible plants in the original population. Subsequently, these three AFLP markers were converted into three SCAR markers, ACTCAA(R136), TAGCAC(R128) and GGACTA(S254), which are easier to employ in breeding programs. The three SCAR markers were used in a randomly selected population with 50% resistance; the probability of finding one resistant plant was increased to 67.3, 66.7 and 90.0% with markers ACTCAA(R136), TAGCAC(R128) and GGACTA(S254), independently. If two of the SCAR markers were used simultaneously, the probability would be higher than 89%. The three SCAR markers identified in this study would be applicable for selection for CLS resistance in alfalfa breeding programs. Moreover, the genetic analysis indicated that CLS resistance in alfalfa is conferred by a single dominant gene.

AB High quality bread is an important goal for wheat breeders. Glutenins, are considered key factors in improving bread quality, particularly HMW-GS, as they are the main contributors to bread quality. The HMW-GS are known to be encoded by six genes located at the Glu-1 loci on the log arms of chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D. Sequence-specific primers were used to screen for HMW-GS genes within a collection of twenty nine local and elite spring bread wheat accessions adapted to irrigated agriculture. Eight gene-specific markers were used to screen for high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes to identify glutenin harboring alleles in each accession. The 29 genotypes showed eight different allelic combinations at the Glu A. Glu B and Glu D loci. Results showed that 26 genotypes carried the Ax1 allele and only 3 genotypes carried the Ax2 allele. At the B loci there were four different allelic combinations. The Bx7+By8 alleles were present in 6 genotypes, the Bx7*+By8 alleles were found in one genotype (Lang), the Bx7+By9 alleles were observed in 13 genotypes and the Bx17+By18 alleles were observed in 9 genotypes. At the D loci there were two allelic combinations. The Dx2+Dy12 were present in 14 genotypes while the Dx5+Dy10 were found in 15 genotypes. All the American varieties tested carried the Dx5+By10 alleles which were associated with excellent bread making quality (score of 10). The Australian lines had a very good bread making quality with an average 8.6, followed by CIMMYT varieties with an average score of 8.25. Many of the local Arabian lines lacked the favorable alleles DX5+Dy10 and had an average quality score of 8. The presence of HMW-GS in the tested genotypes were confirmed using PCR assay. The information generated in this study will be utilized in the breading program for parental selection and identification of new lines with high quality glutenin alleles.

AB Musa (Family Musaceae) is economically the fourth most-important crop after rice, wheat, and maize. Present-day edible banana evolved by intra- and inter-specific hybridisation of two wild species M. acuminata and M. balbisiana. A total of 229 primers were designed based on a survey of the genomic sequence data available on Musa spp. in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Twenty-six microsatellite (SSR) markers were amplified in 15 banana accessions. These 26 SSR markers revealed a total of 88 alleles, ranging from two-to-six alleles per locus, with an average of 3.38 alleles per locus. Genetic analysis resulted in observed heterozygosity (H-o) values ranging from 0.06 - 0.80, with a mean of 0.40. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.21 - 0.77, with a mean of 0.47. A dendogram based on the SSR data grouped the 15 different banana accessions into three groups. These new SSR markers may be of value for future characterisation of banana germplasm, gene mapping, and genetic analysis.

AB The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Stephens' has been grown commercially in the USA Pacific Northwest for 30 years. The durable resistance of 'Stephens' to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) was believed to be due to a combination of seedling and adult plant resistance genes. Multilocation field trials, diversity array technology (DArT), and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance. Recombinant inbred lines were assessed for stripe rust response in eight locations/years, five in 2008 and three in 2009. The data from Mt. Vernon, WA, differed from all other environments, and composite interval mapping (CIM) identified three QTL, QYrst.orr-1AL, QYrst.orr-4BS, and QYrpl.orr-6AL, which accounted for 12, 11, and 6% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. CIM across the remaining six environments identified four main QTL. Two QTL, QYrst.orr-2BS. 2 and QYrst.orr-7AS, were detected in five of six environments and explained 11 and 15% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Two other QTL, QYrst.orr-2AS and QYrpl.orr-4BL, were detected across four and three of six environments, and explained 19 and 9% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. The susceptible parent 'Platte' contributed QYrpl.orr-4BL and QYrpl.orr-6AL, with the remaining QTL originating from 'Stephens'. For each environment, additional minor QTL were detected, each accounting for 6-10% of the phenotypic variance. Different QTL with moderate effects were identified in both 'Stephens' and 'Platte'. Significant QTL 9 environment interactions were evident, suggesting that specificity to plant stage, pathogen genotype, and/or temperature was important.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola, is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat. We screened five synthetic hexaploid wheats (SHs), 13 wheat varieties that represent the differential set of cultivars and two susceptible checks with a global set of 20 isolates and discovered exceptionally broad STB resistance in SHs. Subsequent development and analyses of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between the SH M3 and the highly susceptible bread wheat cv. Kulm revealed two novel resistance loci on chromosomes 3D and 5A. The 3D resistance was expressed in the seedling and adult plant stages, and it controlled necrosis (N) and pycnidia (P) development as well as the latency periods of these parameters. This locus, which is closely linked to the microsatellite marker Xgwm494, was tentatively designated Stb16q and explained from 41 to 71% of the phenotypic variation at seedling stage and 28-31% in mature plants. The resistance locus on chromosome 5A was specifically expressed in the adult plant stage, associated with SSR marker Xhbg247, explained 12-32% of the variation in disease, was designated Stb17, and is the first unambiguously identified and named QTL for adult plant resistance to M. graminicola. Our results confirm that common wheat progenitors might be a rich source of new Stb resistance genes/QTLs that can be deployed in commercial breeding programs.

AB Allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) Leymus triticoides and Leymus cinereus are divergent perennial grasses, which form fertile hybrids. Genetic maps with n = 14 linkage groups (LG) comprised with 1,583 AFLP and 67 heterologous anchor markers were previously used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in these hybrids, and chromosomes of other Leymus wildryes have been transferred to wheat. However, identifications of the x = 7 homoeologous groups were tenuous and genetic research has been encumbered by a lack of functional, conserved gene marker sequences. Herein, we mapped 350 simple sequence repeats and 26 putative lignin biosynthesis genes from a new Leymus EST library and constructed one integrated consensus map with 799 markers, including 375 AFLPs and 48 heterologous markers, spanning 2,381 centiMorgans. LG1b and LG6b were reassigned as LG6b* and LG1b*, respectively, and LG4Ns and LG4Xm were inverted so that all 14 linkage groups are aligned to the x = 7 Triticeae chromosomes based on EST alignments to barley and other reference genomes. Amplification of 146 mapped Leymus ESTs representing six of the seven homoeologous groups was shown for 17 wheat-Leymus chromosome introgression lines. Reciprocal translocations between 4L and 5L in both Leymus and Triticum monococcum were aligned to the same regions of Brachypodium chromosome 1. A caffeic acid O-methyltransferase locus aligned to fiber QTL peaks on Leymus LG7a and brown midrib mutations of maize and sorghum. Glaucousness genes on Leymus and wheat chromosome 2 were aligned to the same region of Brachypodium chromosome 5. Markers linked to the S self-incompatibility gene on Leymus LG1a cosegregated with markers on LG2b, possibly cross-linked by gametophytic selection. Homoeologous chromosomes 1 and 2 harbor the S and Z gametophytic self-incompatibility genes of Phalaris, Secale, and Lolium, but the Leymus chromosome-2 self-incompatibility gene aligns to a different region on Brachypodium chromosome 5. Nevertheless, cosegregation of self-incompatibility genes on Leymus presents a powerful system for mapping these loci.

AB Kernel hardness or texture, used to classify wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) into soft and hard classes, is a major determinant of milling and baking quality. Wheat genotypes in the soft class that are termed 'extra-soft' (with kernel hardness in the lower end of the spectrum) have been associated with superior end-use quality. In order to better understand the relationship between kernel hardness, milling yield, and various agronomic traits, we performed quantitative trait mapping using a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between a common soft wheat line and a genotype classified as an 'extra-soft' line. A total of 47 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) (LOD >= 3.0) were identified for nine traits with the number of QTL affecting each trait ranging from three to nine. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by these QTL ranged from 3.7 to 50.3%. Six QTL associated with kernel hardness and break flour yield were detected on chromosomes 1BS, 4BS, 5BS, 2DS, 4DS, and 5DL. The two most important QTL were mapped onto orthologous regions on chromosomes 4DS (Xbarc1118-Rht-D1) and 4BS (Xwmc617-Rht-B1). These results indicated that the 'extra-soft' characteristic was not controlled by the Hardness (Ha) locus on chromosome 5DS. QTL for eight agronomic traits occupied two genomic regions near semi-dwarf genes Rht-D1 on chromosome 4DS and Rht-B1 on chromosome 4BS. The clustering of these QTL is either due to the pleiotropic effects of single genes or tight linkage of genes controlling these various traits.

AB Dynamics of cold tolerance and crown proteome composition has been analysed in a set of two winter wheat cultivars Mironovskaya 808 and Bezostaya 1 and four reciprocal substitution lines with interchanged chromosomes 5A and 5B during a long-term cold-acclimation (CA) treatment. Proteome analysis has revealed 298 differently abundant spots during experiment. Most of them (260) were changed due to CA process and only 52 spots displayed differences between genotypes. Two hundred and seven protein spots were successfully identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Comparison of samples before and after vernalization fulfillment by a combination of ANOVA and Student' T-test displayed ten differentially abundant protein spots (e.g. chopper chaperones). However, differences in the accumulation of these spots did not reflect differences in vernalization requirement of genotypes. Therefore, our results indicate that vernalization process has not influenced total proteome of CA wheat crowns. A few protein spots (14 spots; e.g. malate dehydrogenase) revealed differential accumulation levels between the individual genotypes or their groups possessing chromosome 5A or 5B from Mironovskaya 808 versus Bezostaya 1. The study has shown the effect of chromosome 5A on physiological traits and also proteome in winter wheat. Putative candidate protein markers for cold tolerance in wheat are discussed.

AB Cell wall invertase (CWI) is a critical enzyme for sink tissue development and carbon partition, and has a high association with kernel weight. Characterization of Cwi genes and development of functional markers are of importance for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. In the present study, the full-length genomic DNA sequence of a Cwi gene located on wheat chromosome 2A, designated TaCwi-A1, was characterized by in silico cloning and experimental validation. TaCwi-A1 comprises seven exons and six introns, with 3,676 bp in total, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,767 bp. A pair of complementary dominant markers, CWI21 and CWI22, was developed based on allelic variations at the TaCwi-A1 locus. A 404-bp PCR fragment was amplified by CWI21 in varieties with lower kernel weights, whereas a 402-bp fragment was generated by CWI22 in the varieties with higher kernel weights. The markers CWI21 and CWI22 were located on chromosome 2AL using a F(2:3) population from a cross Doumai/Shi 4185, and a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. They were linked to the SSR locus Xbarc15-2AL with a genetic distance of 10.9 cM. QTL analysis indicated that TaCwi-A1 could explain 4.8% of phenotypic variance for kernel weight over 2 years. Two sets of Chinese landraces and two sets of commercial wheat varieties were used to validate the association of CWI21 and CWI22 with kernel weight. The results indicated that the functional markers CWI21 and CWI22 were closely related to kernel weight and could be used in wheat breeding for improving grain yield.

AB In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), crop height is an important determinant of agronomic performance. The aim of this study was to identify genes controlling variation in crop height segregating in elite European winter wheat germplasm. Four doubled haploid populations derived from the crosses Avalon x Cadenza, Savannah x Rialto, Spark x Rialto and Charger x Badger were selected, representing wide diversity in European winter wheat breeding programmes. Genetic maps based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers were constructed for each population. One hundred and four significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified in the four populations. A meta-analysis was conducted and the effects condensed into sixteen meta-QTL on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A (two meta-QTL), 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4B, 4D, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B and 6D. These include QTL with additive effects equivalent to Rht-D1 and a potentially new allele of Rht8. The description of these effects offers new opportunities for the manipulation of crop height, biomass and yield in wheat breeding programmes.

AB To develop chromosome 6D-specific point mutation (PM) markers for alpha-gliadin genes, 79 alpha-gliadin sequences cloned from Aegilops tauschii and another 40 alpha-gliadin genes with known chromosome locations were used in multi-sequence alignment and phylogenic analysis. Additional multiple alignment adjustments were performed manually to facilitate discovery of putative chromosome 6D-specific point mutations. A total of 85 PM primers were designed to detect 68 candidate chromosome 6D-specific point mutations. Experimental tests revealed 11 chromosome 6D-specific PM markers by using genomic DNA from homoeologous group 6 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of Chinese Spring and putative diploid and tetraploid ancestors of hexaploid wheat as PCR templates. Detection of PM markers in one synthetic hexaploid wheat and its parental lines indicated that some alpha-gliadin genes were lost from Gli-2 loci during the formation of hexaploid wheat by amphidiploidization of the genomes of Triticum turgidum and Ae. tauschii. Detection of these PM markers in Ae. tauschii, T. aestivum and its four subspecies indicated that at least two genetically distinct sources of Ae. tauschii contributed germplasm to the D genome of T. aestivum.

AB The genetic basis of stem cell specification in somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis is still obscure. SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes are involved in embryogenesis and organogenesis in numerous species. In vitro culture of Cyclamen persicum immature ovules provides a system for investigating stem cell formation and maintenance, because lines forming either organs or embryos or callus without organs/embryos are available for the same cultivar and plant growth regulator conditions. The present aim was to exploit this property of cyclamen cultures to understand the role of SERK(s) in stem cell formation and maintenance in somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis in vitro, in comparison with expression in planta. CpSERK1 and CpSERK2 were isolated from embryogenic callus. CpSERK1 and CpSERK2 levels by RT-PCR showed that expression is high in embryogenic, moderate in organogenic, and null in recalcitrant calli. in situ hybridizations showed that the expression of both genes started in clumps of pluripotent stem cells, from which both pre-embryogenic aggregates and organ meristemoids derived, and continued in their trans-amplifying, meristem-like, derivatives. Expression declined in organ meristemoids, in parallel with a partial loss of meristematization. In mature somatic embryos, and in shoot and root primordia, CpSERK1 and CpSERK2 were expressed in meristems, and similar patterns occurred in zygotic embryo and primary meristems in planta. The results point to SERK1 and SERK2 as markers of pluripotency in cyclamen. It is proposed that the high expression of these genes in the trans-amplifying derivatives of the stem cells maintains a pluripotent condition leading to totipotency and, consequently, somatic embryogenesis.

TI Registration of a Hard Red Winter Wheat Genetic Stock Homozygous for
   ph1b for Facilitating Alien Introgression for Crop Improvement
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMON WHEAT; MARKER
AB Wild relatives of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are important sources of disease and pest resistance that can be exploited in wheat improvement. However, in wheat-alien species hybrids the pairing homeologous gene, Ph1, suppresses the pairing and recombination of wheat and alien chromosomes and no alien genetic transfer can occur. However, in plants nullisomic for the Ph1 gene, and in ph1b mutant stocks, having a large deletion at the Ph1 locus, homeologous wheat and alien chromosomes can pair and recombine. The original ph1b mutant stock is in Chinese Spring background, which has poor agronomic characteristics, and several backcrosses with adapted wheat cultivars are necessary before the agronomic performance of recombinants can be evaluated. The present report describes the transfer and characterization of the ph1b mutant allele into an adapted Kansas winter wheat, which was released as KS12WGGRC55 (TA5092) (Reg. No. GS-170, PI 663870), which will accelerate the evaluation and utilization of wheat alien recombinants in cultivar improvement.

   Necrotrophic effectors (also known as host-selective toxins) are important determinants of disease in the wheat-Stagonospora nodorum pathosystem. To date, five necrotrophic effector host gene interactions have been identified in this system. Most of these interactions have additive effects while some are epistatic. The Snn4-SnTox4 interaction was originally identified in a recombinant-inbred population derived from a cross between the Swiss winter wheat cultivars 'Arina' and 'Forno' using the S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. Here, we used a recombinant-inbred population consisting of 121 lines developed from a cross between the hexaploid land race Salamouni and the hexaploid wheat 'Katepwa' (SK population). The SK population was used for the construction of linkage maps and quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection using the Swiss S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. The linkage maps developed in the SK population spanned 3,228 centimorgans (cM) and consisted of 441 simple-sequence repeats, 9 restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 29 expressed sequence tag sequence-tagged site markers, and 5 phenotypic markers. The average marker density was 6.7 cM/marker. Two QTL, designated QSub.fcu-1A and QSnb.fcu-7A on chromosome arms 1AS and 7AS, respectively, were associated with disease caused by the S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. The effects of QSnb.fcu-1A were determined by the Snn4-SnTox4 interaction and accounted for 23.5% of the phenotypic variation in this population, whereas QSnb.fcu-7A accounted for 16.4% of the phenotypic variation for disease but was not associated with any known effector sensitivity locus. The effects of both QTL were largely additive and collectively accounted for 35.7% of the total phenotypic variation. The results of this research validate the effects of a compatible Snn4-SnTox4 interaction in a different genetic background, and it provides knowledge regarding genomic regions and molecular markers that can be used to improve Stagonospora nodorum blotch resistance in wheat germplasm.

   Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum sensu strict (s.s.), causes tremendous annual yield losses in wheat worldwide. Variation of aggressiveness of isolates from individual field populations in terms of FHB infection and deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration in the host are important population parameters reflecting parasitic ability. Our main objective was to estimate the variation of both traits within three populations of E graminearum s.s., each consisting of 30 single-spore isolates collected from small wheat fields in Germany, and to compare it with 11 isolates of a collection (E graminearum collection) from four countries. The same isolates were characterized using 19 single-sequence repeat markers. All isolates were spray inoculated on a moderately resistant spring wheat cultivar at two field locations over 2 years (i.e., in four environments). The genotypic proportion of phenotypic variance (sigma(2)(G)) within populations was significant (P < 0.01) for both traits, and the sigma(2)(G) x environment interaction was even more important for mean FHB severity. Ranges in mean FHB severity and DON concentration in the host were only slightly smaller for the field populations than for the E graminearum collection. Both traits were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated within and across populations. A further partitioning of sigma(2)(G) revealed 72% of sigma(2)(G) within and 28% of sigma(2)(G) across populations for both traits. Molecular variance of the three populations was similarly distributed (73.6% within versus 26.4% between populations). In view of this high within-field variation for traits of parasitic ability and selection, neutral molecular markers, multiple resistance genes of different origin should be employed in wheat breeding programs to obtain a long-term stable FHB resistance.

AB Detecting genes that influence biofortification traits in cereal grain could help increase the concentrations of bioavailable mineral elements in crops to solve the global mineral malnutrition problem. The aims of this study were to detect the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations in maize grain in a mapping population, as well as QTLs for bioavailable Fe, Zn, and Mg, by precalculating their respective ratios with P. Elemental analysis of grain samples was done by coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry in 294 F(4) lines of a biparental population taken from field trials of over 3 years. The population was mapped using sets of 121 polymorphic markers. QTL analysis revealed 32 significant QTLs detected for 7 traits, of which some were colocalized. The Additive-dominant model revealed highly significant additive effects, suggesting that biofortification traits in maize are generally controlled by numerous small-effect QTLs. Three QTLs for Fe/P, Zn/P, and Mg/P were colocalized on chromosome 3, coinciding with simple sequence repeats marker bnlg1456, which resides in close proximity to previously identified phytase genes (ZM phys1 and phys2). Thus, we recommend the ratios as bioavailability traits in biofortification research.

AB In support of the international effort to obtain a reference sequence of the bread wheat genome and to provide plant communities dealing with large and complex genomes with a versatile, easy-to-use online automated tool for annotation, we have developed the TriAnnot pipeline. Its modular architecture allows for the annotation and masking of transposable elements, the structural, and functional annotation of protein-coding genes with an evidence-based quality indexing, and the identification of conserved non-coding sequences and molecular markers. The TriAnnot pipeline is parallelized on a 712 CPU computing cluster that can run a 1-Gb sequence annotation in less than 5 days. It is accessible through a web interface for small scale analyses or through a server for large scale annotations. The performance of TriAnnot was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and general fitness using curated reference sequence sets from rice and wheat. In less than 8 h, TriAnnot was able to predict more than 83% of the 3,748 CDS from rice chromosome 1 with a fitness of 67.4%. On a set of 12 reference Mb-sized contigs from wheat chromosome 3B, TriAnnot predicted and annotated 93.3% of the genes among which 54% were perfectly identified in accordance with the reference annotation. It also allowed the curation of 12 genes based on new biological evidences, increasing the percentage of perfect gene prediction to 63%. TriAnnot systematically showed a higher fitness than other annotation pipelines that are not improved for wheat. As it is easily adaptable to the annotation of other plant genomes,TriAnnot should become a useful resource for the annotation of large and complex genomes in the future.

AB The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) gene Lr34/Yr18 conditions resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust, and stem rust, along with other diseases such as powdery mildew. This makes it one of the most important genes in wheat. In Canada, Lr34 has provided effective leaf rust resistance since it was first incorporated into the cultivar Glenlea, registered in 1972. Recently, molecular markers were discovered that are either closely linked to this locus, or contained within the gene. Canadian wheat cultivars released from 1900 to 2007, breeding lines and related parental lines, were tested for sequence based markers caSNP12, caIND11, caIND10, caSNP4, microsatellite markers wms1220, cam11, csLVMS1, swm10, csLV34, and insertion site based polymorphism marker caISBP1. Thirty different molecular marker haplotypes were found among the 375 lines tested; 5 haplotypes had the resistance allele for Lr34, and 25 haplotypes had a susceptibility allele at this locus. The numbers of lines in each haplotype group varied from 1 to 140. The largest group was represented by the leaf rust susceptible cultivar "Thatcher" and many lines derived from "Thatcher". The 5 haplotypes that had the resistance allele for Lr34 were identical for the markers tested within the coding region of the gene but differed in the linked markers wms1220, caISBP1, cam11, and csLV34. The presence of the resistance or susceptibility allele at the Lr34 locus was tracked through the ancestries of the Canadian wheat classes, revealing that the resistance allele was present in many cultivars released since the 1970s, but not generally in the older cultivars.

   ENVIRONMENT; RESISTANCE; PLANTS; EXPRESSION; CULTIVARS
AB Understanding gene flow in genetically modified (GM) crops is critical to answering questions regarding risk-assessment and the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops. In two field experiments, we tested whether rates of cross-pollination differed between GM and non-GM lines of the predominantly self-pollinating wheat Triticum aestivum. In the first experiment, outcrossing was studied within the field by planting "phytometers'' of one line into stands of another line. In the second experiment, outcrossing was studied over distances of 0.5-2.5 m from a central patch of pollen donors to adjacent patches of pollen recipients. Cross-pollination and outcrossing was detected when offspring of a pollen recipient without a particular transgene contained this transgene in heterozygous condition. The GM lines had been produced from the varieties Bobwhite or Frisal and contained Pm3b or chitinase/glucanase transgenes, respectively, in homozygous condition. These transgenes increase plant resistance against pathogenic fungi. Although the overall outcrossing rate in the first experiment was only 3.4%, Bobwhite GM lines containing the Pm3b transgene were six times more likely than non-GM control lines to produce outcrossed offspring. There was additional variation in outcrossing rate among the four GM-lines, presumably due to the different transgene insertion events. Among the pollen donors, the Frisal GM line expressing a chitinase transgene caused more outcrossing than the GM line expressing both a chitinase and a glucanase transgene. In the second experiment, outcrossing after cross-pollination declined from 0.7-0.03% over the test distances of 0.5-2.5 m. Our results suggest that pollen-mediated gene flow between GM and non-GM wheat might only be a concern if it occurs within fields, e.g. due to seed contamination. Methodologically our study demonstrates that outcrossing rates between transgenic and other lines within crops can be assessed using a phytometer approach and that gene-flow distances can be efficiently estimated with population-level PCR analyses.

AB This research was aimed to develop AFLP markers co-segregated with gene Lr24 and validate the using for marker assisted selection (MAS). An F(2) population developed from the cross between the resistant line TcLr24 and the susceptible line Thatcher was tested for resistance to the Puccinia triticina races BGQQ and SHRT using for genetic analysis and molecular marker. A total of 224 AFLP primer combinations were used to test the resistant and susceptible parents, as well as the resistant bulk and the susceptible bulk. Four AFLP markers, P-AGA/M-CTT(289 bp), P-AGC/M-CAC(188) (bp), P-AGC/M-CAC(162) (bp), and P-ACG/M-CGC(239) (bp), were co-segregated with Lr24. The AFLP fragment from the primer combination P-ACG/M-CGC was cloned, sequenced and converted into a STS marker named as ASTS212. Thatcher backgrounded NILs and 115 varieties were examined by using this STS marker and the marker SCS1302(607) developed by Gupta. 5R615, 5R616, 1R13, and 1R17 were identified and validated to contain gene Lr24. The marker is dominant and may be useful in identification the resistance gene Lr24 in wheat and wheat breeding programs.

AB The green-revolution Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfing alleles are usually associated with increased wheat yields but are linked to reduced early growth and poor emergence if sowing conditions are unfavourable. Other dwarfing genes are available but not used in commercial breeding. The Rht13 bread wheat donor, Magnif M1, produces uniquely short peduncle and penultimate internodes to reduce plant height. A set of near-isogenic (NILs) and recombinant inbred (RILs) lines varying for height were developed from the cross of Magnif M1 and the Rht8c-containing Chuan-mai 18, and evaluated for a range of agronomic characteristics across favourable environments. Reductions in plant height were associated with increased grain number (r(2) = 0.35**) and harvest index (r(2) = 0.62**) in the NILs. Reduced-height RILs containing the Rht13-linked, Xgwm577(M) microsatellite marker were significantly shorter, produced greater biomass, yield and harvest index, and increased spike and grain number than lines without the marker. Approximately 74 and 7% of the total phenotypic variance in plant height was accounted for by allelic differences in Xgwm577 and Rht8 loci, respectively. The peduncle and penultimate peduncle internodes of Rht13-containing lines were proportionately shorter than Rht8c-containing sibs and lines containing the Rht-B1b dwarfing allele. The unique height-reducing phenotype, increased grain number and yield associated with Rht13 indicate considerable potential for use of this dwarfing allele for improving wheat performance.

AB Sixty genotypes were evaluated using morphological parameters and molecular markers. Considerable level of variability was observed among the genotypes for chlorophyll content, plant height, spike length and number of plant per meter. Maximum chlorophyll content was observed in genotype SACT-3.2-20-C under irrigated and EGPSN-28 under non-irrigated conditions, while, EGPSN-73 (irrigated) and SACT-2.5-9 (non-irrigated) showed highest density (plants/m(2)). Seeds/ spike and 1000 grain weight were found significantly different in all the 60 genotypes. Genetic diversity based on morphophysiological traits grouped 60 genotypes in to three clusters and the cluster 3 was most distant group none of the genotype showed drought tolerance. Variability observed at morpho-physiological level was further confirmed by RAPD with 20 reproducible primers. RAPD analysis also grouped all 60 genotypes into three clusters except EGPSN-128 which was ungrouped. 64.4% mean similarity was observed among wheat genotypes, was an indication that genotypes have a common gene pool. Genotypes EGPSN73, SACT-3.3-17-A, EGPSN-58, HMN18 and EGPSN-144 were identified drought tolerant.

AB Two cytologically stable wheat-Dasypyrum breviarisatatum addition lines, Y93-1-6-6 and Y93-1-A6-4, were identified by integrated molecular and cytogenetic techniques. C-banding and genomic in sum hybridization (GISH) showed that Y93-1-6-6 and Y93-1-A6-4 were different wheat-D. breviaristatum additions. A total of 51 markers (primer/enzyme combinations), including 6 PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers and 45 Sequence-Tagged-Site (STS) markers, were selected from 3,774 primer/enzyme combinations to further characterize these two additions. Marker haploytpes suggested that both D. breviaristatum chromosomes in Y93-1-6-6 and Y93-1-A6-4 were rearranged. Stem rust resistance screening indicated that both additions were highly resistant to race RKQQC, whereas only Y93-1-6-6 was resistant to race TTKSK (Ug99). Powdery mildew resistance screening showed that only Y93-1-6-6 was resistant. Pedigree analysis suggested that the stem rust and powdery mildew resistance of Y93-1-6-6 was derived from D. breviaristatum, indicating that the D. breviaristatum chromosomes in Y93-1-6-6 possess a new powdery mildew resistance gene(s), and new stem rust resistance gene(s). These two additions could be used as stem rust or powdery mildew resistance sources in wheat breeding programs.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm consisting of 45 genotypes were clustered phenotypically using ten morphological traits and Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) as measure of stripe rust resistance. The clustering was ratified by using twenty three molecular markers (SSR, EST and STS) linked to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistant QTLs. The aim was to asses the extent of genetic variability among the genotypes in order to select the parents for crossing between the resistant and susceptible genotypes with respect to stripe rust. The Euclidian dissimilarity values resulted from phenotypic data regarding morphological traits and AUDPC were used to construct a dendrogram for clustering the accessions. Using un-weighted pair group method with arithmetic means, another dendrogram resulted from the similarity coefficient values was used to distinguish the genotypes with respect to stripe rust. Clustering based on phenotypic data produced two major groups and five clusters (with Euclidian dissimilarity ranging from 2.44 to 16.16) whereas genotypic data yielded two major groups and four clusters (with percent similarity coefficient values ranging from 0.1 to 46.0) to separate the gene pool into highly resistant, resistant, moderately resistant, moderately susceptible and susceptible genotypes. With few exceptions, the outcome of both type of clustering was almost similar and resistant as well as susceptible genotypes came in the same clusters of molecular genotyping as yielded by phenotypic clustering. As a result seven genotypes (Bakhtawar-92, Frontana, Saleem 2000, Tatara, Inqilab-91, Fakhre Sarhad and Karwan) of diverse genetic background were selected for pyramiding stripe rust lesistant genes as well as some other agronomic traits after hybridization.

AB Fusarium asiaticum strains resistant to thiophanate-methyl were detected in four prefectures in Japan though their proportion in the total population was low in all instances. The F167Y or F200Y mutation in the beta 2-tubulin gene (FGSG06611.3) was detected in thiophanate-methyl resistant (TMR) strains. A PCR-based diagnostic method based on these mutations was developed and applied for all 17 TMR strains that have been detected so far in Japan. Three and 14 TMR strains were the F167Y and F200Y mutation types, respectively. Analysis by 11 variable number of tandem repeat markers showed that TMR strains from the same site had an identical genotype, while TMR strains from different sites were dissimilar. This result indicates that TMR strains did not spread clonally to the different sites. (C) 2011 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Powdery mildew of wheat is caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) Speer f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Wheat line Zheng 9754 is resistant in Henan Province. In seedling tests with seven Bgt isolates, Zheng 9754 had a different reaction pattern from those of lines Khapli with Pm4a, Armada with Pm4b, 81-7241 with Pm4c and Lankao 906 with PmLK906. F(1) hybrids, 516 F(2) plants and 327 F(2:3) lines derived from Zheng 9754/Chinese Spring (CS) were used for resistance gene tagging and linkage analysis. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to test the two parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. Subsequently, three polymorphic markers were used for genotyping the F(2) and F(2:3) populations. Powdery mildew resistance in Zheng 9754 was conferred by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated PmHNK54, flanked by SSR markers Xgwm312, Xgwm372 and Xbarc5 on chromosome 2AL. The resistance gene was closely linked to Xbarc5 and Xgwm312, with genetic distances of 5.0 and 6.0 cM, respectively, and located on the chromosome bin 2AL-1-0.85 in the test with a set of deletion lines. The results suggested that PmHNK54 in Zheng 9754 is a new powdery mildew resistance gene in common wheat.

ID WHEAT STRIPE RUST
AB In China, wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat. The Longnan and Linxia regions in Gansu Province and Qinghai Province are the major over-summering regions for the pathogen and key epidemiological zones in Northwest China. Population genetic diversity and interregional long-distance spread of the wheat stripe rust pathogen in Northwest China were studied using SSR markers. The genetic diversity in the Longnan population was much higher than those in the Linxia and Qinghai populations. Therefore, the molecular data confirmed that the Longnan region is a center of genetic diversity for P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in Northwest China. The low genetic differentiation (Gst=0.15) and the extensive gene flow (Nm=1.37) were found among the three regions in Northwest China. The most important conclusion of this study is that the stripe rust inoculum in Qinghai can come from both Longnan and Linxia, but mainly from Longnan directly in the spring.

AB The process of vernalization is mainly controlled by two genes in winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), VRNH1 and VRNH2. A recessive allele at VRNH1 and a dominant allele at VRNH2 must be present to induce a vernalization requirement. In addition, this process is usually associated with greater low-temperature tolerance. Spanish barleys originated in areas with mild winters and display a reduced vernalization requirement compared with standard winter cultivars. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic origin of this reduced vernalization requirement and its effect on frost tolerance. We introgressed the regions of a typical Spanish barley line that carry VRNH1 and VRNH2 into a winter cultivar, Plaisant, using marker-assisted backcrossing. We present the results of a set of 12 lines introgressed with all four possible combinations of VRNH1 and VRNH2, which were evaluated for vernalization requirement and frost tolerance. The reduced vernalization requirement of the Spanish parent was confirmed, and was found to be due completely to the effect of the VRNH1 region. The backcross lines showed no decline in frost tolerance compared with that of the recurrent parent unless they carried an extra segment of chromosome 5H. This extra segment, a carryover of the backcross process, apparently contained the well-known frost tolerance quantitative trait locus Fr-H2. We demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate the vernalization requirement with only minor effects on frost tolerance. This finding opens the path to creating new types of barley cultivars that are better suited to specific environments, especially in a climate-change scenario.

AB Breeding for fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance of wheat is a continuous challenge for plant breeders. Resistance to FHB is a quantitative trait, governed by several to many genes and modulated by environmental conditions. The presented study was undertaken to assess the effect on improving FHB resistance and on possible unwanted side effects ('linkage drag') of two resistance QTL, namely Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A, from the spring wheat line CM-82036 when transferred by marker-assisted backcrossing into several European winter wheat lines. To achieve these goals, we developed and evaluated fifteen backcross-two-derived families based on nine European winter wheat varieties as recipients and the FHB resistant variety CM-82036 as resistance donor. The QTL Qfhs.ifa-5A had a relatively small impact on increasing FHB resistance. On average lines with Fhb1 plus Qfhs.ifa-5A combined were only slightly more resistant compared to lines with Fhb1 alone. The obtained results suggest that the effect of the spring wheat-derived QTL on improving FHB resistance increases in the order Qfhs.ifa-5A < Fhb1 a parts per thousand currency sign Qfhs.ifa-5A plus Fhb1 combined. The genetic background of the recipient line had a large impact on the resistance level of the obtained lines. No systematic negative effect of the spring wheat-derived QTL on grain yield, thousand grain weight, hectoliter weight and protein content was found. The use of spring wheat-derived FHB resistance QTL for breeding high yielding cultivars with improved FHB resistance appears therefore highly promising.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most widespread diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) globally. With the objective of identifying and mapping new genes for resistance to leaf rust, F(1), F(2) plants and F(3) lines from a cross between resistant cultivar Bimai 16 and susceptible cultivar Thatcher were inoculated with Chinese Puccinia triticina pathotypes FHTT and PHTS in the greenhouse. In the first seedling test, Bimai 16, Thatcher, 20 F(1) plants, 359 F(2) plants and 298 F(3) lines were inoculated with pathotype FHTT. A set of 1,255 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs were used to test the parents, and resistant and susceptible bulks. Seven polymorphic markers on chromosome 7BL were used for genotyping the F(2) and F(3) populations. The results indicated that Bimai 16 carried a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated LrBi16, closely linked to SSR markers Xcfa2257 and Xgwm344, with genetic distances of 2.8 and 2.9 cM, respectively. In the second seedling test, two dominant resistance genes were identified in Bimai 16 based on seedling reactions of 254 F(2) plants inoculated with pathotype PHTS. One of the genes was LrBi16, and the other was likely to be LrZH84, which is located in chromosome 1BL. The seedling reaction pattern of plants with LrBi16 was different from that of the Thatcher lines, with Lr14a and Lr14b located on chromosome 7BL. It was concluded that LrBi16 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene.

AB Annual canarygrass, commonly known as canary seed (Phalaris canariensis L.), is a self-pollinated diploid cereal (2n = 12) with a genome size of 3,800 Mbp. Canary seed is presently used for bird-feed with a potential to develop it for human consumption. Marker-assisted selection can be used to accelerate breeding of new canary seed cultivars. Microsatellites or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers generally show a high degree of polymorphism in different plant genera. FIASCO (Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences COntaining repeats) was used to generate microsatellite markers specific for canary seed. An enriched SSR (AG)(17) library derived from DNA isolated from a canary seed cultivar (CDC Togo) was produced. Analysis and DNA sequencing of the library resulted in 744 clones from which 132 primer pairs were designed. Seventy-eight functional markers amplified unique products from canary seed DNA. These SSR markers revealed the biodiversity among a panel of 48 canary seed accessions. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values of 37 polymorphic microsatellites ranged from 0.08 to 0.73 with an average of 0.36.

AB Dietary deficiency of iron and zinc micronutrients affects more than two billion people worldwide. Breeding for micronutrient-dense crops is the most sustainable and cost-effective approach for alleviation of micronutrient malnutrition. Three accessions of Aegilops peregrina (Hack.) Maire & Weill (2n = 28, U(P)U(P)S(P)S(P)), selected for high grain iron and zinc concentration were crossed with Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring (Ph (I) ). The sterile F(1) hybrids were backcrossed with elite wheat cultivars to get fertile BC(2)F(2) derivatives. Some of the fertile BC(2)F(2) derivatives showed nearly 100% increase in grain iron and more than 200% increase in grain zinc concentration compared to the recipient wheat cultivars. The development of derivatives with significantly higher grain micronutrients, high thousand-grain weight and harvest index suggests that the enhanced micronutrient concentration is due to the distinct genetic system of Ae. peregrina and not to the concentration effect. Genomic in situ hybridization, comparison of introgressed chromosomes with the standard karyotype of Ae. peregrina and simple sequence repeat marker analysis revealed the introgression of 7S(P) chromosomes in five selected derivatives, 7U(P) in four, group 4 and 4S(P) in three and a translocated 5U(P) of Ae. peregrina in one of the selected derivatives. Molecular marker analysis using the introgressed chromosome markers indicated that two of the BC(2)F(3) progenies were stabilized as disomic addition lines. It could, therefore, be concluded that the group 4 and 7 chromosomes of Ae. peregrina carry the genes for high grain iron and zinc concentration.

AB Resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) is of great importance in wheat breeding programs in the northern hemisphere. In Europe, breeders prefer adapted germplasm as resistance donor because of high grain yield and quality demands. Our objective was to identify chromosomal regions affecting FHB resistance among 455 European soft winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines using a genome-wide association mapping approach and to analyze the importance of epistatic interactions. All entries were evaluated for FHB resistance by inoculation in two environments and several ratings. Wheat was genotyped by 115 simple sequence repeat markers randomly distributed across the genome and two allele-specific markers for Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 genes. The genome-wide scan revealed nine significant (P < 0.05) marker-phenotype associations on seven chromosomes including dwarfing gene Rht-D1. Using a Bonferroni-Holm correction, three significant associations remained on chromosomes 1B, 1D, and 2D. The proportion of the genotypic variance explained simultaneously by individual markers was 36% and increased to 50% when two digenic epistatic interactions were considered, one of them associated with Rht-B1. In conclusion, new genomic regions on chromosomes 1D and 3A could be found for FHB resistance in European wheat and the effect of epistatic interactions was substantial.

AB Adult plant resistance (APR) is considered potentially more durable for controlling barley leaf rust than seedling Rph (Resistance to Puccinia hordei) genes. A major gene for adult plant resistance to barley leaf rust has been mapped to the telomere region of chromosome 5HS. PCR-based molecular markers were developed for saturation of this region based on previously mapped simple sequence repeat, restriction fragment length polymorphism and Diversity Arrays Technology markers. In addition, defence gene homologue (DGH) and wheat expressed sequence tags mapped in specific bins were used to develop new PCR markers. Seventeen PCR-based markers were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5H in 292 doubled haploid lines from a cross of Pompadour x Stirling, in which seven markers were mapped within 5 cM of the APR gene. The closest linked marker was about 0.7 cM from the APR gene. The wheat deletion bin map together with defence gene homologues was demonstrated to be an efficient tool for development of new molecular markers associated with the disease resistance gene. Four DGH markers were associated with the APR gene. The new molecular markers are a useful tool for marker-assisted selection of the APR gene and provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanism for leaf rust resistance.

AB The short arm of rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome 1 (1RS), besides being part of the rye genome, is present in many hundred wheat cultivars as either 1RS.1BL or 1RS.1DL wheat-rye translocation. In this study, the distribution of the wheat-rye translocation was examined in 33 Iranian winter and spring wheat cultivars, nine of which had a known donor of 1RS.1BL translocation and the other 24 were randomly selected cultivars without a known source of 1RS.1BL in their pedigree. The presence of the translocation was verified in 4 cultivars, using genomic in situ hybridization analysis. We also compared the Na(+) exclusion and K(+)/Na(+) ratios in leaf and root of the identified 1RS.1BL translocations and in eight randomly selected non-translocated (NT) control cultivars grown in hydroponic solutions, containing 0 and 200 mM NaCl. Mean comparisons showed that the 1RS.1BL cultivars (Atrak, Dez, Falat, Rasul) had significantly lower rates of whole plant dry weight and root dry weight in the presence of 200 mM NaCl compared with NT control cultivars. No significant difference was observed between translocated and NT cultivars for Na(+) concentrations and K(+)/Na(+) ratios in their leaves or roots. Although, there are many useful genes in 1RS arm, it has no substantial contribution to Na(+) exclusion in comparison with NT controls at seedling stage.

AB The recent emergence of wheat stem rust Ug99 and evolution of new races within the lineage threatens global wheat production because they overcome widely deployed stem rust resistance (Sr) genes that had been effective for many years. To identify loci conferring adult plant resistance to races of Ug99 in wheat, we employed an association mapping approach for 276 current spring wheat breeding lines from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding lines were genotyped with Diversity Array Technology (DArT) and microsatellite markers. Phenotypic data was collected on these lines for stem rust race Ug99 resistance at the adult plant stage in the stem rust resistance screening nursery in Njoro, Kenya in seasons 2008, 2009 and 2010. Fifteen marker loci were found to be significantly associated with stem rust resistance. Several markers appeared to be linked to known Sr genes, while other significant markers were located in chromosome regions where no Sr genes have been previously reported. Most of these new loci colocalized with QTLs identified recently in different biparental populations. Using the same data and Q + K covariate matrices, we investigated the interactions among marker loci using linear regression models to calculate P values for pairwise marker interactions. Resistance marker loci including the Sr2 locus on 3BS and the wPt1859 locus on 7DL had significant interaction effects with other loci in the same chromosome arm and with markers on chromosome 6B. Other resistance marker loci had significant pairwise interactions with markers on different chromosomes. Based on these results, we propose that a complex network of gene-gene interactions is, in part, responsible for resistance to Ug99. Further investigation may provide insight for understanding mechanisms that contribute to this resistance gene network.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of soft red winter wheat in the eastern region of the USA. Pioneer 26R61 has provided effective resistance to stripe rust for 10 years. To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, a mapping population of 178 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed using single-seed descent from a cross between Pioneer 26R61 and the susceptible cultivar AGS 2000. A genetic map with 895 markers covering all 21 chromosomes was used for QTL analysis. One major QTL was detected, explaining up to 56.0% of the mean phenotypic variation, flanked by markers Xbarc124 and Xgwm359, and assigned to the distal 22% of the short arm of wheat chromosome 2A. Evidence showed that it was different from Yr17 derived from Ae. ventricosa, the only formally named Yr gene in 2AS, and the QTL was temporarily designated as YrR61. In addition, a minor QTL, QYr.uga-6AS, probably conditioned high-temperature adult plant resistance. The QTL explained 6-7% of the trait variation. Preliminary test of the flanking markers for YrR61, in two cultivars and two promising breeding lines with Pioneer 26R61 in their pedigree, indicated that YrR61 was present in these cultivars and lines, and these markers could therefore be used in marker-assisted selection.

AB A protocol for biolistic transformation of bread wheat based on using mature seed tissues as explants has been developed. Embryogenic callus obtained from mature seed tissues was transformed with a psGFP-BAR plasmid containing gfp reporter gene and bar selectable marker gene. The influence of hormone composition of the medium on the efficiency of transformation of mature wheat seed tissues has been demonstrated. The use of auxin 2,4-D resulted in the formation of transgenic plants with a frequency of 0.75%, while the use of Dicamba auxin for the regeneration of plants did not result in transformant development. The transgenic status of the plants obtained in the experiments has been confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR. Stable inheritance of transgenic features in the following generations of wheat (T(1), T(2)) has been demonstrated and transgenic plants exhibiting high resistance to herbicides have been obtained. The protocol developed allows for a simplified transformation of wheat in order to obtain transgenic plants with novel features.

AB This study evaluates the potential of flow cytometry for chromosome sorting in two wild diploid wheats Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. comosa and their natural allotetraploid hybrids Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata. Flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and content of chromosome peaks was determined. Peaks of chromosome 1U could be discriminated in flow karyotypes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. biuncialis and the chromosome could be sorted with purities exceeding 95%. The remaining chromosomes formed composite peaks and could be sorted in groups of two to four. Twenty four wheat SSR markers were tested for their position on chromosomes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. comosa using PCR on DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA of wheat-Ae. geniculata addition lines, respectively. Six SSR markers were located on particular Aegilops chromosomes using sorted chromosomes, thus confirming the usefulness of this approach for physical mapping. The SSR markers are suitable for marker assisted selection of wheat-Aegilops introgression lines. The results obtained in this work provide new opportunities for dissecting genomes of wild relatives of wheat with the aim to assist in alien gene transfer and discovery of novel genes for wheat improvement.

AB Backcross lines of high yielding cultivar HD2687 developed earlier carrying leaf rust resistance genes Lr19 and Lr28 were utilized to pyramid the two genes using marker assisted selection. Background analysis using 602 SSR markers was done to compare the genotypic background of backcrossed lines with recipient variety HD2687 as well as the donor genotypes Cook*6/C80-1 and CS2A/2M#4/2. Backcross lines of HD2687 with Lr19 and Lr28 i.e. HD2687+Lr19 and HD2687+ Lr28 showed 89 and 92.1 percent genomic similarity with HD2687. The two backcross lines were crossed and plants carrying both Lr19 and Lr28 were identified in F-2 generation. Background analysis of 51 plants carrying both Lr19 and Lr28 was undertaken using polymorphic SSR markers to Identify plants with better recovery of HD2687 background. Although, Lr19 and Lr28 individually are ineffective against leaf rust pathotypes 77-8 and 77-10 but pyramided lines are expected to provide resistance against all the races.

AB One hundred and eighty-two bread wheat cultivars developed in India were characterized for low molecular weight (LMW) glutenins using SOS-PAGE and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess allelic diversity encoded by Glu-3 loci, as well as their utility for correctly identifying different alleles. SDS-PAGE indicated Glu-A3c is present in 64.6% of the cultivars, Glu-A3b in 13.8%, Glu-A3d in 12.7% and Glu-A3e/f in 8.8%. Seven types of alleles were present at the Glu-B3 locus: Glu-B3b (29.3%), Glu-B3g (27.0%), GIu-83h (13.8%), Glu-B3i (16.1%), Glu-B3j (12.1%), Glu-B3c (0.6%) and Glu-B3d (1.1%). SDS-PAGE found three types of Glu-D3 alleles: Glu-D3a (30.2%), Glu-D3b (67.1%) and Glu-D3c (2.7%). However, PCR found two different alleles in cultivars classified as carrying Glu-D3a and three alleles in those identified as carrying Glu-D3b cultivars, indicating a more complex nature of the Glu-D3 locus. In conclusion, the data found greater consistency between the SDS-PAGE and PCR amplification patterns of alleles such as Glu-A3c, Glu-A3d, Glu-B3g, Glu-B3h and Glu-B3i, and less consistency between those same patterns in the Glu-A3b, Glu-A3e/f and Glu-B3b alleles. More studies are needed in order to achieve unambiguous identification of the Glu-3 alleles and thereby allow their greater utility in germplasm evaluation and breeding. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over two billion people, depending largely on staple foods, suffer from deficiencies in protein and some micronutrients such as iron and zinc. Among various approaches to overcome protein and micronutrient deficiencies, biofortification through a combination of conventional and molecular breeding methods is the most feasible, cheapest, and sustainable approach. An interspecific cross was made between the wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring' and Aegilops kotschyi Boiss. accession 396, which has a threefold higher grain iron and zinc concentrations and about 33% higher protein concentration than wheat cultivars. Recurrent backcrossing and selection for the micronutrient content was performed at each generation. Thirteen derivatives with high grain iron and zinc concentrations and contents, ash and ash micronutrients, and protein were analyzed for alien introgression. Morphological markers, high molecular weight glutenin subunit profiles, anchored wheat microsatellite markers, and GISH showed that addition and substitution of homoeologous groups 1, 2, and 7 chromosomes of Ae. kotschyi possess gene(s) for high grain micronutrients. The addition of 1U/1S had high molecular weight glutenin subunits with higher molecular weight than those of wheat, and the addition of 2S in most of the derivatives also enhanced grain protein content by over 20%. Low grain protein content in a derivative with a 2S-wheat translocation, waxy leaves, and absence of the gdm148 marker strongly suggests that the gene for higher grain protein content on chromosome 2S is orthologous to the grain protein QTL on the short arm of group 2 chromosomes.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici, and powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, are the most prevalent of all of the wheat diseases in many regions of the world including Poland. These two diseases can cause serious epidemics in Poland. The aim of presented research was pyramiding of leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance genes in a one genotype. A leaf rust resistance gene Lr41, derived from Triticum tauschii (syn. Aegilops squarrosa) and powdery mildew resistance gene, derived from Dasypyrum villosum (syn. Haynaldia villosa), were successfully transferred into the polish winter wheat variety. A line KS90WGRC10 was used as the resistance source of Lr41 for leaf rust and the 6VS/6AL translocation line Yangmai 5 was used as the resistance source of Pm21 for powdery mildew. In foreground selection several molecular markers for Lr41 (Gdm35, Barc124, Gwm261, Gwm296 and Gwm210) and Pm21 (SCAR(1250), SCAR(1400) and NAU/xibao) were applied. After the first backcrosses (BC1F1), background selection was conducted using a set of 5 AFLP primer combinations. In addition, for the screening of the BC(1)F(2) and BC(1)F(3) population, selected lines were inoculated in the greenhouse at the three-leaf stage with a natural pathogen population of P. recondita and B. graminis. The marker-assisted selection and pathology test allowed us to obtain homozygous lines carrying two resistance genes to leaf rust and powdery mildew in winter wheat.

AB Greenhouse seedling rust tests of the 35(th) International Bread Wheat Screening Nursery (IBWSN), distributed by the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre in 2002, demonstrated that 290 (58%) of the 500 entries likely carried the 1RS.1BL translocation, and therefore the rust resistance genes Lr26, Yr9 and Sr31. A selection of 109 lines identified as carrying this translocation was postulated to carry the major seedling resistance genes Lr3a, Lr13, Lr16, Lr19, Lr23, Lr24 and Lr27+Lr31 in addition to Lr26. The leaf rust seedling genes Lr13, Lr16 and Lr27+Lr31, were the most common seedling resistance genes in a selection of 100 lines lacking the 1RS.1BL translocation. While no new sources of seedling resistance to leaf rust were found in this study, and virulence is known for all of the seedling genes identified, 46 lines were identified that dispayed moderately high to very high levels of adult plant resistence (APR) to leaf rust in the field over 2 years that could be very useful in developing new wheat cultivars with resistance to Puccinia triticina. Of these, 24 were shown to carry Lr34, and based on pedigree analysis, it is expected that the APR gene Lr46 is also present in at least some lines. Genetic studies are needed to characterize the APR in these lines to assess their full value as sources of new leaf rust resistance.

AB Ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro) belongs to Dendrocalamus genus, Bambusease tribe, Bambusoideae subfamily, Poaceae family. It is a representative species of clumping bamboo, and a principal commercial species for various construction purposes using mature culms and for human consumption using young shoots. A normalized cDNA library was constructed from young leaves of Ma bamboo and 9,574 high-quality ESTs were generated, from which 5,317 unigenes including 1,502 contigs and 3,815 singletons were assembled. The unigenes were assigned into different gene ontology (GO) categories and summarized into 13 broad biologically functional groups according to similar functional characteristics or cellular roles by BLAST search against public databases. Eight hundred and ninety-one unigenes were assigned by KO identifiers and mapped to six KEGG biochemical pathways. The transcripts involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as cytochrome 450, flavonol synthase/flavanone 3-hydroxylase, and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase were well represented by 14 unigenes in the unigene set. The candidate genes involved in phytohormone metabolism, signal transduction and encoding cell wall-associated receptor kinases were also identified. Sixty-seven unigenes related to plant resistance (R) genes, including RPP genes, RGAs and RDL/RF genes, were discovered. These results will provide genome-wide knowledge about the molecular physiology of Ma bamboo young leaves and tools for advanced studies of molecular mechanism underlying leaf growth and development.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most serious wheat diseases. The rapid evolution of the pathogen's virulence, due to the heavy use of resistance genes, necessitates the expansion of resistance gene diversity. The common wheat line D57 is highly resistant to powdery mildew. A genetic analysis using an F(2) population derived from the cross of D57 with the susceptible cultivar Yangmai 158 and the derived F(2:3) lines indicated that D57 carries two dominant powdery mildew resistance genes. Based on mapping information of polymorphic markers identified by bulk segregant analysis, these two genes were assigned to chromosomes 5DS and 6DS. Using the F(2:3) lines that segregated in a single-gene mode, closely linked PCR-based markers were identified for both genes, and their chromosome assignments were confirmed through linkage mapping. The gene on chromosome 5DS was flanked by Xgwm205 and Xmag6176, with a genetic distance of 8.3 cM and 2.8 cM, respectively. This gene was 3.3 cM from a locus mapped by the STS marker MAG6137, converted from the RFLP marker BCD1871, which was 3.5 cM from Pm2. An evaluation with 15 pathogen isolates indicated that this gene and Pm2 were similar in their resistance spectra. The gene on chromosome 6DS was flanked by co-segregating Xcfd80 and Xmag6139 on one side and Xmag6140 on the other, with a genetic distance of 0.7 cM and 2.7 cM, respectively. This is the first powdery mildew resistance gene identified on chromosome 6DS, and plants that carried this gene were highly resistant to all of the 15 tested pathogen isolates. This gene was designated Pm45. The new resistance gene in D57 could easily be transferred to elite cultivars due to its common wheat origin and the availability of closely linked molecular markers.

AB Nutritional benefits of cultivated oat (Avena sativa L., 2n = 6x = 42, AACCDD) are well recognized; however, seed protein levels are modest and resources for genetic improvement are scarce. The wild tetraploid, A. magna Murphy et Terrell (syn A. maroccana Gdgr., 2n = 4x = 28, CCDD), which contains approximately 31% seed protein, was hybridized with cultivated oat to produce a domesticated A. magna. Wild and cultivated accessions were crossed to generate a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Although these materials could be used to develop domesticated, high-protein oat, mapping and quantitative trait loci introgression is hindered by a near absence of genetic markers. Objectives of this study were to develop high-throughput, A. magna-specific markers; generate a genetic linkage map based on the A. magna RIL population; and map genes controlling oat domestication. A Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) array derived from 10 A. magna genotypes was used to generate 2,688 genome-specific probes. These, with 12,672 additional oat clones, produced 2,349 polymorphic markers, including 498 (21.2%) from A. magna arrays and 1,851 (78.8%) from other Avena libraries. Linkage analysis included 974 DArT markers, 26 microsatellites, 13 SNPs, and 4 phenotypic markers, and resulted in a 14-linkage-group map. Marker-to-marker correlation coefficient analysis allowed classification of shared markers as unique or redundant, and putative linkage-group-to-genome anchoring. Results of this study provide for the first time a collection of high-throughput tetraploid oat markers and a comprehensive map of the genome, providing insights to the genome ancestry of oat and affording a resource for study of oat domestication, gene transfer, and comparative genomics.

AB An integrated consensus linkage map is proposed for globe artichoke. Maternal and paternal genetic maps were constructed on the basis of an F(1) progeny derived from crossing an artichoke genotype (Mola) with its progenitor, the wild cardoon (Tolfa), using EST-derived SSRs, genomic SSRs, AFLPs, ten genes, and two morphological traits. For most genes, mainly belonging to the chlorogenic acid pathway, new markers were developed. Five of these were SNP markers analyzed through high-resolution melt technology. From the maternal (Mola) and paternal (Tolfa) maps, an integrated map was obtained, containing 337 molecular and one morphological markers ordered in 17 linkage groups (LGs), linked between Mola and Tolfa. The integrated map covers 1,488.8 cM, with an average distance of 4.4 cM between markers. The map was aligned with already existing maps for artichoke, and 12 LGs were linked via 31 bridge markers. LG numbering has been proposed. A total of 124 EST-SSRs and two genes were mapped here for the first time, providing a framework for the construction of a functional map in artichoke. The establishment of a consensus map represents a necessary condition to plan a complete sequencing of the globe artichoke genome.

AB Drought as a major abiotic stress often occurs from stem elongation to the grain filling stage of wheat in northern China. Plant height (PH) is a suitable trait to model the dissection of drought tolerance. The purposes of the present study were to validate molecular markers for PH developmental behavior and identify elite alleles of molecular markers. After the phenotyping of 154 accessions for PH dynamic development under well-watered (WW) and drought stressed (DS) conditions, and the genotyping of 60 SSR markers from six candidate chromosome regions related to PH found in our previous linkage mapping studies, both parameters PH and drought tolerance coefficient (DTC) calculated by the conditional analysis were used for association mapping. A total of 46 significant association signals (P < 0.01) were identified in 23 markers, and phenotypic variation ranged from 7 to 50%. Among them, four markers Xgwm261-2D, Xgwm495-4B, Xbarc109-4B and Xcfd23-4D were detected under both water regimes. Furthermore, 10 markers were associated with DTC, and four with both parameters PH and DTC at the same plant development stage. The results revealed different allelic effects of associated markers; for example, the 155 bp Xgwm495-4B allele was associated with a reduced height of -11.2 cm under DS and -15.3 cm under WW, whereas the 167 bp allele exhibited increased height effects of 3.9 and 8.1 cm, respectively. This study demonstrates a strong power of joint association analysis and linkage mapping for the identification of important genes in wheat.

AB Utilization of a two-line breeding system via photoperiod-thermo sensitive male sterility has a great potential for hybrid production in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). 337S is a novel wheat male sterile line sensitive to both short daylength/low temperature and long daylength/high temperature. Five F(2) populations derived from the crosses between 337S and five common wheat varieties were developed for genetic analysis. All F(1)'s were highly fertile while segregation occurred in the F(2) populations with a ratio of 3 fertile:1 sterile under short daylength/low temperature. It is shown that male sterility in 337S was controlled by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated as wptms3. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) coupled with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was applied to map the sterile gene using one mapping population. The wptms3 gene was mapped to chromosome arm 1BS and flanked by Xgwm413 and Xgwm182 at a genetic distance of 3.2 and 23.5 cM, respectively. The accuracy and efficiency of marker-assisted selection were evaluated and proved essential for identifying homozygous recessive male sterile genotypes of the wptms3 gene in F(2) generation.

AB Dynamics of chromosomal ends during meiosis was examined using a tetrad F(1) population derived from a cross between Setaria and Triticum isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae. Telomeric fragments were liberated by six restriction enzymes and detected with a telomere probe. Each fragment was assigned to one of the 14 chromosomal ends using chromosome-specific markers. Size shifts and non-Mendelian segregation (4:0, 3:1, 1:3, and 0:4) were frequently observed in these telomeric fragments and were considered to be caused by deletion, insertion, point mutation, and gene conversion. Similar results were obtained in another tetrad F(1) population derived from a cross between Oryza and Triticum isolates. These results suggest that subtelomeric regions are unstable during meiosis and are prone to various rearrangements including gene conversion.

AB Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) is a significant disease in some wheat-growing regions of the world. Resistance in wheat to Stagonospora nodorum is complex, whereby genes for seedling, flag leaf, and glume resistance are independent. The aims of this study were to identify alternative genes for flag leaf resistance, to compare and contrast with known quantitative trait loci (QTL) for SNB resistance, and to determine the potential role of host-specific toxins for SNB QTL. Novel QTL for flag leaf resistance were identified on chromosome 2AS inherited from winter wheat parent 'P92201D5' and chromosome IBS from spring wheat parent 'EGA Blanco'. The chromosomal map position of markers associated with QTL on IBS and 2AS indicated that they were unlikely to be associated with known host toxin insensitivity loci. A QTL on chromosome 5BL inherited from EGA Blanco had highly significant association with markers fcp001 and fcp620 based on disease evaluation in 2007 and, therefore, is likely to be associated with Tsnl-ToxA insensitivity for flag leaf resistance. However, fcp001 and fcp620 were not associated with a QTL detected based on disease evaluation in 2008, indicating two linked QTL for flag leaf resistance with multiple genes residing on 5BL. This study identified novel QTL and their effects in controlling flag leaf SNB resistance.

AB Soilborne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) is one of the most important winter wheat pathogens worldwide. To identify genes for resistance to the virus in U.S. winter wheat, association study was conducted using a selected panel of 205 elite experimental lines and cultivars from U.S. hard and soft winter wheat breeding programs. Virus symptoms were evaluated twice in virus-infected fields for the panel at Manhattan, KS in spring 2010 and 2011 and for a subpanel of 137 hard winter wheat accessions at Stillwater. OK in spring 2008. At the two locations, 69.8 and 79.5% of cultivars were resistant or moderately resistant to the disease, respectively. After 282 simple-sequence repeat markers covering all wheat chromosome arms were scanned for association in the panel, marker Xgwm469 on the long arm of chromosome 5D (5DL) showed a significant association with the disease rating. Three alleles (Xgwm469-165bp, -167bp, and -169bp) were associated with resistance and the null allele was associated with susceptibility. Correlations between the marker and the disease rating were highly significant (0.80 in Manhattan at P < 0.0001 and 0.63 in Stillwater at P < 0.0001). The alleles Xgwm469-165bp and Xgwm469-169bp were present mainly in the hard winter wheat group, whereas allele Xgwm469-167hp was predominant in the soft winter wheat. The 169 bp allele can be traced back to 'Newton', and the 165 bp allele to Aegilops tauschii. In addition, a novel locus on the short arm of chromosome 4D (4DS) was also identified to associate with the disease rating. Marker Xgwm469-5DL is closely linked to SBWMV resistance and highly polymorphic across the winter wheat accessions sampled in the study and, thus, should be useful in marker-assisted selection in U.S. winter wheat.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Host resistance is the best way to control the disease. Genetic analysis of F-2 and F-2:3 populations from an Avocet S/Jimai 22 cross indicated that stripe rust resistance in Jimai 22 was conferred by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated YrJ22. A total of 377 F-2 plants and 127 F-2:3 lines were tested with Chinese Pst race CYR32 and genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A linkage map was constructed with five SSR and two SNP markers. Xwmc658 and IWA1348 flanked YrJ22 at genetic distances of 1.0 and 7.3 cM, proximally and distally, respectively. The chromosomal location was confirmed using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic, ditelosomics and deletion lines. Seedling reactions to 21 Pst races demonstrated differences in specificity between YrJ22 and other resistance genes on chromosome 2AL, indicating that YrJ22 is likely to be a new wheat stripe rust resistance gene.

AB A mapping population of 126 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from a cross between the English winter wheat cultivars Spark and Rialto was evaluated for response to Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici in the greenhouse and in artificially inoculated field plots at two locations over 3 years (2011, 2012 and 2013). Genetic analysis indicated the involvement of two seedling genes (Sr5 and Sr31, contributed by Rialto) and three adult plant resistance genes. QTL analyses of field data showed the involvement of three consistent effects QTL on chromosome arms 1BS (contributed by Rialto), and 3BS and chromosome 5A (contributed by Spark) in the observed resistance to stem rust. These QTLs explained average phenotypic variation of 78.5, 9.0 and 5.9 %, respectively. With the presence of virulence for Sr5 and absence of Sr31 virulence in the field, the QTL detected on 1BS (QSr.sun-1BS) was attributed to the major seedling resistance gene Sr31. The QTL located on chromosome arm 3BS (QSr.sun-3BS) was closely associated with SSR marker gwm1034, and the QTL detected on 5A (QSr.sun-5A) was closely linked with SSR marker gwm443. DH lines carrying the combination of QSr.sun-3BS and QSr. sun-5A exhibited lower stem rust responses indicating the additive effects of the two APR genes in reducing disease severity. The markers identified in this study can be useful in pyramiding these QTLs with other major or minor genes and marker assisted selection for stem rust resistance in wheat.

AB Drought is one of the most limiting factors for plant growth and development. In this study, experiments were carried out on five tomato rootstocks were subjected to water withdrawal and re-watering. Two RKN (root-knot nematodes)-and drought-dual resistant rootstocks were identified according to phenotype, physiological and molecular indexes such as the leaf relative water content (LRWC), electrolyte leakage (EL), water loss of the leaf, proline content, and increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, including peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and the transcript levels of drought stress marker genes. Further, we preliminarily investigated the mechanism underlying improved drought tolerance arising from grafting. These results will promote the application of these rootstocks in tomato production and provide new information on the mechanism of tomato grafting.

AB In an attempt to transfer the Lr56/Yr38 resistance loci from Aegilops sharonensis to wheat, a 6A-6S(sh) chromosome translocation was produced. It involves essentially the entire chromosome 6S(sh) with a small terminal segment of 6AL. Induced homoeologous recombination of the translocated chromosome with 6A produced numerous recombinants including three recombined chromosomes carrying Lr56 that could not be precisely mapped for lack of suitable markers. This study aimed to determine the chromosomal locations of the translocation breakpoints in these three recombinants using various DNA markers as well as physical and genetic mapping. The three recombinants Lr56-39, -157 and -175 carry small segments of Ae.sharonensis chromatin distally to the Xgpw4329 and IWA5416 loci near the 6AS telomere. The Ae.sharonensis chromatin that remains in each line includes a homoeolocus of the wheat marker locus Xdupw217 (on 6BS) and its characteristic amplification product can be used as a dominant marker for the presence of Lr56. Of the three recombined chromosomes, Lr56-157 retained the least alien chromatin and appears to be the best candidate for use in wheat breeding.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat worldwide, especially in China. Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective approach to control the disease, but few effective resistance genes are available. Guinong 22, one of the wheat cultivars used for differentiated Chinese race of the pathogen, has unknown resistance gene(s) to stripe rust. Genetic analysis, molecular mapping and allelic analysis were used in this study to determine the inheritance and chromosomal location of the gene(s) in Guinong 22 with the most prevalent Pst race CYR33. Genetic analysis indicated that a single recessive gene yrGn22 confers the resistance to CYR33. A total of 450 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs and 31 pairs of sequence-tagged site (STS) or conserved primers were selected to screen the resistant bulk and susceptible bulk as well as the parents. Seven polymorphic SSR markers and two STS markers were then used to genotype 113F(2) individual plants. Linkage analysis indicated that all nine markers were linked to yrGn22, with genetic distances ranging from 2.2 to 11.1cM. Based on thechromosomal locations of the linked markers, yrGn22 was located onwheat chromosome 1B near the centromere. The pedigree, common markers, chromosome location, resistance and allelism tests indicated that yrGn22 is either linked to Yr26 or possiblythe same gene.

AB Exploitation of host resistance is important for controlling powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, a wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium introgression line, designated WE99, conferred seedling resistance to 47 of 49 Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the resistance segregation deviated significantly from a single gene Mendelian ratio. However, marker analysis indicated that only a single recessive resistance gene, temporarily designated PmWE99, conferred powdery mildew resistance (Pm). PmWE99 was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS and linked to the three simple sequence repeat markers Gwm148, Gwm271, and Barc55. Using race spectrum analysis, PmWE99 was shown to be significantly different from the documented genes Pm42 and MlIW170 located on chromosome arm 2BS and, thus, appeared to be a new Pm gene. Examination of the genotype frequencies in the F-2:3 families showed that a genetic variation in the PmWE99 interval that favored the transmission of the WE99 allele could be the cause of the deviated segregation. Further investigation revealed that the abnormal segregation only occurred at the PmWE99 interval and was not common at other loci in this population. Identification of PmWE99 will increase the diversity of the Pm genes for wheat improvement.

AB Wheat is one of the major food crops in the world. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an economically important disease that affects wheat worldwide. The discovery of novel resistance genes and the deployment of effectively resistant cultivars are important for the ongoing control of wheat stripe rust and the maintenance of the agricultural productivity of wheat. CH7086, a new stripe rust-resistant wheat introgression line, was selected by crossing susceptible cultivars with the resistant Thinopyrum ponticum-derived partial amphiploid Xiaoyan 7430. The resistance of CH7086 is effective against all current Chinese P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races. CH7086 was crossed with the stripe rust-susceptible cultivars to develop F-1, F-2, F-3, and BC1 populations for genetic analysis. Segregation in the F-2 and BC1 populations and F-2:3 lines were tested for resistance against the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici race CYR32. This test showed that CH7086 carries a single dominant gene for stripe rust resistance, which was temporarily designated YrCH86. The closest of the eight simple sequence repeat (SSR) and expressed sequence tag-SSR markers flanking the locus were X2AS33, which is 1.9 cM distal, and Xmag3807, which is 3.1 cM proximal. The resistance gene and its polymorphic markers were placed in deletion bin 2AS-0.78-1.00 using the 'Chinese Spring' nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic, and deletion lines. The tests of both allelism and resistance specificity suggested that the resistance gene found in CH7086 was not Yr17, which was the only current formally named Yr gene on chromosome 2AS. Thus, YrCH86 appeared to be a new locus and was permanently designated Yr69.

AB Leaf rust is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat causing huge economic losses throughout the world. Several leaf rust resistance genes have been identified and genetically mapped, some of which have also been cloned including the adult plant resistance gene Lr34. Selection of wheat genotypes carrying Lr34 can be accomplished with the help of expression of a morphological marker leaf tip necrosis (LTN) which is linked with Lr34. However, recording of LTN under field conditions is time and labor intensive thereby slowing down the process of selection of desirable genotypes. Use of molecular markers which are tightly linked to Lr34 can be more efficient in precise identification of lines carrying this gene in a short span of time. We selected a total of seven such markers that were earlier reported to be linked with Lr34. The objective of the study was to assess the suitability of these markers in distinguishing Indian bread wheat genotypes carrying Lr34 from those which lacked Lr34. The haplotype analysis suggested that one STS marker (csLV34) and two gene specific markers (cssfr2 and cssfr5) could distinguish wheat genotypes carrying Lr34 from those lacking it. Use of these markers in breeding program can accelerate the speed of selection of desirable genotypes.

AB Insect herbivores from different feeding guilds induce different signaling pathways in plants. In this study, we examined the effects of salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defenses on performance of insect herbivores from two different feeding guilds: cell-content feeders, soybean thrips and phloem feeders, soybean aphids. We used a combination of RT-qPCR analysis and elicitor-induced plant resistance to determine induction of SA and JA signaling pathways and the impact on herbivore performance. In the early interaction between the host plant and the two herbivores, SA and JA signaling seems to occur simultaneously. But overall, soybean thrips induced JA-related marker genes, whereas soybean aphids increased SA and ABA-related marker genes over a 24-h period. Populations of both soybean thrips and soybean aphids were reduced (47 and 25 %, respectively) in methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-pretreated soybean plants. SA treatment has no effect on either herbivore performance. A combination pretreatment of SA and MeJA did not impact soybean thrips population but reduced soybean aphid numbers which was comparable with MeJA treatment. Our data suggest that SA-JA antagonism could be responsible for the effect of hormone pretreatment on thrips performance, but not on aphid performance. By linking plant defense gene expression and elicitor-induced resistance, we were able to pinpoint the role for JA signaling pathway in resistance to two herbivores from different feeding guilds.

AB Pyramiding of alien-derived Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) resistance and resistance enhancing genes in wheat is a cost-effective and environmentally safe strategy for disease control. PCR-based markers and cytogenetic analysis with genomic in situ hybridisation were applied to identify alien chromatin in four genetically diverse populations of wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines incorporating chromosome segments from Thinopyrum intermedium and Secale cereale (rye). Out of 20 experimental lines, 10 carried Th. intermedium chromatin as T4DL*4Ai#2S translocations, while, unexpectedly, 7 lines were positive for alien chromatin (Th. intermedium or rye) on chromosome 1B. The newly described rye 1RS chromatin, transmitted from early in the pedigree, was associated with enhanced WSMV resistance. Under field conditions, the 1RS chromatin alone showed some resistance, while together with the Th. intermedium 4Ai#2S offered superior resistance to that demonstrated by the known resistant cultivar Mace. Most alien wheat lines carry whole chromosome arms, and it is notable that these lines showed intra-arm recombination within the 1BS arm. The translocation breakpoints between 1BS and alien chromatin fell in three categories: (i) at or near to the centromere, (ii) intercalary between markers UL-Thin5 and Xgwm1130 and (iii) towards the telomere between Xgwm0911 and Xbarc194. Labelled genomic Th. intermedium DNA hybridised to the rye 1RS chromatin under high stringency conditions, indicating the presence of shared tandem repeats among the cereals. The novel small alien fragments may explain the difficulty in developing well-adapted lines carrying Wsm1 despite improved tolerance to the virus. The results will facilitate directed chromosome engineering producing agronomically desirable WSMV-resistant germplasm.

AB A new wheat-rye 1BLaEuro cent 1RS translocation line, with the characteristics of superior stripe rust resistance and high thousand-kernel weight and grain number per spike, was developed and identified from progenies of wheat-rye- Psathyrostachys huashanica trigeneric hybrids.
   The wheat-rye 1BLaEuro cent 1RS translocation line from Petkus rye has contributed substantially to the world wheat production. However, due to extensive growing of cultivars with disease resistance genes from short arm of rye chromosome 1R and coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance, these cultivars successively lost resistance to pathogens. In this study, a new wheat-rye line K13-868, derived from the progenies of wheat-rye-Psathyrostachys huashanica trigeneric hybrids, was identified and analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), and molecular markers. Cytological studies indicated that the mean chromosome configuration of K13-868 at meiosis was 2n = 42 = 0.14 I + 18.78 II (ring) + 2.15 II (rod). Sequential FISH and GISH results demonstrated that K13-868 was a compensating wheat-rye 1BLaEuro cent 1RS Robertsonian translocation line. Acid PAGE analysis revealed that clear specific bands of rye 1RS were expressed in K13-868. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and rye 1RS-specific markers omega-sec-p1/omega-sec-p2 and O-SEC5'-A/O-SEC3'-R suggested that the 1BS arm of wheat had been substituted by the 1RS arm of rye. At the seedling and adult growth stage, compared with its recurrent wheat parent SM51 and six other wheat cultivars containing the 1RS arm in southwestern China, K13-868 showed high levels of resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) pathogens prevalent in China, which are virulent to Yr10 and Yr24/Yr26. In addition, K13-868 expresses higher thousand-kernel weight and more grain number per spike than these controls in two growing seasons, suggesting that this line may carry yield-related genes of rye. This translocation line, with significant characteristics of resistance to stripe rust and high thousand-kernel weight and grain number per spike, could be utilized as a valuable germplasm for wheat improvement.

AB Sixteen major QTLs regulating maize kernel traits were mapped in multiple environments and one of them, qKW - 9.2 , was restricted to 630 Kb, harboring 28 putative gene models.
   To elucidate the genetic basis of kernel traits, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was conducted in a maize recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between two diverse parents Zheng58 and SK, evaluated across eight environments. Construction of a high-density linkage map was based on 13,703 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers, covering 1860.9 cM of the whole genome. In total, 18, 26, 23, and 19 QTLs for kernel length, width, thickness, and 100-kernel weight, respectively, were detected on the basis of a single-environment analysis, and each QTL explained 3.2-23.7 % of the phenotypic variance. Sixteen major QTLs, which could explain greater than 10 % of the phenotypic variation, were mapped in multiple environments, implying that kernel traits might be controlled by many minor and multiple major QTLs. The major QTL qKW-9.2 with physical confidence interval of 1.68 Mbp, affecting kernel width, was then selected for fine mapping using heterogeneous inbred families. At final, the location of the underlying gene was narrowed down to 630 Kb, harboring 28 putative candidate-gene models. This information will enhance molecular breeding for kernel traits and simultaneously assist the gene cloning underlying this QTL, helping to reveal the genetic basis of kernel development in maize.

AB SNP markers were developed for the OWBM resistance gene Sm1 that will be useful for MAS. The wheat Sm1 region is collinear with an inverted syntenic interval in B. distachyon.
   Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM, Sitodiplosis mosellana G,hin) is an important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many growing regions. Sm1 is the only described OWBM resistance gene and is the foundation of managing OWBM through host genetics. Sm1 was previously mapped to wheat chromosome arm 2BS relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the dominant, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker WM1. The objectives of this research were to saturate the Sm1 region with markers, develop improved markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), and examine the synteny between wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, and rice (Oryza sativa) in the Sm1 region. The present study mapped Sm1 in four populations relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SSRs, Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and the SCAR WM1. Numerous high quality SNP assays were designed that mapped near Sm1. BLAST delineated the syntenic intervals in B. distachyon and rice using gene-based SNPs as query sequences. The Sm1 region in wheat was inverted relative to B. distachyon and rice, which suggests a chromosomal rearrangement within the Triticeae lineage. Seven SNPs were tested on a collection of wheat lines known to carry Sm1 and not to carry Sm1. Sm1-flanking SNPs were identified that were useful for predicting the presence or absence of Sm1 based upon haplotype. These SNPs will be a major improvement for MAS of Sm1 in wheat breeding programs.

   Fhb1 is a prominent Fusarium head blight resistance locus of wheat, which has been successfully introgressed in adapted breeding material, where it confers a significant increase in overall resistance to the causal pathogen Fusarium graminearum and the fungal virulence factor and mycotoxin deoxynivalenol. The Fhb1 region has been resolved for the susceptible wheat reference genotype Chinese Spring, yet the causal gene itself has not been identified in resistant cultivars. Here, we report the establishment of a 1 Mb contig embracing Fhb1 in the donor line CM-82036. Sequencing revealed that the region of Fhb1 deviates from the Chinese Spring reference in DNA size and gene content, which explains the repressed recombination at the locus in the performed fine mapping. Differences in genes expression between near-isogenic lines segregating for Fhb1 challenged with F. graminearum or treated with mock were investigated in a time-course experiment by RNA sequencing. Several candidate genes were identified, including a pathogen-responsive GDSL lipase absent in susceptible lines. The sequence of the Fhb1 region, the resulting list of candidate genes, and near-diagnostic KASP markers for Fhb1 constitute a valuable resource for breeding and further studies aiming to identify the gene(s) responsible for F. graminearum and deoxynivalenol resistance.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) gene pool was analyzed with 117 microsatellite markers scattered throughout A, B, and D genomes. Ninety microsatellite markers were giving 1620 polymorphic alleles in 55 different bread wheat genotypes. These genotypes were found to be divided into three subgroups based on Bayesian model and Principal component analysis. The highest polymorphism information content value for the markers resides on A genome was estimated for wmc262 marker located on 4A chromosome with the polymorphism information content value of 0.960. The highest polymorphism information content value (0.954) among the markers known to be located on B genome was realized for wmc44 marker located on 1B chromosome. The highest polymorphism information content value for the markers specific to D genome was found in gwm174 marker located on 5D chromosome with the polymorphism information content value of 0.948. The presence of linkage disequilibrium between 81 pairwise SSR markers reside on the same chromosome was tested and very limited linkage disequilibrium was observed. The results confirmed that the most distant genotype pairs were as follows Ceyhan-99-Behoth 6, Gerek 79-Douma 40989, and Karahan-99-Douma 48114.

AB Pink snow mould resulting from Microdochium nivale (Samuels and I.C. Hallett) regularly infects winter triticale (x Triticosecale, Wittm.). Therefore, in the present paper we aimed to identify biochemical markers potentially involved in the increased resistance against M. nivale of this valuable crop. In our experiment, we used two doubled haploid (DH) lines with the highest and the lowest cold-induced snow mould resistance, previously identified in cold chamber tests. The impact of cold-hardening (4 weeks at 4 A degrees C) as well as covering plants with an artificial system to mimic snow covers and inoculation with M. nivale mycelium in leaves of seedlings, different genotypes on the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) activities was assessed. Our studies indicate that, indeed, various genotypes differ in their response to the treatments in regard to the measured parameters. The leaf TBARS content was always lower in seedlings of snow mould-resistant DH1 line in comparison with susceptible DH92 ones, suggesting that tissue damage was more pronounced in plants of the second genotype. The activity of SOD and CAT had no correlation with the level of snow mould resistance. The cold-enhanced POX I activity was higher in DH1 seedlings under the snow-imitating covers with or without M. nivale inoculation in comparison with DH92 plants. Moreover, POX II activity was higher after cold-hardening in the resistant genotype. POX III activity was enhanced by abiotic stress in leaves of DH1 seedlings, while it was not detected in susceptible genotype in any experimental term.

AB African wild rice Oryza brachyantha (FF), a distant relative of cultivated rice Oryza sativa (AA), carries genes for pests and disease resistance. Molecular marker assisted alien gene introgression from this wild species to its domesticated counterpart is largely impeded due to the scarce availability of cross-transferable and polymorphic molecular markers that can clearly distinguish these two species. Availability of the whole genome sequence (WGS) of both the species provides a unique opportunity to develop markers, which are cross-transferable. We observed poor cross-transferability (similar to 0.75 %) of O. sativa specific sequence tagged microsatellite (STMS) markers to O. brachyantha. By utilizing the genome sequence information, we developed a set of 45 low cost PCR based co-dominant polymorphic markers (STS and CAPS). These markers were found cross-transferrable (84.78 %) between the two species and could distinguish them from each other and thus allowed tracing alien genome introgression. Finally, we validated a Monosomic Alien Addition Line (MAAL) carrying chromosome 1 of O. brachyantha in O. sativa background using these markers, as a proof of concept. Hence, in this study, we have identified a set molecular marker (comprising of STMS, STS and CAPS) that are capable of detecting alien genome introgression from O. brachyantha to O. sativa.

AB To determine phenotypic diversity of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), the cause of stem rust of wheat, samples of infected stems were collected during 2009-2013 from commercial wheat fields, experimental plots, and rust trap nurseries across major wheat growing regions of South Africa (SA). Pgt races were identified based on their avirulence/virulence profiles on seedlings of 20 standard and five supplemental differential lines. Nine Pgt races were identified from 521 isolates pathotyped. Predominant races were TTKSF (2SA88, South African race notation) with 39%-85% frequency and BPGSC + Sr27,Kiewiet,Satu (2SA105) with 10%-20% frequency. Race TTKSF is virulent on major resistance genes such as Sr5, Sr6, Sr9e, and Sr38 and is one of the variants of the highly virulent Ug99 race group originally detected in East Africa. Race TYKSP (2SA106), also a member of the Ug99 lineage, was detected in 2009 and 2010. A new race virulent on Sr31, PTKST (2SA107), was detected in 2009. Two new races, TTKSF + Sr9h (2SA88 + Sr9h) and BFBSC (2SA108), were identified in 2010. Race TTKSF + Sr9h is similar to TTKSF except for its virulence on Sr9h. Race BFBSC appears related to Pgt races characterized by avirulence for Sr5 and often attacking triticale. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis indicated that race BFBSC forms part of the non-Ug99 group of South African Pgt races. Despite some similarity in avirulence/virulence phenotype with the non-Ug99 races, BFBSC represents a third distinct genetic lineage within this group. Genes Sr13, 14, 22, 25, 26, 29, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, and 43 that are effective against the new and other Pgt races can be used in resistance breeding in SA. Races like PTKST and TTKSF + Sr9h were also reported in other Southern African countries suggesting that they probably spread to SA from neighbouring regions. The new races are additions to nearly 30 Pgt races identified since the early 1980s, and suggest continued variability of the Pgt population in SA. Therefore, surveys should be conducted regularly to timely detect and manage new races, and utilize the latter in screening and identification of effective sources of resistance.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most widespread and destructive diseases of wheat crop worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred method of controlling diseases, but only a few effective genes are available. M8926-2, a translocation line developed from interspecific hybridization between Leymus mollis and a common wheat genotype 7182, is highly resistant to the prevalent Chinese Pst races. In order to identify gene(s) for stripe rust resistance, M8926-2 was crossed with susceptible genotype Mingxian 169, and seedlings of parents and F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 progenies were tested with the most prevalent Pst race CYR32 under controlled greenhouse conditions. M8926-2 has a single dominant gene, designated as YrM8926, conferring all-stage resistance to CYR32. Genetic mapping was used to identify molecular markers linked to YrM8926. A linkage group of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was constructed for YrM8926 using 191 F2-2 population plants and the gene was located on wheat chromosome 2DS. The wheat-L. mollis translocation line background of M8926-2 and disease assessments indicated that YrM8926 is originally derived from L. mollis. The stripe rust resistance gene and closely linked molecular markers should be useful for pyramiding with other genes to develop wheat cultivars with high-level and long-term resistance to stripe rust.

AB Wheat-Agropyron cristatum 7P disomic addition line II-5-1, derived from the distant hybridization between A. cristatum (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) and the common wheat cv. Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho), displays numerous desirable agronomic traits, including enhanced thousand-grain weight, smaller flag leaf, and enhanced tolerance to drought. In order to transfer these traits into common wheat, II-5-1 was induced by Co-60-gamma ray, leading to the creation of 18 translocation lines and three deletion lines. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that multiple wheat chromosomes were involved in the translocation events, including chromosome 2A, 3A, 5A, 7A, 3B, 5B, 7B, 3D and 7D. A. cristatum 7P chromosome was divided into 15 chromosomal bins with fifty-five sequence-tagged site (STS) markers specific to A. cristatum 7P chromosome. Seven and eight chromosomal bins were located on 7PS and 7PL, respectively. The above-mentioned translocation and deletion lines each contained different, yet overlapping 7P chromosomal fragments, covering the entire A. cristatum 7P chromosome. Three translocation lines (7PT-13, 7PT-14 and 7PT-17) and three deletion lines (del-1, del-2 and del-3), which contained the common chromosomal bins 7PS1-3, displayed higher thousand-grain weigh than Fukuho, suggesting that potential genes conferring high thousand-grain weigh might be located on these chromosomal bins. Therefore, wheat-A. cristatum 7P translocation lines with elite traits will be useful as novel germplasms for wheat genetic improvement.

AB Background: Second-generation ethanol (2G-bioethanol) uses lignocellulosic feedstocks for ethanol production. Sugarcane is one among the most suitable crops for biofuel production. Its juice is extracted for sugar production, while sugarcane bagasse, straw, and senescing leaves are considered industrial waste. Senescence is the age-dependent deterioration of plant cells, ultimately leading to cell death and completion of the plant life cycle. Because senescing leaves may also be used for biofuel production, understanding the process of natural senescence, including remobilization of nutrients and its effect on cell walls can provide useful information for 2G-bioethanol production from sugarcane leaves.
   Results: The natural senescence process in leaves of the commercial sugarcane cultivar RB867515 was investigated. Senescence was characterized by strong reduction in photosynthetic pigments content, remobilization of the nutrients N, P, K, B, Cu, Fe, and Zn, and accumulation of Ca, S, Mg, B, Mn, and Al. No significant changes in the cell-wall composition occurred, and only small changes in the expression of cell wall-related genes were observed, suggesting that cell walls are preserved during senescence. Senescence-marker genes, such as SAG12-like and XET-like genes, were also identified in sugarcane and found to be highly expressed.
   Conclusions: Our study on nutrient remobilization under senescence in a vigorous sugarcane cultivar can contribute to the understanding on how nutrient balance in a high-yielding crop is achieved. In general, neutral monosaccharide profile did not change significantly with leaf senescence, suggesting that senescing leaves of sugarcane can be as a feedstock for biofuel production using pretreatments established for non-senescing leaves without additional efforts. Based on our findings, the potential biotechnological applications for the improvement of sugarcane cultivars are discussed.

AB The aim of the present study was to dissect the genetic inheritance and interplay of root, shoot and heading attributes for a better understanding of these traits in crop production. For this, we utilized quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate gene analysis approach using a second filial (F2) population originated from a cross between spring cultivar Cheri and wild barley accession ICB181160. The F2 population comprising 182 plants was phenotyped for root dry weight (RDW), root volume (RV), root length (RL) and shoot dry weight (SDW), tiller number per plant (TIL) and days to heading (HEA). In parallel, this population was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers distributed across the whole genome. Marker by trait analysis revealed 16 QTL for root and shoot traits localized on chromosomes 1H, 3H, 4H, 5H and 7H. The strongest and a common QTL effect for root, shoot and heading traits was identified on chromosome 7H at the putative region of Vrn-H3 gene. Later, we have established PCR based gene specific marker HvVrnH3 revealing polymorphism for early heading Vrn-H3 allele in Cheri and late heading allele vrn-H3 in ICB181160. Genotyping of these alleles revealed a clear co-segregation of early heading Vrn-H3 allele with lower root and shoot attributes, while late heading vrn-H3 allele with more TIL and higher root biomass suggesting a primary insight on the function of Vrn-H3 gene beyond flowering. Genetic interactions of vernalization genes Vrn-H3 with Vrn-H2 and Vrn-H1 also suggested the major role of Vrn-H3 alleles in determining root and shoot trait variations in barley. We believe, these data provide an opportunity for further research to test a precise significance of early heading on yield components and root associated sustainability in crops like barley and wheat.

AB Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is one of the world's oldest cultivated cereals, which is well-adapted to extreme environments such as drought, heat, and salinity with an efficient C4 carbon fixation. Discovery and identification of genes involved in these processes will provide valuable information to improve the crop for meeting the challenge of global climate change. However, the lack of genetic resources and genomic information make gene discovery and molecular mechanism studies very difficult. Here, we sequenced and assembled the transcriptome of broomcorn millet using Illumina sequencing technology. After sequencing, a total of 45,406,730 and 51,160,820 clean paired-end reads were obtained for two genotypes Yumi No. 2 and Yumi No. 3. These reads were mixed and then assembled into 113,643 unigenes, with the length ranging from 351 to 15,691 bp, of which 62,543 contings could be assigned to 315 gene ontology (GO) categories. Cluster of orthologous groups and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses assigned could map 15,514 unigenes into 202 KEGG pathways and 51,020 unigenes to 25 COG categories, respectively. Furthermore, 35,216 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in 27,055 unigene sequences, of which trinucleotides were the most abundant repeat unit, accounting for 66.72% of SSRs. In addition, 292 differentially expressed genes were identified between the two genotypes, which were significantly enriched in 88 GO terms and 12 KEGG pathways. Finally, the expression patterns of four selected transcripts were validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Our study for the first time sequenced and assembled the transcriptome of broomcorn millet, which not only provided a rich sequence resource for gene discovery and marker development in this important crop, but will also facilitate the further investigation of the molecular mechanism of its favored agronomic traits and beyond.

AB The fibrous root system is a visible sign of ecological adaptation among barley natural populations. In the present study, we utilized rich barley diversity to dissect the genetic basis of root system variation and its link with shoot attributes under well-water and drought conditions. Genome-wide association mapping of phenotype data using a dense genetic map (5892 SNP markers) revealed 17 putative QTL for root and shoot traits. Among these, at 14 loci the preeminence of exotic QTL alleles resulted in trait improvements. The most promising QTL were quantified using haplotype analysis at local and global genome levels. The strongest QTL was found on chromosome 1H which accounted for root dry weight and tiller number simultaneously. Candidate gene analysis across the targeted region detected a crucial amino acid substitution mutation in the conserved domain of a WRKY29 transcription factor among genotypes bearing major and minor QTL alleles. Similarly, the drought inducible QTL QRdw.5H (5H, 95.0 cM) seems to underlie 37 amino acid deletion and substitution mutations in the conserved domain of two related genes CBF10B and CBF10A, respectively. The identification and further characterization of these candidate genes will be essential to decipher genetics behind developmental and natural adaptation mechanisms of barley.

AB Background: The current approach to reducing the tendency for wheat grown under high fertilizer conditions to collapse (lodge) under the weight of its grain is based on reducing stem height via the introduction of Rht genes. However, these reduce the yield of straw (itself an important commodity) and introduce other undesirable characteristics. Identification of alternative height-control loci is therefore of key interest. In addition, the improvement of stem mechanical strength provides a further way through which lodging can be reduced.
   Results: To investigate the prospects for genetic alternatives to Rht, we assessed variation for plant height and stem strength properties in a training genetic diversity panel of 100 wheat accessions fixed for Rht. Using mRNAseq data derived from RNA purified from leaves, functional genotypes were developed for the panel comprising 42,066 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers and 94,060 Gene Expression Markers (GEMs). In the first application in wheat of the recently-developed method of Associative Transcriptomics, we identified associations between trait variation and both SNPs and GEMs. Analysis of marker-trait associations revealed candidates for the causative genes underlying the trait variation, implicating xylan acetylation and the COP9 signalosome as contributing to stem strength and auxin in the control of the observed variation for plant height. Predictive capabilities of key markers for stem strength were validated using a test genetic diversity panel of 30 further wheat accessions.
   Conclusions: This work illustrates the power of Associative Transcriptomics for the exploration of complex traits of high agronomic importance in wheat. The careful selection of genotypes included in the analysis, allowed for high resolution mapping of novel trait-controlling loci in this staple crop. The use of Gene Expression markers coupled with the more traditional sequence-based markers, provides the power required to understand the biological context of the marker-trait associations observed. This not only adds to the wealth of knowledge that we strive to accumulate regarding gene function and plant adaptation, but also provides breeders with the information required to make more informed decisions regarding the potential consequences of incorporating the use of particular markers into future breeding programmes.

AB NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors are known to play important roles in responses to abiotic stresses in plants. Currently, little information regarding the functional roles of NAC genes in stress tolerance is available in Miscanthus lutarioriparius, a promising bioenergy plant for cellulosic ethanol production. In this study, we carried out the functional characterization of MlNAC9 in abiotic stresses. MlNAC9 was shown to act as a nuclear localized transcription activator with the activation domain in its C-terminus. The overexpression of MlNAC9 in Arabidopsis conferred hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) at seed germination and root elongation stages. In addition, the overexpression of MlNAC9 led to increased seed germination rate and root growth under salt (NaCl) treatment. Meanwhile, the transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing MlNAC9 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and cold stresses. The expression of stress-responsive marker genes was significantly increased in MlNAC9 overexpression lines compared to that of WT under ABA, drought, salt, and cold stresses. Correspondingly, the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were significantly increased and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was lower accumulated in MlNAC9 overexpression lines under drought and salt treatments. These results indicated that the overexpression of MlNAC9 improved the tolerance to abiotic stresses via an ABA-dependent pathway, and the enhanced tolerance of transgenic plants was mainly attributed to the increased expression of stress-responsive genes and the enhanced scavenging capability of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

AB Following the emergence of the Ug99 lineage of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) a collective international effort has been undertaken to identify new sources of wheat stem rust resistance effective against these races. Analyses were undertaken in a collection of wheat genotypes gathered from across Africa to identify stem rust resistance effective against the Pgt races found in Eastern and Southern Africa. The African wheat collection consisted of historic genotypes collected in Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan, Zambia, Morocco, and Tunisia, and current South African breeding lines. Both Bayesian cluster and principal coordinate analyses placed the wheat lines from Sudan in a distinct group, but indicated a degree of genetic relatedness among the other wheat lines despite originating from countries across Africa. Seedling screens with Pgt race PTKST, pedigree information and marker haplotype analysis confirmed the presence of Sr2, Sr36, Sr24, Sr31, and Lr34/Yr18/Sr57 in a number of the lines. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) undertaken with Diversiry Arrays Technology (DArT) and stem rust (Sr) gene associated markers and Stem Area Infected (SAI) and Reaction Type (RT) field phenotypes, collected from trials carried out across two seasons in Kenya in 2009 and in South Africa in 2011, identified 29 marker-trait associations (MTA). Three MTA were in common between SAI and RT, with the biggest effect MTA being found on chromosome 6AS. Two wheat lines, W1406 and W6979 that exhibited high levels of adult plant stem rust resistance were selected to generate bi-parental mapping populations. Only the MTA on chromosomes 6AS and 3BS, and the locus Lr34/Yr18/Sr57 were confirmed following QTL mapping. Additional stem rust resistance QTL, not detected by the GWAS, were found on chromosomes 2BS, 2DL, 3DL, and 4D.

AB Bread-making quality traits are central targets for wheat breeding. The objectives of our study were to (1) examine the presence of major effect QTLs for quality traits in a Central European elite wheat population, (2) explore the optimal strategy for predicting the hybrid performance for wheat quality traits, and (3) investigate the effects of marker density and the composition and size of the training population on the accuracy of prediction of hybrid performance. In total 135 inbred lines of Central European bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 1,604 hybrids derived from them were evaluated for seven quality traits in up to six environments. The 135 parental lines were genotyped using a 90k single-nucleotide polymorphism array. Genome-wide association mapping initially suggested presence of several quantitative trait loci (QTLs), but cross-validation rather indicated the absence of major effect QTLs for all quality traits except of 1000-kernel weight. Genomic selection substantially outperformed marker-assisted selection in predicting hybrid performance. A resampling study revealed that increasing the effective population size in the estimation set of hybrids is relevant to boost the accuracy of prediction for an unrelated test population.

AB Background: In wheat, grain filling is closely related to flag leaf characteristics and function. Stomata are specialized leaf epidermal cells which regulate photosynthetic CO2 uptake and water loss by transpiration. Understanding the mechanisms controlling stomatal size, and their opening under drought, is critical to reduce plant water loss and maintain a high photosynthetic rate which ultimately leads to elevated yield. We applied a leaf imprinting method for rapid and non-destructive phenotyping to explore genetic variation and identify quantitative traits loci (QTL) for stomatal traits in wheat grown under greenhouse and field conditions.
   Results: The genetics of stomatal traits on the adaxial surface of the flag leaf was investigated using 146 double haploid lines derived from a cross between two Australian lines of Triticum aestivum, RAC875 and Kukri. The drought tolerant line RAC875 showed numerous small stomata in contrast to Kukri. Significant differences between the lines were observed for stomatal densitity and size related traits. A negative correlation was found between stomatal size and density, reflecting a compensatory relationship between these traits to maintain total pore area per unit leaf surface area. QTL were identified for stomatal traits on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2B, and 7A under field and controlled conditions. Most importantly some of these loci overlap with QTL on chromosome 7A that control kernel number per spike, normalized difference vegetation index, harvest index and yield in the same population.
   Conclusions: In this first study to decifer genetic relationships between wheat stomatal traits and yield in response to water deficit, no significant correlations were observed among yield and stomatal traits under field conditions. However we found some overlaps between QTL for stomatal traits and yield across environments. This suggested that stomatal traits could be an underlying mechanism increasing yield at specific loci and used as a proxy to track a target QTL in recombinant lines. This finding is a step-forward in understanding the function of these loci and identifying candidate genes to accelerate positional cloning of yield QTL in wheat under drought.

TI Influence of the Semi-dwarf Growth Type on Seed Yield and Agronomic
   Parameters at Low and High Nitrogen Fertilization in Winter Oilseed Rape
SO CROP SCIENCE

ID BRASSICA-NAPUS-L.; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY;
   GENE; MARKERS; OIL; MAP
AB In cereals like wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or rice (Oryza sativa L.), a short-straw ideotype is characteristic for all modern cultivars, mainly due to the use of genes affecting the dwarf genotype. In oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), several dwarf mutants are known but so far not widely used. An interesting approach is the production of semi-dwarf hybrids from dwarf and normal-type parents, which might have an increased harvest index (HI) and a higher grain yield, especially when nitrogen (N) availability is restricted. To this point, no systematic comparison using a large number of semi-dwarf and normal-type hybrids has been published. A double haploid (DH) population was developed that was segregating for the bzh dwarf locus with 54 dwarf and 54 normal-type lines. By crossing with a normal-type tester, 108 testcrosses were produced with 54 hybrids each of semi-dwarf and normal types. These were evaluated under high and zero N fertilization in five and seven environments, respectively, for yield and agronomic parameters. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were estimated for yield-relevant traits. Semi-dwarf hybrids had a significantly higher yield compared with normal types in N-deficient conditions (2.24 and 2.05 Mg ha(-1)). At an optimal N supply, no significant difference between growth types was found for seed yield. Oil content was slightly lower in semi-dwarfs under both N treatments, whereas this was compensated by oil yield. All major QTL for plant height, straw yield, HI, and seed yield co-segregated with the bzh dwarf locus on linkage group A06, indicating that the dwarf gene is not only reducing plant height but also causing increased HI and higher yield under N limitation for semi-dwarf hybrids. We conclude that semi-dwarf hybrids are of high interest for the N-balanced oilseed rape production, especially when N is scarce.

AB Aluminum toxicity is a major yield constraint of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in acidic soils, which compose a significant area of Earth's arable land. There is natural variation in wheat's Al tolerance and a tolerance gene on chromosome 4D named ALMT1 has been cloned and characterized. Some wheat populations, however, show much variation in acidic field tolerance that is not explained by known major Al tolerance loci. This study was conducted to discover new loci that condition wheat's tolerance of low soil pH with the ultimate goal of DNA marker development for expedited tolerance breeding and selection. To this end, two diverse populations of the US Pacific Northwest (PNW)-adapted winter wheat were genotyped on recently developed 9K and 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic marker platforms and phenotyped in three low-pH, Al-toxic field settings. The first population consisted of 459 accessions of soft white wheat. The second population, which was further phenotyped hydroponically, consisted of 401 accessions, some of which were soft white and some hard red. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) uncovered a total of 55 loci, 15 of which were common to both populations. The molecular marker wmc331, linked to ALMT1, was analyzed in both populations, revealing only eight individuals with the favorable allele. We found that the unique germplasm examined in this study has novel sources of low-pH tolerance that could be exploitable in the development of wheat cultivars that are tolerant of soil acidity and Al toxicity.

AB 'Jagger' has been used widely as a parent to develop hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties throughout the US southern Great Plains. Jagger has resistance to the stem rust pathogen race TTTTF, which is virulent to many winter wheat cultivars, yet the genetic basis of this resistance was unknown. Marker analysis and resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust demonstrated that Jagger has the 2NS/2AS translocation from T. ventricosum (Tausch) Ces., Pass. & Gilelli. This segment contains resistance genes Sr38, Lr37, and Yr17. Stem rust infection types on Jagger, however, indicated that an additional stem rust resistance gene is present. Jagger is resistant to TTTTF whereas the Sr38 stem rust differential line 'VPM1' is susceptible. A BC1F3 population developed from the cross Jagger/2*'LMPG-6' was tested with race TTTTF. Resistant and susceptible DNA bulks were genotyped with a custom 9000 SNP Illumina iSelect Bead Chip using bulked segregant analysis. We identified a locus linked with the resistance gene on chromosome arm 4AL, where Sr7 is located. Crosses between Jagger BC1F3 lines resistant to TTTTF and germplasm with Sr7a identified no recombinants, indicating that resistance to TTTTF in Jagger could be conferred by Sr7a. We confirmed the effectiveness of Sr7a resistance to race TKTTF, which caused the stem rust epidemic in Ethiopia from 2013 to 2014. The molecular markers identified in this study may be used to screen for the resistance gene Sr7a and track its presence in breeding programs.

AB Genetic resistance plays an important role in managing powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a disease of global importance. The objectives of this study were to evaluate powdery mildew resistance and the underlying genes in US wheat breeding lines and identify novel resistance sources from a worldwide collection of winter wheat germplasm. Our results suggested that 37.5% of powdery mildew resistant breeding lines recently developed in the United States carry the Pm3a gene, indicating the abundance of Pm3a in US cultivars. Among a worldwide collection of 1,297 landraces and 874 early cultivars or breeding lines, 59 and 68 accessions showed high (HR) and moderate resistance (MR), respectively. In addition, highly resistant plants were identified in 41 heterogeneous accessions. These resistant accessions were further screened for the presence of Pm3a, Pm3b, Pm3c, Pm3d, and Pm3f genes as well as the 1RS translocation segment. Among them, 13 accessions had a Pm3 allele, and another seven accessions possessed the 1BL/1RS translocation fragment with the Pm8 gene. Genetic diversity analysis based on a set of 5,011 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified genetically similar accessions. The deployment of resistance sources identified in this study in wheat breeding may greatly broaden the genetic base of powdery mildew resistance.

AB Landraces and old, obsolete cultivars are a rich source of diversity and could become important and easy-to-use germplasm resources for breeding. They are characterised by yield stability, broad adaptation, tolerance to diseases and a greater competitiveness in the presence of weeds. The main objective of this study was to estimate and compare the genetic diversity among and within landraces, old cultivars and modern cultivars of common oat. Inter simple sequence repeats were used to study the genetic diversity of 12 modern Polish cultivars, 23 old Polish cultivars, 19 native landraces and 5 contemporary European cultivars. The results indicated a low amount of diversity among Polishmodern cultivars, but an even lower diversity among old Polish cultivars, as well as large differences between these two gene pools. As expected, the landraces were the most diverse group and showed the highest internal variation. The landraces and old cultivars might serve as sources of useful alleles that have never been used in breeding. Additionally, it was possible to identify errors and inconsistencies in the passport data of gene-bank accessions. These results can be applied to the maintenance and management of gene-bank collections.

AB The D-genome progenitor of wheat (Triticum aestivum), Aegilops tauschii, possesses numerous genes for resistance to abiotic stresses, including drought. Therefore, information on the genetic architecture of A. tauschii can aid the development of drought-resistant wheat varieties. Here, we evaluated 13 traits in 373 A. tauschii accessions grown under normal and polyethylene glycol-simulated drought stress conditions and performed a genome-wide association study using 7,185 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We identified 208 and 28 SNPs associated with all traits using the general linear model and mixed linear model, respectively, while both models detected 25 significant SNPs with genome-wide distribution. Public database searches revealed several candidate/flanking genes related to drought resistance that were grouped into three categories according to the type of encoded protein (enzyme, storage protein, and drought-induced protein). This study provided essential information for SNPs and genes related to drought resistance in A. tauschii and wheat, and represents a foundation for breeding drought-resistant wheat cultivars using marker-assisted selection.

AB Phs-A1 confers resistance to sprouting in wheat by delaying the rate of seed dormancy loss and is distinct from the previously proposed PM19 candidate genes.The precocious germination of cereal grains before harvest, also known as pre-harvest sprouting, is an important source of yield and quality loss in cereal production. Pre-harvest sprouting is a complex grain defect and is becoming an increasing challenge due to changing climate patterns. Resistance to sprouting is multi-genic, although a significant proportion of the sprouting variation in modern wheat cultivars is controlled by a few major quantitative trait loci, including Phs-A1 in chromosome arm 4AL. Despite its importance, little is known about the physiological basis and the gene(s) underlying this important locus. In this study, we characterized Phs-A1 and show that it confers resistance to sprouting damage by affecting the rate of dormancy loss during dry seed after-ripening. We show Phs-A1 to be effective even when seeds develop at low temperature (13 A degrees C). Comparative analysis of syntenic Phs-A1 intervals in wheat and Brachypodium uncovered ten orthologous genes, including the Plasma Membrane 19 genes (PM19-A1 and PM19-A2) previously proposed as the main candidates for this locus. However, high-resolution fine-mapping in two bi-parental UK mapping populations delimited Phs-A1 to an interval 0.3 cM distal to the PM19 genes. This study suggests the possibility that more than one causal gene underlies this major pre-harvest sprouting locus. The information and resources reported in this study will help test this hypothesis across a wider set of germplasm and will be of importance for breeding more sprouting resilient wheat varieties.

AB Integration of the methods of contemporary genetics and biotechnology into the breeding process is assessed, and the potential role and efficacy of genome editing as a novel approach is discussed. Use of molecular (DNA) markers for breeding was proposed more than 30 years ago. Nowadays, they are widely used as an accessory tool in order to select plants by mono- and olygogenic traits. Presently, the genomic approaches are actively introduced into the breeding processes owing to automatization of DNA polymorphism analyses and development of comparatively cheap methods of DNA sequencing. These approaches provide effective selection by complex quantitative traits, and are based on the full-genome genotyping of the breeding material. Moreover, biotechnological tools, such as doubled haploids production, which provides fast obtainment of homozygotes, are widely used in plant breeding. Use of genomic and biotechnological approaches makes the development of varieties less time consuming. It also decreases the cultivated areas and financial expenditures required for accomplishment of the breeding process. However, the capacities of modern breeding are not limited to only these advantages. Experiments carried out on plants about 10 years ago provided the first data on genome editing. In the last two years, we have observed a sharp increase in the number of publications that report about successful experiments aimed at plant genome editing owing to the use of the relatively simple and convenient CRISPR/Cas9 system. The goal of some of these experiments was to modify agriculturally valuable genes of cultivated plants, such as potato, cabbage, tomato, maize, rice, wheat, barley, soybean and sorghum. These studies show that it is possible to obtain nontransgenic plants carrying stably inherited, specifically determined mutations using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This possibility offers the challenge to obtain varieties with predetermined mono- and olygogenic traits.

AB Australian cultivar Sunco carries three adult plant stripe rust resistance genes. One of these genes corresponded to Yr18 in chromosome 7DS; the second, YrCK, was mapped on chromosome 2D. Here, we describe the characterization of the third adult plant resistance (APR) gene from Sunco. Sunco/2*Avocet S-derived lines SA65 (resistant) and SA67 (susceptible) were crossed and a recombinant inbred line F-6 population was generated. Monogenic segregation among SA65/SA67-derived RIL population was demonstrated and the resistance locus was designated YrSA3. Selective genotyping using an iSelect 90 K Infinium SNP array and SSR markers located YrSA3 on chromosome 3D. Development of KASP markers for SNP loci showing association with YrSA3 allowed construction of a genetic map harboring the resistance gene. Ten KASP markers (KASP_8306, KASP_9142, KASP_10438, KASP_16434, KASP_17207, KASP_20836, KASP_23518, KASP_23615, KASP_57983 and KASP_63653), one SSR marker (gwm114b) and Lr24/Sr24 were mapped 1.8 cM distal to YrSA3. Comparison of marker data indicated that the previously named seedling stripe rust resistance gene Yr45 was located proximal to YrSA3, and therefore the latter was formally designated Yr71. Two recombinants carrying Lr24/Sr24 and Yr71 in combination were identified for use as donor sources in wheat breeding programs. The robustness of gwm114b, KASP_16434, KASP_17207 and KASP_20836 for marker-assisted selection of these genes was demonstrated through tests on 74 Australian wheat cultivars.

AB Neottopteris nidus is an economically important foliage plant. However, the EST sequence resources available for N. nidus are still very limited. In this study, we present the first transcriptome analysis of N. nidus using the Illumina sequencing technology. More than 53 million reads were generated in transcriptome analysis, and de novo assembly generated 41,173 unigenes with an average length of 969 bp. The similarity search indicated that 24,801 unigenes (60.23 %) had significant similarity with proteins in the NR and Swiss-Prot protein databases. Among these annotated unigenes, 15,683 and 7942 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and Clusters of Orthologous Groups, respectively. A total of 5548 unigenes were mapped into 116 pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. Some abundant transcripts related to photomorphogenesis and development, including chlorophyll a-b-binding protein, phototropin, amino acid transporter, ATP-binding protein, expansin, and ribosomal protein, were identified in the N. nidus transcriptome. In total, 5792 potential EST-SSRs were identified among the unigenes. The most abundant type of repeat was dinucleotide (3836, 66.24 %), followed by trinucleotide (1575, 27.19 %) and tetranucleotide (207, 3.57 %) repeats. The dominant repeat motif was CT/GA (1229, 21.22 %), followed by AG/TC (905, 15.63 %), CA/GT (504, 11.32 %), and AC/TG (339, 8.70 %). In addition, a total of 100 potential marker sites were selected to validate the assembly quality and develop EST-SSR markers. This study generated a substantial fraction of N. nidus transcriptome sequences, which were very useful resources for gene discovery and molecular marker development.

AB Evaluation of wheat for spot blotch disease resistance relies on various visual observation methods. The person evaluating the lines needs to be experienced in scoring disease severity. To facilitate high-throughput phenotyping, a hand-held green seeker NDVI sensor was used to map spot blotch disease resistance QTLs. A total of 108 germplasm lines along with 335 SSD-derived lines (F-4 and F-5 generations) originating from the cross 'YS116 x Sonalika' were used. The population was evaluated at BISA, Pusa Bihar, a hot spot for spot blotch, for 2 consecutive years. Data were recorded using the NDVI as well as by visual observation as % disease severity. The correlation coefficient was calculated between two scoring methods (NDVI and % DS) recorded at different growth stages. High negative correlation was observed between the NDVI and % DS at GS69 and GS77 on Zadoks' scale. With both methods, the QTL was mapped in the same chromosomal region on 5BL. Using the NDVI value, the detected QTL explained up to 54.9 % of phenotypic variation while up to 56.1 % using the % DS. The Sb2 gene was mapped between the markers Xgwm639 and Xgwm1043 with an interval of 0.62 cM. The markers linked to the Tsn1 gene (Xfcp1 and Xfcp623) were mapped 1.1 cMapart fromthe sb2 gene. It is concluded that the NDVI the can be used as an alternative to visual scoring of spot blotch disease in wheat and create a new avenue for high-throughput phenotyping.

AB With increasing consumer demand for vegetables, edible-podded peas have become more popular. Stringlessness is one of most important traits for snap peas. A single recessive gene, sin-2, controls this trait. Because pollen carrying the stringless gene is less competitive than pollen carrying the stringy gene, there are fewer than expected stringless plants recovered in segregating generations. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is a valuable tool to identify plants with the traits of interest at an early stage in the breeding process. The objective of this study was to identify robust, user-friendly molecular markers tightly linked to sin-2. A total of 144 target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) primer combinations were used to screen four DNA bulks, which were constructed from 32 pea breeding lines based on their phenotypes. Sixty polymorphic TRAP primer combinations were identified between bulks of stringless and stringy pods. Five primer combinations, F6_Trap03_168, F6_SA12_145, F10_ODD8_130, F11_GA5_850, and F12_SA12_190, showed more than 90 % association with the stringless phenotype in 32 pea breeding lines. Two of the TRAP markers, F10_ODD8_130 and F12_SA12_190, were cloned, sequenced, and successfully converted to sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. These two SCAR markers were validated using 20 F5 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Bohatyr (a dry pea variety with strings) and S1188 (a stringless snap pea variety) and showed strong marker-trait association. The results will have direct application in MAS of stringless edible-podded peas.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) and stem rust are two devastating fungal diseases of common wheat prevalent worldwide. Fhb1 is a well-known major quantitative trait locus effective against FHB, and Sr2 is the most widely characterized and deployed wheat stem rust adult plant resistance gene. These genes are linked in repulsion phase, approximately 3 cM apart, on chromosome 3B. To obtain wheat germplasm containing both Fhb1 and Sr2 genes, we developed and screened two F-2 populations using tightly linked DNA markers, Xgwm533 and csSr2 for Sr2, and UMN10, and a newly designed marker UMN10(v2) for Fhb1. Among 1949 F-2 plants, 43 were identified with Fhb1 and Sr2 in coupling phase. After screened with vernalization gene markers, 59 F-3 spring wheat lines with homozygous Fhb1 and Sr2 were obtained. All these lines showed significantly lower FHB severity than susceptible checks (P < 0.01) and similar FHB severity to the resistant checks (P > 0.61) in the field. And these lines were susceptible as seedlings in greenhouse assays, but resistant as adult plants to race QTHJC in the stem rust nursery. Field disease resistance evaluation verified that all these recombinant lines showed moderate or high levels of resistance to both FHB and stem rust. This germplasm would benefit efforts to breed for resistance to FHB and stem rust, and the procedure to obtain recombinants is adaptable to other wheat breeding programs.

AB The objective of this study was to identify microsatellites molecular markers linked to R genes, that confer the wheat grain color and evaluate the association with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance. This study was conducted with a F-2 population with 203 plants, derived from the cross between PFAU x CD0666 genotypes, which segregates for one grain color gene. Were analyzed 43 molecular markers located in regions that containing R genes on 3B and 3D chromosomes. The Xbarc344 molecular marker was identified as linked to the R gene at a distance of 26.1 cM with 83.25% of selection efficiency. From the phenotypic analysis was confirmed the association between grain color with Xbarc344 molecular marker, however, there was no association between Xbarc344 with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance. Also, there was no association between grain color with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance. Although the grain color in wheat is a trait easy to select, it is known that not all R genes are involved with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance. Therefore, it is important the genetic mapping and specific evaluation of each R gene with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance. Thus, the molecular markers identified as associated with each R gene can be used to select plants that contain such genes, since it is not possible to identify phenotypically which R gene each plant has.

AB Present study was aimed to screening the population of 25 wheat genotypes from Baluchistan region of Pakistan along with five commercial cultivars for leaf rust adult plant resistance (APR) through gene postulation using natural inoculation of Puccinia triticina Erikss local pathotype. Infection severity was recorded on scale in comparison with susceptible control "Morroco" cultivar. On the basis of phenotypic score, seven accessions and four varieties (Zardana-89, Sariab-92, Zarlashta-99 and Raskoh-05) with AUDPC values up to 20% were characterized as resistant genotypes. Coefficient of infection (CI) score ranged from 0-10 for some accessions and cultivars showing high level of adult plant resistance. Furthermore, bi-allelic STS marker csLV34 having close linkage with Lr34 (0.4cM). This marker amplified one gene specific allele of 150bp in 21 genotypes, including 19 accessions and two commercial varieties (Sariab-92 and Zarghoon-79) which confirmed presence of Lr34 gene conferring adult plant resistance against leaf rust. The rust pathogenicity scale varied for accessions from resistant to moderately susceptible. However, beside Lr34, phenotypic gene postulation, in combination with marker assisted selection for leaf rust resistance, has revealed presence of some other unknown resistance genes in local wheat germplasm which signified its use in wheat improvement programs both locally and abroad.

AB This study examines genomic prediction within 8416 Mexican landrace accessions and 2403 Iranian landrace accessions stored in gene banks. The Mexican and Iranian collections were evaluated in separate field trials, including an optimum environment for several traits, and in two separate environments (drought, D and heat, H) for the highly heritable traits, days to heading (DTH), and days to maturity (DTM). Analyses accounting and not accounting for population structure were performed. Genomic prediction models include genotype x environment interaction (G x E). Two alternative prediction strategies were studied: (1) random cross-validation of the data in 20% training (TRN) and 80% testing (TST) (TRN20-TST80) sets, and (2) two types of core sets, "diversity" and "prediction", including 10% and 20%, respectively, of the total collections. Accounting for population structure decreased prediction accuracy by 15-20% as compared to prediction accuracy obtained when not accounting for population structure. Accounting for population structure gave prediction accuracies for traits evaluated in one environment for TRN20-TST80 that ranged from 0.407 to 0.677 for Mexican landraces, and from 0.166 to 0.662 for Iranian landraces. Prediction accuracy of the 20% diversity core set was similar to accuracies obtained for TRN20-TST80, ranging from 0.412 to 0.654 for Mexican landraces, and from 0.182 to 0.647 for Iranian landraces. The predictive core set gave similar prediction accuracy as the diversity core set for Mexican collections, but slightly lower for Iranian collections. Prediction accuracy when incorporating G x E for DTH and DTM for Mexican landraces for TRN20-TST80 was around 0.60, which is greater than without the G x E term. For Iranian landraces, accuracies were 0.55 for the G x E model with TRN20-TST80. Results show promising prediction accuracies for potential use in germplasm enhancement and rapid introgression of exotic germplasm into elite materials.

AB Finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.] is grown mainly by subsistence farmers in arid and semiarid regions of the world. To broaden its genetic base and to boost its production, it is of paramount importance to characterize and genotype the diverse gene pool of this important food and nutritional security crop. However, as a result of nonavailability of the genome sequence of finger millet, the progress could not be made in realizing the molecular basis of unique qualities of the crop. In the present investigation, attempts have been made to characterize the genetically diverse collection of 113 finger millet accessions through whole-genome genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), which resulted in a genome-wide set of 23,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating across the entire collection and several thousand SNPs segregating within every accession. A model-based population structure analysis reveals the presence of three subpopulations among the finger millet accessions, which are in parallel with the results of phylogenetic analysis. The observed population structure is consistent with the hypothesis that finger millet was domesticated first in Africa, and from there it was introduced to India some 3000 yr ago. A total of 1128 gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned to SNP-carrying genes for three main categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Facilitated access to high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are likely to improve the breeding process in developing countries, and as such, this data will be very useful to breeders who are working for the genetic improvement of finger millet.

AB Manganese efficiency is a quantitative abiotic stress trait controlled by several genes each with a small effect. Manganese deficiency leads to yield reduction in winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Breeding new cultivars for this trait remains difficult because of the lack of visual symptoms and the polygenic features of the trait. Hence, Mn efficiency is a potential suitable trait for a genomic selection (GS) approach. A collection of 248 winter barley varieties was screened for Mn efficiency using Chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence in six environments prone to induce Mn deficiency. Two models for genomic prediction were implemented to predict future performance and breeding value of untested varieties. Predictions were obtained using multivariate mixed models: best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) and genomic best linear unbiased predictor (G-BLUP). In the first model, predictions were based on the phenotypic evaluation, whereas both phenotypic and genomic marker data were included in the second model. Accuracy of predicting future phenotype, r((g) over cap, (y) over bar), and accuracy of predicting true breeding values, r ((g) over cap, g), were calculated and compared for both models using six cross-validation (CV) schemes; these were designed to mimic plant breeding programs. Overall, the CVs showed that prediction accuracies increased when using the G-BLUP model compared with the prediction accuracies using the BLUP model. Furthermore, the accuracies [ r ((g) over cap, g)] of predicting breeding values were more accurate than accuracy of predicting future phenotypes [ r ((g) over cap, (y) over bar)]. The study confirms that genomic data may enhance the prediction accuracy. Moreover it indicates that GS is a suitable breeding approach for quantitative abiotic stress traits.

AB Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a globally devastating foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). More than a dozen genes against this disease, identified from wheat germplasms of different ploidy levels, have been mapped to the region surrounding the Pm1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 7A, which forms a resistance (R)-gene cluster. Mlm2033 and Mlm80 from einkorn wheat (T. monococcum L.) were two of the R genes belonging to this cluster. This study was initiated to fine map these two genes toward map-based cloning. Comparative genomics study showed that macrocolinearity exists between Brachypodium distachyon L. chromosome 1 (Bd1) and the Mlm2033-Mlm80-Pm1a region, which allowed us to develop markers based on the wheat sequences orthologous to genes contained in the Bd1 region. With these and other newly developed and published markers, high-resolution maps were constructed for both Mlm2033 and Mlm80 using large F-2 populations. Moreover, a physical map of Mlm2033 was constructed through chromosome walking with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and comparative mapping. Eventually, Mlm2033 and Mlm80 were restricted to a 0.12- and 0.86-cM interval, respectively. Based on the closely linked common markers, Mlm2033, Mlm80, and MlIW172 (another powdery mildew resistance gene in the Pm1 cluster) were not allelic to one another. Severe recombination suppression and disruption of synteny were noted in the region encompassing Mlm2033. These results provided useful information for map-based cloning of the R genes in the Pm1 cluster and interpretation of their evolution.

AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a crucial, under-researched crop feeding millions worldwide, especially in Africa. Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has plagued production in Africa for over a century. Biparental mapping studies suggest primarily a single major gene mediates resistance. To investigate this genetic architecture, we conducted the first genome-wide association mapping study in cassava with up to 6128 genotyping-by-sequenced African breeding lines and 42,113 reference genome-mapped single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We found a single region on chromosome 8 that accounts for 30 to 66% of genetic resistance in the African cassava germplasm. Thirteen additional regions with small effects were also identified. Further dissection of the major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 8 revealed the presence of two possibly epistatic loci and/or multiple resistance alleles, which may account for the difference between moderate and strong disease resistances in the germplasm. Search of potential candidate genes in the major QTL region identified two peroxidases and one thioredoxin. Finally, we found genomic prediction accuracy of 0.53 to 0.58 suggesting that genomic selection (GS) will be effective both for improving resistance in breeding populations and identifying highly resistant clones as varieties.

AB DNA-based methods have been advanced as excellent alternatives for the detection and quantification of gluten-containing cereals. In this study, it was intended to evaluate the effect of three distinct food matrices on the performance three TaqMan real-time PCR approaches targeting 2-gliadin, agglutinin isolectin (Tri a 18) and thioredoxin h(Tri a 25) genes of wheat. The results of wheat flour detection in soya bean, maize and rice model matrices evidenced that sensitivity was considerably affected by both the food matrix and the target gene. Rice matrix allowed the highest sensitivity, in opposition to soya bean. The 2-gliadin method enabled the best sensitivity, especially when combined with rice matrix (5mgkg(-1)), followed by maize (10mgkg(-1)) and soya bean (50mgkg(-1)). These findings suggest that food matrix effects need to be carefully evaluated when developing real-time PCR assays for wheat detection/quantification, but without compromising their great effectiveness as tools to monitor gluten-containing cereals.

AB Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), is a potentially devastating disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Great Plains of North America. So far, two genes conferring resistance to WSMV have been named and used in cultivar improvement. Here we report a new source of resistance that was derived from a wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey ditelosomic addition line containing, in addition to the wheat chromosome complement, a pair of long arm telochromosomes from Th. intermedium previously believed to be of group-4 origin. New molecular marker and genomic in situ hybridization analysis revealed that this telochromosome is homeologous to the group-7 long arms and belongs to the S genome of Th. intermedium. Accordingly, this chromosome was designated as 7S#3L. One compensating Robertsonian translocation was obtained where the 7S#3L arm was translocated to the short arm of wheat chromosome 7B, resulting in the T7BS.7S#3L translocation chromosome. Homozygous T7BS.7S#3L lines were evaluated for their resistance to WSMV and Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV). The T7BS.7S#3L stock confers resistance to WSMV at 18 and 24 degrees C. The T7BS.7S#3L stock also confers resistance to TriMV at 18 C but is not effective above 24 degrees C. Based on chromosome position and effective resistance to WSMV at 24 degrees C where both Wsm1 and Wsm2 are ineffective, the new gene in T7BS.7S#3L is designated as Wsm3.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) disease of global importance. The widely used dwarfing allele Rht-D1b has recently been shown to compromise FHB resistance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of this dwarfing allele in a segregating population with major resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) derived from 'Sumai-3' and Nobeokabozu, and to determine how many resistance QTL are needed to counteract its negative effect. Fusarium head blight resistance was evaluated in four field trials with spray inoculation and two field trials with point inoculation in a double-haploid (DH) population from a cross between the Swedish cv. Avle (susceptible spring type; wild-type allele Rht-D1a) and Line 685 (resistant winter type; semi-dwarf allele Rht-D1b). The Rht-D1 locus explained up to 38% of the phenotypic variation and was the most important QTL for FHB severity under spray inoculation but did not show any effect after point inoculation. Fhb1 on 3BS was detected with both inoculation methods but was relatively more important after point inoculation. Another two QTL on 5A and 2BL were detected after spray inoculation and a QTL on 2D after point inoculation. Comparison of phenotypic effects of different allele combinations revealed that a combination of both Fhb1 and the 5A QTL was required to counteract the increased susceptibility of Rht-D1b. Although breeding of FHB resistant cultivars with this dwarfing allele is possible, it requires the pyramiding of several resistant QTL to achieve adequate levels of resistance.

AB Yellow rust, also known as stripe rust, is caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks (PST) and is one of the most common and persistent wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) diseases worldwide. A mapping population of recombinant inbred lines from the cross of 'Jagger' (moderately resistant) x '2174' (moderately susceptible) was tested at three sites in Washington where predominant races PST-114 and PST-116 naturally occurred, at Rossville, KS, where PST-100 was inoculated, and in Beijing, China, where a predominant Chinese stripe rust race CYR32 was inoculated on adult plants. A major quantitative trait locus for adult-plant stripe rust resistance was located on the short arm of chromosome 2A (QYr.osu-2A), where Jagger was found to carry markers for resistance gene Yr17 from Aegilops ventricosa Tausch (syn. Triticum ventricosum). Therefore, Yr17 is likely the resistance gene on chromosome 2A in Jagger. Markers for Yr17 were found to occur frequently in cultivars from the southern Great Plains but only occasionally in cultivars from other U.S. wheat regions. A novel resistance gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5A (QYr.osu-5A), for which the Jagger allele showed consistent resistance to multiple races of the stripe rust pathogen. A significant genetic effect of the resistance gene Lr34/Yr18 from 2174 was detected only when the population was tested with CYR32 in China.

AB Introduction of genes from outside a primary germplasm base has the potential to impact phenotypic diversity, genetic structure, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Our goals were to monitor the introduction of key genes in a hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm set using historical cultivars, to determine the impact of the introduced genes on phenotypic diversity in elite germplasm, and to assess the impact of selection history on LD. A superior allele for bread making was introduced early in the 20th century and quickly became fixed. An allele for solid stems introduced in the mid 20th century is the major source of variation in current germplasm. An introduced allele for photoperiod insensitivity is an important source of variation for heading date in current germplasm. The allelic introductions impacted patterns of LD. The unlinked loci for reduced height, RHT-B1 and RHT-D1, were in LD. Linkage disequilibrium for physically linked markers near introduced genes did not exceed previous estimates of genome-wide LD. Our results showed a pattern of gene introductions into the spring wheat germplasm base that continues to have an impact on phenotypic diversity and patterns of LD.

AB Background: In the study of associations between genomic data and complex phenotypes there may be relationships that are not amenable to parametric statistical modeling. Such associations have been investigated mainly using single-marker and Bayesian linear regression models that differ in their distributions, but that assume additive inheritance while ignoring interactions and non-linearity. When interactions have been included in the model, their effects have entered linearly. There is a growing interest in non-parametric methods for predicting quantitative traits based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions on markers and radial basis functions. Artificial neural networks (ANN) provide an alternative, because these act as universal approximators of complex functions and can capture non-linear relationships between predictors and responses, with the interplay among variables learned adaptively. ANNs are interesting candidates for analysis of traits affected by cryptic forms of gene action.
   Results: We investigated various Bayesian ANN architectures using for predicting phenotypes in two data sets consisting of milk production in Jersey cows and yield of inbred lines of wheat. For the Jerseys, predictor variables were derived from pedigree and molecular marker (35,798 single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPS) information on 297 individually cows. The wheat data represented 599 lines, each genotyped with 1,279 markers. The ability of predicting fat, milk and protein yield was low when using pedigrees, but it was better when SNPs were employed, irrespective of the ANN trained. Predictive ability was even better in wheat because the trait was a mean, as opposed to an individual phenotype in cows. Non-linear neural networks outperformed a linear model in predictive ability in both data sets, but more clearly in wheat.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that neural networks may be useful for predicting complex traits using high-dimensional genomic information, a situation where the number of unknowns exceeds sample size. ANNs can capture nonlinearities, adaptively. This may be useful when prediction of phenotypes is crucial.

AB The compact (dwarf) plant architecture is an important trait in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) breeding that has the potential to be used in once-over mechanical harvest of cucumber production. Compact growth habit is controlled by a simply inherited recessive gene cp. With 150 F(2:3) families derived from two inbred cucumber lines, PI 308915 (compact vining) and PI 249561 (regular vining), we conducted genome-wide molecular mapping with microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers. A framework genetic map was constructed consisting of 187 SSR loci in seven linkage groups (chromosomes) covering 527.5 cM. Linkage analysis placed cp at the distal half of the long arm of cucumber Chromosome 4. Molecular markers cosegregating with the cp locus were identified through whole genome scaffold-based chromosome walking. Fine genetic mapping with 1,269 F2 plants delimited the cp locus to a 220 kb genomic DNA region. Annotation and function prediction of genes in this region identified a homolog of the cytokinin oxidase (CKX) gene, which may be a potential candidate of compact gene. Alignment of the CKX gene homologs from both parental lines revealed a 3-bp deletion in the first exon of PI 308915, which can serve as a marker for marker-assisted selection of the compact phenotype. This work also provides a solid foundation for map-based cloning of the compact gene and understanding the molecular mechanisms of the dwarfing in cucumber.

AB Productive tiller number (PTN), defined as the number of tillers that produce spikes and seeds, is a key component of grain yield in wheat. Spring wheat cultivars in the northern Great Plains of North America differ in PTN. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the relationship of PTN to agronomic traits using recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations derived from crosses Reeder/Conan, McNeal/Thatcher and Reeder/McNeal grown under a range of environments, and (2) to identify and validate quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with high PTN. Correlation between PTN and plot weight ranged from r = 0.4-0.6 among the populations based on combined means over years, and was positive in every environment for all crosses (P < 0.05). A genetic map generated for the Reeder/Conan RIL allowed identification of a QTL for PTN consistent over environments, located on chromosome 6B. The QTL on chromosome 6B (QTn.mst-6B) explained 9-17% of the variation of PTN and co-segregated with a QTL for yield in the Reeder/Conan RIL. QTn. mst-6B was validated by single marker analysis in the McNeal/Thatcher RIL, McNeal/Reeder RIL, and a set of near isogenic line (NIL) developed for QTn. mst-6B. The allele for high PTN significantly increased PTN by 8.7, 4, and 13% in the McNeal/Reeder RIL, McNeal/Thatcher RIL and Choteau/Reeder NIL, respectively. The allele for high PTN also had a significant positive effect on plot weight in the McNeal/Reeder RIL. Our results suggest that high PTN, controlled to a significant extent by QTn. mst-6B, contributed to increased yield potential over a range of environmental conditions. QTn. mst-6B may be useful for improving spring wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America and similar environments.

AB Qfhi.nau-5A is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) against Fusarium graminearum infection in the resistant wheat germplasm Wangshuibai. Genetic analysis using BC(3)F(2) and BC(4)F(2) populations, derived from selfing two near-isogenic lines (NIL) heterozygous at Qfhi.nau-5A that were developed, respectively, with Mianyang 99-323 and PH691 as the recurrent parent, showed that Qfhi.nau-5A inherited like a single dominant gene. This QTL was thus designated as Fhb5. To fine map it, these two backcross populations and a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from Nanda2419 x Wangshuibai were screened for recombinants occurring between its two flanking markers Xbarc56 and Xbarc100. Nineteen NIL recombinants were identified from the two backcross populations and nine from the RIL population. In the RIL recombinant selection process, selection against Fhb4 present in the RIL population was incorporated. Genotyping these recombinant lines with ten markers mapping to the Xbarc56-Xbarc100 interval revealed four types of Mianyang 99-323-derived NIL recombinants, three types of PH691-derived NIL recombinants, and four types of RIL recombinants. In different Weld trials, the percentage of infected spikes of these lines displayed a distinct two-peak distribution. The more resistant class had over 55% less infection than the susceptible class. Common to these resistant genotypes, the 0.3-cM interval flanked by Xgwm304 and Xgwm415 or one of these two loci was derived from Wangshuibai, while none of the susceptible recombinants had Wangshuibai chromatin in this interval. This interval harboring Fhb5 was mapped to the pericentromeric C-5AS3-0.75 bin through deletion bin mapping. The precise localization of Fhb5 will facilitate its utilization in marker-assisted wheat breeding programs.

AB A spontaneous interspecific Robertsonian translocation was revealed by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in the progenies of a monosomic 7H addition line originating from a new wheat 'Asakaze komugi' x barley 'Manas' hybrid. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA sequences (Afa family, pSc119.2, and pTa71) allowed identification of all wheat chromosomes, including wheat chromosome arm 4BS involved in the translocation. FISH using barley telomere- and centromere-specific repetitive DNA probes (HvT01 and (AGGGAG)(n)) confirmed that one of the arms of barley chromosome 7H was involved in the translocation. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers specific to the long (L) and short (S) arms of barley chromosome 7H identified the translocated chromosome segment as 7HL. Further analysis of the translocation chromosome clarified the physical position of genetically mapped SSRs within 7H, with a special focus on its centromeric region. The presence of the HvCslF6 gene, responsible for (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan production, was revealed in the centromeric region of 7HL. An increased (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan level was also detected in the translocation line, demonstrating that the HvCslF6 gene is of potential relevance for the manipulation of wheat (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan levels.

AB Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy, a wild relative of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), is the source of many agronomically important genes for wheat improvement. Production of compensating Robertsonian translocations (cRobTs), consisting of D. villosum chromosome arms translocated to homoeologous wheat chromosome arms, is one of the initial steps in exploiting this variation. The cRobTs for D. villosum chromosomes 1V, 4V, and 6V have been reported previously. Here we report attempted cRobTs for wheat - D. villosum chromosome combinations 2D/2V, 3D/3V, 5D/5V, and 7D/7V. The cRobTs for all D. villosum chromosomes were recovered except for the 2VS and 5VL arms. As was the case with the 6D/6V combination, no cRobTs involving 2D/2V chromosomes were recovered; instead, cRobT T2BS.2VL involving a non-targeted chromosome was recovered. All cRobTs are fertile, although the level of spike fertility and hundred kernel weight (HKW) varied among the lines. The set of cRobTs involving 12 of the 14 D. villosum chromosomes will be useful in wheat improvement programs. In fact, among the already reported cRobTs, T6AL.6VS carrying the Pm21 gene is deployed in agriculture and many useful genes have been reported on other cRobTs including resistance to stem rust race UG99 on T6AS.6VL.

AB Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) known as a relatively drought-tolerant crop across the world is grown in arid and semi-arid regions. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic study on drought tolerance screening of foxtail millet germplasm being a drought-tolerant crop has been reported so far. To explore genetic diversity of drought-induced oxidative stress tolerance in foxtail millet, we employed lipid peroxidation measure to assess membrane integrity under stress as biochemical marker to screen 107 cultivars and classified the genotypes as highly tolerant, tolerant, sensitive, and highly sensitive. From this comprehensive screening, four cultivars showing differential response to dehydration tolerance were selected to understand the physiological and biochemical basis of tolerance mechanisms. The dehydration-tolerant cultivars (IC-403579 and Prasad) showed considerably lower levels of lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage as compared with dehydration-sensitive cultivars (IC-480117 and Lepakshi), indicating better cell membrane integrity in tolerant cultivars. Correspondingly, tolerant genotypes maintained higher activity of catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11), and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.6.4.2) across different time-course period of polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments in comparison to sensitive ones. The above biochemical results were further validated through quantitative real-time PCR analysis of APX and GR, whose transcripts were substantially induced by PEG treatments in tolerant cultivars. These results suggest that tolerant cultivars possess wider array of antioxidant machinery with efficient ascorbate-glutathione pathway to cope with drought-induced oxidative stress.

AB Many root-colonizing pseudomonads are able to promote plant growth by increasing phosphate availability in soil through solubilization of poorly soluble rock phosphates. The major mechanism of phosphate solubilization by pseudomonads is the secretion of gluconic acid, which requires the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase and its cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether a PQQ biosynthetic gene is suitable to study the phylogeny of phosphate-solubilizing pseudomonads. To this end, two new primers, which specifically amplify the pqqC gene of the Pseudomonas genus, were designed. pqqC fragments were amplified and sequenced from a Pseudomonas strain collection and from a natural wheat rhizosphere population using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. Phylogenetic trees based on pqqC sequences were compared to trees obtained with the two concatenated housekeeping genes rpoD and gyrB. For both pqqC and rpoD-gyrB, similar main phylogenetic clusters were found. However, in the pqqC but not in the rpoD-gyrB tree, the group of fluorescent pseudomonads producing the antifungal compounds 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and pyoluteorin was located outside the Pseudomonas fluorescens group. pqqC sequences from isolated pseudomonads were differently distributed among the identified phylogenetic groups than pqqC sequences derived from the cultivation-independent approach. Comparing pqqC phylogeny and phosphate solubilization activity, we identified one phylogenetic group with high solubilization activity. In summary, we demonstrate that the gene pqqC is a novel molecular marker that can be used complementary to housekeeping genes for studying the diversity and evolution of plant-beneficial pseudomonads.

AB An understanding of the inheritance of aluminium (Al) tolerance is important to breed for Al-tolerant genotypes of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Therefore, a study was undertaken to infer genes governing Al tolerance in chickpea. Tolerant lines 'ICC14880' and 'IPC92-39' were crossed with sensitive lines 'IPCK96-3' and 'IPC99-4'. Parental, F(1), F(2), F(3) and backcross generations were evaluated in a nutrient solution containing 20 ppm Al for haematoxylin staining and root re-growth and classified for tolerance by staining of root tips and root re-growth. The F(1) hybrids responded similarly to the tolerant parents indicating dominance of Al tolerance over sensitivity. Segregation for tolerance vs. sensitivity in F(2) fitted well with the 3 : 1 ratio expected for a single gene. The backcross and F(3) data confirmed the presence of single dominant gene common in tolerant parents. Experimental findings showed that Al tolerance is a monogenic dominant trait that can be easily transferred to high yielding lines through a backcross breeding.

AB The distribution of alleles at the Lr34 locus associated with leaf rust resistance has been studied in soft winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars developed in Ukraine. To determine the allelic state of the Lr34 locus, codominant molecular marker cssfr5 has been used. Cultivars with the revealed Lr34(+) and Lr34(-) alleles have been identified as potentially resistant or susceptible, respectively. A collection of 81 cultivars from the main breeding centers of Ukraine has been examined; the Lr34(+) allele has been revealed in 44% of the tested cultivars. The obtained results have been compared with general data on the leaf rust resistance of wheat cultivars from different countries.

AB Gurung, S., Goodwin, S. B., Kabbage, M., Bockus, W. W., and Adhikari, T. B. 2011. Genetic differentiation at microsatellite loci among populations of Mycosphaerella graminicola from California, Indiana, Kansas, and North Dakota. Phytopathology 101:1251-1259.
   Mycosphaerella graminicola causes Septoria tritici blotch (STB) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and is considered one of the most devastating pathogens of that crop in the United States. Although the genetic structures of M. graminicola populations from different countries have been analyzed using various molecular markers, relatively little is known about Al. graminicola populations from geographically distinct areas of the United States and, in particular, of those from spring versus winter wheat. These are exposed to great differences in environmental conditions, length and season of host-free periods, and resistance sources used in geographically separated wheat breeding programs. Thus, there is more likely to be genetic differentiation between populations from spring versus winter wheat than there is among those within each region. To test this hypothesis, 330 single-spore isolates of M. graminicola representing 11 populations (1 from facultative winter wheat in California, 2 from spring wheat in North Dakota, and 8 from winter wheat in Indiana and Kansas) were analyzed for mating type frequency and for genetic variation at 17 microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Analysis of clone-corrected data revealed an equal distribution of both mating types in the populations from Kansas, Indiana, and North Dakota, but a deviation from a I:I ratio in the California population. In total, 306 haplotypes were detected, almost all of which were unique in all II populations. High levels of gene diversity (H = 0.31 to 0.56) were observed within the 11 populations. Significant (P <= 0.05) gametic disequilibrium, as measured by the index of association (rBarD), was observed in California, one Indiana population (IND, and three populations (KS1, KS2, and KS3) in Kansas that could not be explained by linkage. Corrected standardized fixation index (G ''(ST)) values were 0.000 to 0.621 between the 11 populations and the majority of pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (P <= 0.001), suggesting some differentiation between populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed that there was a small but statistically significant level of genetic differentiation between populations from spring versus winter wheat. However, most of the total genetic variation (>98%) occurred within spring and winter wheat regions while <2% was due to genetic differentiation between these regions. Taken together, these results provide evidence that sexual recombination occurs frequently in the M. graminicola populations sampled and that most populations are genetically differentiated over the major spring- and winter-wheat-growing regions of the United States.

AB Plant resistance (R) genes are highly effective in protecting plants against diseases, but pathogens can overcome such genes relatively easily by adaptation. Consequently, in many cases R genes do not confer durable resistance in agricultural environments. One possible strategy to make the use of R genes more sustainable depends on the modification of R genes followed by transformation. To test a possible transgenic use of R genes, we overexpressed in wheat the Pm3b resistance gene against powdery mildew under control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. Four independent transgenic lines were tested in the greenhouse and the field during 3 years. The four lines showed a five-to 600-fold transgene overexpression compared with the expression of the endogenous Pm3b gene in the landrace 'Chul'. Powdery mildew resistance was significantly improved in all lines in the greenhouse and the field, both with naturally occurring infection or after artificial inoculation. Under controlled environmental conditions, the line with the strongest overexpression of the Pm3b gene showed a dramatic increase in resistance to powdery mildew isolates that are virulent on the endogenous Pm3b. Under a variety of field conditions, but never in the greenhouse, three of the four transgenic lines showed pleiotropic effects on spike and leaf morphology. The highest overexpressing line had the strongest side effects, suggesting a correlation between expression level and phenotypic changes. These results demonstrate that the successful transgenic use of R genes critically depends on achieving an optimal level of their expression, possibly in a tissue-specific way.

AB Background: Revolver is a newly discovered multi-gene family of transposable elements in the Triticeae genome. Revolver encompasses 2929 to 3041 bp, has 20 bp of terminal inverted repeated sequences at both ends, and contains a transcriptionally active gene encoding a DNA-binding-like protein. A putative TATA box is located at base 221, with a cap site at base 261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at base 2918. Revolver shows considerable quantitative variation in wheat and its relatives.
   Results: Revolver cDNAs varied between 395 and 2,182 bp in length. The first exon exhibited length variation, but the second and third exons were almost identical. These variants in the Revolver family shared the downstream region of the second intron, but varied structurally at the 5' first exon. There were 58 clones, which showed partial homology to Revolver, among 440,000 expressed sequence tagged (EST) clones sourced from Triticeae. In these Revolver homologues with lengths of 360-744 bp, the portion after the 2nd exon was conserved (65-79% homology), but the 1st exon sequences had mutually low homology, with mutations classified into 12 types, and did not have EST sequences with open reading frames (ORFs). By PCR with the 3'-flanking region of a typical genomic clone of Revolver-2 used as a single primer, rye chromosomes 1R and 5R could be simultaneously identified. Extensive eco-geographic diversity and divergence was observed among 161 genotypes of the single species Triticum dicoccoides collected from 18 populations in Israel with varying exposures to abiotic and biotic stresses (soil, temperature, altitude, water availability, and pathogens).
   Conclusions: On the base of existing differences between Revolver variants, the molecular markers that can distinguish different rye chromosomes were developed. Eco-geographic diversification of wild emmer T. dicoccoides in Israel and high Revolver copy numbers are associated with higher rainfall and biotic stresses. The remarkable quantitative differences among copy numbers of Revolver in the same species from different ecosystems suggest strong amplification activity within the last 10,000 years. It is the interesting finding because the majority of Triticeae high-copy transposable elements seem to be inactive at the recent time except for BARE-1 element in Hordeum and the fact might be interesting to perceive the processes of plant adaptive evolution.

AB Genetic maps of wheat chromosome 1D consisting of 57 microsatellite marker loci were constructed using Chinese Spring (CS) x Chiyacao F(2) and the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) mapping populations. Marker order was consistent, but genetic distances of neighboring markers were different in two populations. Physical bin map of 57 microsatellite marker loci was generated by means of 10 CS 1D deletion lines. The physical bin mapping indicated that microsatellite marker loci were not randomly distributed on chromosome 1D. Nineteen of the 24 (79.2%) microsatellite markers were mapped in the distal 30% genomic region of 1DS, whereas 25 of the 33 (75.8%) markers were assigned to the distal 59% region of 1DL. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm24, originating from the Chinese wheat landrace Chiyacao, was previously mapped in the vicinity of the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 1D. A high density genetic map of chromosome 1D was constructed, consisting of 36 markers and Pm24, with a total map length of 292.7 cM. Twelve marker loci were found to be closely linked to Pm24. Pm24 was flanked by Xgwm789 (Xgwm603) and Xbarc229 with genetic distances of 2.4 and 3.6 cM, respectively, whereas a microsatellite marker Xgwm1291 co-segregated with Pm24. The microsatellite marker Xgwm1291 was assigned to the bin 1DS5-0.70-1.00 of the chromosome arm 1DS. It could be concluded that Pm24 is located in the '1S0.8 gene-rich region', a highly recombinogenic region of wheat. The results presented here would provide a start point for the map-based cloning of Pm24.

AB Gene flow between domesticated species and their wild relatives is receiving growing attention. This study addressed introgression between wheat and natural populations of its wild relatives (Aegilops species). The sampling included 472 individuals, collected from 32 Mediterranean populations of three widespread Aegilops species (Aegilops geniculata, Ae. neglecta and Ae. triuncialis) and compared wheat field borders to areas isolated from agriculture. Individuals were characterized with amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting, analysed through two computational approaches (i.e. Bayesian estimations of admixture and fuzzy clustering), and sequences marking wheat-specific insertions of transposable elements. With this combined approach, we detected substantial gene flow between wheat and Aegilops species. Specifically, Ae. neglecta and Ae. triuncialis showed significantly more admixed individuals close to wheat fields than in locations isolated from agriculture. In contrast, little evidence of gene flow was found in Ae. geniculata. Our results indicated that reproductive barriers have been regularly bypassed during the long history of sympatry between wheat and Aegilops.

AB Vernalization and photoperiod response genes play a significant role in the geographical adaptation, agronomic performance and yield potential of crops. Therefore, understanding the distribution pattern and allelic diversity for vernalization and photoperiod genes are important in any wheat breeding program. In this study, we screened 63 bread wheat cultivars and 7 bread wheat landraces from Turkey for photoperiod (Ppd-D1) and vernalization genes (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1 and Vrn-B3) using diagnostic molecular markers. The photoperiod insensitive dominant allele, Ppd-D1a, was present in 60% of wheat cultivars and 42% of landraces, whereas, all other genotypes carried the photoperiod sensitive allele Ppd-D1b as recessive allele. Twenty-four cultivars and two landraces contained recessive alleles for all four VRN loci, whereas 39 wheat cultivars and 6 landraces contained one or more dominant VRN alleles. The highest percentage of Turkish wheat cultivars contained the dominant Vrn-B1 allele followed by Vrn-D1 and Vrn-A1. Information for vernalization and photoperiod alleles in Turkish germplasm will facilitate the planning and implementation of molecular markers in wheat breeding programs. This information will be helpful to develop elite wheat cultivars carrying suitable vernalization and photoperiod alleles with higher grain yield potential and better quality suitable for different production environments through marker assisted selection.

AB In crosses between hexaploid wheat and inbred lines of rye, a small number of rye genotypes produce seeds carrying undifferentiated, non-viable embryos. Hybrids between such lines and those not showing this phenotype were used as pollen donors in crosses with bread wheat in order to determine the genetic basis of disturbed embryo development. A single gene, designated Eml-R1b, is causing this character. Molecular markers associated with F(2) genotypes derived from a contrasting rye inbred progeny were used for a linkage study. Recombinant inbred lines of an F(5) population served as testers. Eml-R1b maps to chromosome arm 6RL, along with two co-segregating microsatellite loci, Xgwm1103 and Xgwm732. Complementary interactions of deleterious genes in wheat and rye are discussed.

AB Wheat preharvest sprouting (PHS) occurs when seed germinates on the plant before harvest resulting in reduced grain quality. In wheat, PHS susceptibility is correlated with low levels of seed dormancy. A previous mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) revealed a major PHS/seed dormancy QTL, QPhs.cnl-2B.1, located on wheat chromosome 2B. A comparative genetic study with the related grass species rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon at the homologous region to the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval was used to identify the candidate genes for marker development and subsequent fine mapping. Expressed sequence tags and a comparative mapping were used to design 278 primer pairs, of which 22 produced polymorphic amplicons that mapped to the group 2 chromosomes. Fourteen mapped to chromosome 2B, and ten were located in the QTL interval. A comparative analysis revealed good macrocollinearity between the PHS interval and 3 million base pair (mb) region on rice chromosomes 7 and 3, and a 2.7-mb region on Brachypodium Bd1. The comparative intervals in rice were found to contain three previously identified rice seed dormancy QTL. Further analyses of the interval in rice identified genes that are known to play a role in seed dormancy, including a homologue for the putative Arabidopsis ABA receptor ABAR/GUN5. Additional candidate genes involved in calcium signaling were identified and were placed in a functional protein association network that includes additional proteins critical for ABA signaling and germination. This study provides promising candidate genes for seed dormancy in both wheat and rice as well as excellent molecular markers for further comparative and fine mapping.

ID STEM SOLIDNESS LOCUS; GROWTH HABIT; MARKERS; GENES
AB 'Duclair' hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Reg. No. CV-1060, PI 660981) was developed by the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 2011. The objective for the development of Duclair was to provide a solid-stemmed, semidwarf cultivar for areas infested by the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Nort.). Duclair was developed through initial generations of single seed descent of F 2 seed from a 'Choteau'/MT0249 cross. Progeny lines were selected to have solid stems from Choteau, and extended green leaf duration from MT0249. Duclair was tested as MT0832 at sites across Montana in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Stem solidity of Duclair is similar to the solid-stemmed cultivar 'Fortuna' and slightly less than 'Choteau'. Duclair has shown good yield potential throughout Montana and its height is more desirable for dry conditions than Choteau. Duclair has grain protein levels similar to other hard red spring wheat cultivars and acceptable milling and baking characteristics. Duclair will be of interest to wheat growers in sawfly-infested areas of Montana and adjoining regions.

No. GP-862, PI 653714), Wahoo-Wsm1 (Reg. No. GP-863, PI 653715), and Wesley-Wsm1 (Reg. No. GP-864, PI 653716)-were codeveloped by Washington State University, Pullman, WA; the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE; and the USDA-ARS. These seven different winter wheat cultivars were selected to provide more sources of effective resistance to WSMV in winter wheat cultivars of Nebraska and adjoining states. Resistance to WSMV is conferred by the Wsm1 gene, which was translocated from Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey [Agropyron intermedium (Horst.) Beauv.] into wheat. The STSJ15 marker was used to select for the gene in the backcross progeny until the BC(4)F(1) generation. In BC(4)F(2) generation, screening for disease resistance was done using the Sidney 81 isolate of WSMV, along with the recurrent parents. Lines showing high levels of resistance to WSMV were further selected for seed increase and field evaluation. These lines may serve as a winter wheat source of WSMV resistance and may be used for gene pyramiding and for studying the effect of the Wsm1 gene in different backgrounds.

No. GP-872, PI 660988) ('Yellowstone'*4/KS96WGRC40) were developed by transferring the resistance gene Lr41 for leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.) and the resistance gene Cmc4 for wheat curl mite (WCM; Aceria tosichella Keifer) from HRW wheat germplasm KS96WGRC40 into Montana HRW wheat Yellowstone using marker-assisted selection. Putatively resistant lines were selected with PCR markers in the BC(3)F(2) generation. Resistance to leaf rust and WCM was confirmed by screening under controlled conditions in the BC(3)F(3) and BC(3)F(4) generations, respectively. MT06X424-B6 and MT06X424-B20 are resistant to leaf rust (isolate PBJL) and wheat curl mite. MT06X424-B6 is phenotypically similar to the recurrent parent Yellowstone. MT06X424-B20 is shorter than Yellowstone and has low kernel polyphenol oxidase.

AB During the last decades, with the intensification of selection and breeding using crosses between varieties, a very complex genetic structure was shaped in the elite wheat germplasm. However, precise description of this structure with panels and collections is becoming more and more crucial with the development of resource management and new statistical tools for mapping genetic determinants (e.g. association studies). In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of 195 Western European elite wheat varieties using the recent development of high throughput screening methods for molecular markers. After observing that both microsatellites and Diversity Array Technology markers are efficient to estimate the structure of the panel, we used different complementary approaches (Genetic distances, principal component analysis) that showed that the varieties are separated by geographical origin (France, Germany and UK) and also by breeding history, confirming the impact of plant breeding on the wheat germplasm structure. Moreover, by analysing three phenotypic traits presenting significant average differences across groups (plant height, heading date and awnedness), and by using markers linked to major genes for these traits (Ppd-D1, Rht-B1, Rht-D1 and B1), we showed that for each trait, there is a specific optimal Q matrix to use as a covariate in association tests.

AB Genes on chromosomes six (Wsm1), three (Wsm2) and ten (Wsm3) in the maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line Pa405 control resistance to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), and the same or closely linked genes control resistance to Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). Near isogenic lines (NIL) carrying one or two of the genes were developed by introgressing regions of the respective chromosomes into the susceptible line Oh28 and tested for their responses to WSMV, MDMV, and SCMV in the field and greenhouse. F(1) progeny from NIL x Oh28 were also tested. Wsm1, or closely linked genes, provided resistance to all three viruses, as determined by symptom incidence and severity. Wsm2 and Wsm3 provided resistance to WSMV. Wsm2 and/or Wsm3 provided no resistance to MDMV, but significantly increased resistance in plants with one Wsm1 allele. NIL carrying Wsm1, Wsm2, or Wsm3 had similar SCMV resistance in the field, but NIL with Wsm2 and Wsm3 were not resistant in the greenhouse. Addition of Wsm2 to Wsm1 increased SCMV resistance in the field. For all viruses, symptom incidence was higher in the greenhouse than in the field, and relative disease severity was higher in the greenhouse for WSMV and MDMV. An Italian MDMV isolate and the Ohio SCMV infected the Wsm1 NIL, while the Ohio MDMV and Seehausen SCMV isolates did not. Our results indicate that the three genes, or closely linked loci, provide virus resistance. Resistance conferred by the three genes is influenced by interactions among the genes, the virus species, the virus isolate, and the environment.

AB Constitutive promoters are widely used to functionally characterise plant genes in transgenic plants, but their lack of specificity and poor control over protein expression can be a major disadvantage. On the other hand, promoters that provide precise regulation of temporal or spatial transgene expression facilitate such studies by targeting over-expression or knockdown of target genes to specific tissues and/or at particular developmental stages. Here, we used the uidA (beta-glucuronidase, GUS) reporter gene to demonstrate that the barley Hvhsp17 gene promoter can be induced by heat treatment of 38-40 degrees C for 1-2 h in transgenic wheat. The GUS enzyme was expressed only in those tissues directly exposed to heat and not in neighbouring leaf tissues. The induction of HSP:: GUS was demonstrated in all organs and tissues tested, but expression in older tissues was lower. Generally, proximal root sections showed less GUS activity than in root tips. This heat-inducible promoter provides the ability to investigate the function of candidate genes by overexpression or by down-regulation of target gene expression (for example by RNAi) in selected tissues or developmental stages of a transgenic plant, limited only by the ability to apply a heat shock to the selected tissues. It also allows the investigation of genes that would be lethal or reduce fertility if expressed constitutively.

AB A new Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system was developed for finger millet using shoot apex explants. The Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 harboring binary vector pCAMBIA1301, which contained hygromycin phosphotransferase (hptII) as selectable marker gene and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as reporter gene, was used for optimization of transformation conditions. Two finger millet genotypes, GPU 45 and CO 14, were used in this study. The optimal conditions for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of finger millet were found to be the co-cultivation of explants obtained on the 16th day after callus induction (DACI), exposure of explants for 30 min to agrobacterial inoculum and 3 days of co-cultivation on filter paper placed on medium supplemented with 100 mu M acetosyringone (AS). Addition of 100 mu M l-cysteine in the selection medium enhanced the frequency of transformation and transgenic plant recovery. Both finger millet genotypes were transformed by Agrobacterium. A frequency of 19% transient expression with 3.8% stable transformation was achieved in genotype GPU 45 using optimal conditions. Five stably transformed plants were fully characterized by Southern blot analysis. A segregation analysis was also performed in four R(1) progenies, which showed normal Mendelian pattern of transgene segregation. The inheritance of transgenes in R(1) progenies was also confirmed by Southern blot analysis. This is the first report on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of finger millet. This study underpins the introduction of numerous agronomically important genes into the genome of finger millet in the future.

AB We used gametocidal (Gc) chromosomes 2C and 3C(SAT) to dissect barley 2H added to common wheat. The Gc chromosome induces chromosomal breakage resulting in chromosomal aberrations in the progeny of the 2H addition line of common wheat carrying the monosomic Gc chromosome. We conducted in situ hybridization to select plants carrying structurally rearranged aberrant 2H chromosomes and characterized them by sequential C-banding and in situ hybridization. We established 66 dissection lines of common wheat carrying single aberrant 2H chromosomes. The aberrant 2H chromosomes were of either deletion or translocation or complicated structural change. Their breakpoints were distributed in the short arm (2HS), centromere (2HC) and the long arm (2HL) at a rough 2HS/2HC/2HL ratio of 2:1:2. We conducted PCR analysis of the 66 dissection lines using 115 EST markers specific to chromosome 2H. Based on the PCR result, we constructed a physical or cytological map of chromosome 2H that were divided into 34 regions separated by the breakpoints of the aberrant 2H chromosomes. Forty-seven markers were present in 2HS and 68 in 2HL. We compared the 2H cytological map with a previously reported 2H genetic map using 44 markers that were used in common to construct both maps. The order of markers in the distal region was the same on both maps but that in the proximal region was somewhat contradictory between the two maps. We found that the markers distributed rather evenly in the genetic map were actually concentrated in the distal regions of both arms as revealed by the cytological map. We also recognized an EST-marker or gene-rich region in the 2HL interstitial region slightly to the telomere.

AB Cultivated chickpea is the third most important legume after field bean and garden pea worldwide. Despite considerable breeding towards improved yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, the production of chickpea remained stagnant, but molecular tools are expected to increase the impact of current improvement programs. As a first step towards this goal, various genetic linkage maps have been established and markers linked to resistance genes been identified. However, until now, only one linkage group (LG) has been assigned to a specific chromosome. In the present work, mitotic chromosomes were sorted using flow cytometry and used as template for PCR with primers designed for genomic regions flanking microsatellites. These primers amplify sequence-tagged microsatellite site markers. This approach confirmed the assignment of LG8 to the smallest chromosome H. For the first time, LG5 was linked to the largest chromosome A, LG4 to a medium-sized chromosome E, while LG3 was anchored to the second largest chromosome B. Chromosomes C and D could not be flow-sorted separately and were jointly associated to LG6 and LG7. By the same token, chromosomes F and G were anchored to LG1 and LG2. To establish a set of preferably diagnostic cytogenetic markers, the genomic distribution of various probes was verified using FISH. Moreover, a partial genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed and putative single/low-copy BAC clones were mapped cytogenetically. As a result, two clones were identified localizing specifically to chromosomes E and H, for which no cytogenetic markers were yet available.

AB Stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis) occurs annually in most wheat-growing areas of the world. Thinopyrum ponticum has provided novel rust resistance genes to protect wheat from this fungal disease. Wheat - Th. ponticum partial amphiploid line 7430 and a substitution line X005 developed from crosses between wheat and 7430 were resistant to stripe rust isolates from China. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis using Pseudoroegneria spicata genomic DNA as a probe demonstrated that the partial amphiploid line 7430 contained ten J(s) and six J genome chromosomes, and line X005 had a pair of J(s)-chromosomes. Giemsa-C banding further revealed that both lines 7430 and X005 were absent of wheat chromosomes 6B. The EST based PCR confirmed that the introduced J(s) chromosomes belonging to linkage group 6, indicating that line X005 was a 6J(s)/6B substitution line. Both resistance observation and sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers displayed that the introduced chromosomes 6J(s) were responsible for the stripe rust resistances. Therefore, lines 7430 and X005 can be used as a donor in wheat breeding for stripe rust resistance.

AB Crossability between wheat and rye is an important trait for wheat improvement. No quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected from wheat ancestors previously. The objectives of this study were to dissect the QTLs for crossability using 111 introgression lines (ILs) derived from synthetic hexaploid wheat. A total of 1275 SSR markers were screened for polymorphism between the two parents, and 552 markers of them displayed polymorphism, of which 64 were selected for genotyping the 111 BC5F6 ILs. Field trials were performed in a Latinized alpha-lattice design in Luoyang and Jiaozuo of Henan Province of China in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 cropping seasons. One-way ANOVA and interval mapping (IM) analysis were used to detect QTL for crossability between wheat and rye. A total of 13 putative QTLs were detected. Five of them, QCa.caas.1A, QCa.caas.2D, QCa.caas.4B, QCa.caas.5B and QCa.caas.6A, were detected in both trials and three of them, QCa.caas.2D, QCa.caas.4B and QCa.caas.6A, were novel. The positive effect allele of the four QTLs came from the donor parent Am3 except QCa.caas.6A that came from the recurrent parent Laizhou953. ILs with both higher positive effect alleles and favorable agronomic traits developed in present study are elite germplasm for wide crossing in wheat. Results from the current study suggest that wheat ancestors can be rich in new sources of crossability genes.

AB Breeding for resistance is an efficient strategy to manage wheat leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici. However, a prerequisite for the directed use of Lr genes in breeding and the detection of new races virulent to these Lr genes is a detailed knowledge on Lr genes present in wheat cultivars. Therefore, respective molecular markers for 18 Lr genes were tested for specificity and used to determine Lr genes in 115 wheat cultivars. Results obtained were compared to available pedigree data. Using respective molecular markers, genes Lr1, Lr10, Lr26, Lr34 and Lr37 were detected, but data were not always in accordance with pedigree data. However, leaf rust scoring data of field trials confirmed the reliability of DNA markers. These reliable marker data facilitated the analyses of the development of virulent leaf rust races from 2002 to 2009 based on released cultivars. A sudden change from low infection rates to susceptibility was observed for Lr1, Lr3, Lr10, Lr13, Lr14, Lr16, Lr26 and Lr37 since 2006. Cultivars carrying several leaf rust resistance genes showed no significant shift to susceptibility except one cultivar which revealed an increasing infection rate at a low level. In summary, it turned out that pedigree data are often not reliable and a detection of Lr genes by diagnostic markers is fundamental to combine Lr genes in cultivars for a durable resistance against leaf rust, and to conduct reliable surveys based on released cultivars, instead of 'Thatcher' NILs.

AB Groundnut, an important crop of many countries of the world, is susceptible to a range of diseases and pests. High levels of resistances are not available in the cultivated gene pool as the crop is said to have a narrow genetic base. Narrow genetic base is attributed to the evolution of the crop which took place by the combination of A and B genome species, and later doubling their chromosome number, giving rise to tetraploid cultivated groundnut. Direct utilization of cross-compatible wild relatives, which are diploids, to broaden the genetic base and introduction of useful traits, is not a straight-forward process due to ploidy differences between the cultivated species and wild relatives. Hence amphiploids and autotetraploids were created by not only combining the putative genomes, but many other A and B genome species, thus producing a highly variable population of tetraploid groundnuts also called new sources of Arachis hypogaea. This study describes the development and characterization of newly generated tetraploid groundnuts and the level of molecular diversity as assessed by DArT markers.

ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L; RUST RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR MARKERS; HEXAPLOID

AB Genetic suppression of disease resistance is occasionally observed in hexaploid wheat or in its interspecific crosses. The phenotypic effects of genes moved to wheat from relatives with lower ploidy are often smaller than in the original sources, suggesting the presence of modifiers or partial inhibitors in wheat, especially dilution effects caused by possible variation at orthologous loci. However, there is little current understanding of the underlying genetics of suppression. The discovery of suppression in some wheat genotypes of the cereal rye chromosome 1RS-derived gene Pm8 for powdery mildew resistance offered an opportunity for analysis. A single gene for suppression was identified at or near the closely linked storage protein genes Gli-A1 and Glu-A3, which are also closely associated with the Pm3 locus on chromosome 1AS. The Pm3 locus is a complex of expressed alleles and pseudogenes embedded among Glu-A3 repeats. In the current report, we explain why earlier work indicated that the mildew suppressor was closely associated with specific Gli-A1 and Glu-A3 alleles, and predict that suppression of Pm8 involves translated gene products from the Pm3 locus.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred means of control of the disease. The winter wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 54 has high-temperature resistance to stripe rust. To identify genes for stripe rust resistance, Xiaoyan 54 was crossed with Mingxian 169, a winter wheat genotype susceptible to all Chinese races of the pathogen. Seedlings and adult plants of the parents and F(1), F(2), F(3) and F(4) progeny were tested with Chinese race CYR32 under controlled greenhouse conditions and in the field. Xiaoyan 54 has two recessive resistance genes, designated as Yrxy1 and Yrxy2, conferring high-temperature resistance. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were used to identify molecular markers flanking Yrxy2 using 181 plants from one segregating F(3) line. A total of nine markers, two of which flanked the locus at genetic distances of 4.0 and 6.4 cM on the long arm of chromosome 2A were identified. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and SSR techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to Yrxy1. A linkage group of nine RGAP and two SSR markers was constructed for Yrxy1 using 177 plants of another segregating F(3) line. Two RGAP markers were closely linked to the locus with genetic distances of 2.3 and 3.5 cM. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with RGAP markers M8 and M9 and the two SSR markers located Yrxy1 on the short arm of chromosome 7A. The SSR markers Xbarc49 and Xwmc422 were 15.8 and 26.1 cM, respectively, from the gene. The closely linked molecular markers should be useful for incorporating the resistance genes into commercial cultivars and combining them with other genes for stripe rust resistance.

AB The small annual grass Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is rapidly emerging as a powerful model system to study questions unique to the grasses. Many Brachypodium resources have been developed including a whole genome sequence, highly efficient transformation and a large germplasm collection. We developed a genetic linkage map of Brachypodium using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and an F(2) mapping population of 476 individuals. SNPs were identified by targeted resequencing of single copy genomic sequences. Using the Illumina GoldenGate Genotyping platform we placed 558 markers into five linkage groups corresponding to the five chromosomes of Brachypodium. The unusually long total genetic map length, 1,598 centiMorgans (cM), indicates that the Brachypodium mapping population has a high recombination rate. By comparing the genetic map to genome features we found that the recombination rate was positively correlated with gene density and negatively correlated with repetitive regions and sites of ancestral chromosome fusions that retained centromeric repeat sequences. A comparison of adjacent genome regions with high versus low recombination rates revealed a positive correlation between interspecific synteny and recombination rate.

AB Like all plants, potato has evolved a surveillance system consisting of a large array of genes encoding for immune receptors that confer resistance to pathogens and pests. The majority of these so-called resistance or R proteins belong to the super-family that harbour a nucleotide binding and a leucine-rich-repeat domain (NB-LRR). Here, sequence information of the conserved NB domain was used to investigate the genome-wide genetic distribution of the NB-LRR resistance gene loci in potato. We analysed the sequences of 288 unique BAC clones selected using filter hybridisation screening of a BAC library of the diploid potato clone RH89-039-16 (S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum) and a physical map of this BAC library. This resulted in the identification of 738 partial and full-length NB-LRR sequences. Based on homology of these sequences with known resistance genes, 280 and 448 sequences were classified as TIR-NB-LRR (TNL) and CC-NB-LRR (CNL) sequences, respectively. Genetic mapping revealed the presence of 15 TNL and 32 CNL loci. Thirty-six are novel, while three TNL loci and eight CNL loci are syntenic with previously identified functional resistance genes. The genetic map was complemented with 68 universal CAPS markers and 82 disease resistance trait loci described in literature, providing an excellent template for genetic studies and applied research in potato.

AB Worldwide maize is the second major agricultural commodity and around one-fourth is currently biotech, with significant application of the insect resistant event MON810 particularly in the European Union. Grains are the major commercialized part of the plant, and can be harvested after maturity (for food and feed purposes) or at late milky-starchy stage (for forage uses, with the whole plant). We assessed possible proteomic unintended effects of the MON810 transgene using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. To keep in a realistic scenario we used plants grown in agricultural fields in a region where similar to 50% of maize was MON810, and analyzed grains at milky-starchy stage. In maize, differential transcripts and metabolites between GM and comparable non-GM varieties tend to be variety specific. Thus, we analyzed two variety pairs, DKC6575/Tietar and PR33P67/PR33P66 which are considered representative of Food and Agriculture Organization 700 and 600 varieties commercially grown in the region. MON810 and non-GM milky-starchy grains had virtually identical proteomic patterns, with a very small number of spots showing fold-variations in the 1-1.8 range. They were all variety specific and had divergent identities and functions. Although 2DE allows the analysis of a limited dataset our results support substantial equivalence between MON810 and comparable non-GM varieties.

TI Agrobacterium-Mediated Virus-Induced Gene Silencing Assay In Cotton
SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Considerable efforts have been made on molecular breeding of new varieties. The large-scale gene functional analysis in cotton has been lagged behind most of the modern plant species, likely due to its large size of genome, gene duplication and polyploidy, long growth cycle and recalcitrance to genetic transformation1. To facilitate high throughput functional genetic/genomic study in cotton, we attempt to develop rapid and efficient transient assays to assess cotton gene functions.
   Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) is a powerful technique that was developed based on the host Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS) to repress viral proliferation2,3. Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS has been successfully applied in a wide range of dicots species such as Solanaceae, Arabidopsis and legume species, and monocots species including barley, wheat and maize, for various functional genomic studies3,4. As this rapid and efficient approach avoids plant transformation and overcomes functional redundancy, it is particularly attractive and suitable for functional genomic study in crop species like cotton not amenable for transformation.
   In this study, we report the detailed protocol of Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS system in cotton. Among the several viral VIGS vectors, the tobacco rattle virus (TRV) invades a wide range of hosts and is able to spread vigorously throughout the entire plant yet produce mild symptoms on the hosts5. To monitor the silencing efficiency, GrCLA1, a homolog gene of Arabidopsis Cloroplastos alterados 1 gene (AtCLA1) in cotton, has been cloned and inserted into the VIGS binary vector pYL156. CLA1 gene is involved in chloroplast development6, and previous studies have shown that loss-of-function of AtCLA1 resulted in an albino phenotype on true leaves7, providing an excellent visual marker for silencing efficiency. At approximately two weeks post Agrobacterium infiltration, the albino phenotype started to appear on the true leaves, with 100% silencing efficiency in all replicated experiments. The silencing of endogenous gene expression was also confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Significantly, silencing could potently occur in all the cultivars we tested, including various commercially grown varieties in Texas. This rapid and efficient Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS assay provides a very powerful tool for rapid large-scale analysis of gene functions at genome-wide level in cotton.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum) gene Lr12 provides adult-plant race-specific resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. It is completely linked or identical to Lr31, which confers seedling resistance only when the complementary gene Lr27 is also present. F(2) and F(2)-derived F(3) families were developed from a cross between the susceptible variety Thatcher and TcLr12, an isoline carrying Lr12. Of 230 F(3) families, 55 were homozygous resistant, 115 were segregating for resistance, and 60 were susceptible to P. triticina, fitting a monogenic 1:2:1 segregation ratio. Lr12 was mapped on chromosome arm 4BL and was flanked by markers Xgwm251 and Xgwm149 at distances of 0.9 and 1.9 cM, respectively. Using linked markers and wheat deletion stocks, Lr12 was located in deletion bin 4BL-5, FL = 0.86-1.0, comprising the terminal 14% of 4BL. The markers will be useful for following Lr12/Lr31 in crosses and for further mapping studies.

AB Drought stress is one of the most important environmental factors that limit plant growth and development, thus reducing yield. The objective of the present research was to correlate the genetic structure of different Fragaria genotypes, as assessed by Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers, and plant responses to drought stress. Firstly, physiological parameters related to the plant response to drought stress such as leaf relative water content (RWC) and water losing rate (WLR) were measured. WLR and RWC were compared for 20 cultivars of the octaploid Fragaria x ananassa, two ecotypes of the diploid species F. vesca and one octaploid species F. chiloensis. These parameters could discriminate genotypes showing a contrasting response to water stress. Secondly, AFLP and ESTs were compared in terms of their information content and efficiency in the study of genetic diversity and relationships among these 23 Fragaria genotypes. To evaluate the genetic basis for the observed variation in the measured physiological parameter, the effect of specific AFLP/EST loci on WLR and RWC for the different Fragaria genotypes was quantified by Kruskal-Wallis analysis. By Mantel testing, the hierarchical clustering of the Fragaria genotypes based on associated EST or AFLP markers was compared to the observed eco-physiological relevant grouping. A better discriminating capacity for associated markers was noted, enabling a functional marker selection approach to screen the strawberry gene pool for drought tolerance. Correlation of EST markers to leaf RWC and WLR enforces them as potential candidate genes in control of plant responses to drought stress in Fragaria sp.

AB Dwarfing genes play an important role in improving yield and adaptability of wheat cultivars in most production environments. Understanding the allelic distribution at dwarfing loci is very important for any wheat-breeding programmes. In this study, we reported the allelic constitution at microsatellite locus Xgwm261 and the two major height-reducing genes Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 among a set of 56 bread wheat cultivars and nine landraces, based on diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assays. With respect to Rht-B1, 37% of the accessions carried the dwarfing allele Rht-B1b, while at Rht-D1, only one accession carried the dwarfing allele Rht-D1b. The allelic state at Rht8 was assayed indirectly by genotyping for the linked microsatellite locus Xgwm261. About 26% of the accessions carried the 192 bp allele (linked with Rht8 gene in some cases), whereas 35 and 12% genotypes carried 165 and 174 bp allele at the microsatellite locus Xgwm261. Cultivars released from 1980 onwards increasingly carried either Rht-B1b or Rht8. This information should allow for a more rational use of this collection for the purpose of wheat improvement in Turkey.

AB Vanda Mimi Palmer (VMP) is a highly sought as fragrant-orchid hybrid in Malaysia. It is economically important in cosmetic and beauty industries and also a famous potted ornamental plant. To date, no work on fragrance-related genes of vandaceous orchids has been reported from other research groups although the analysis of floral fragrance or volatiles have been extensively studied. An expressed sequence tag (EST) resource was developed for VMP principally to mine any potential fragrance-related expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) for future development as markers in the identification of fragrant vandaceous orchids endemic to Malaysia. Clustering, annotation and assembling of the ESTs identified 1,196 unigenes which defined 966 singletons and 230 contigs. The VMP dbEST was functionally classified by gene ontology (GO) into three groups: molecular functions (51.2%), cellular components (16.4%) and biological processes (24.6%) while the remaining 7.8% showed no hits with GO identifier. A total of 112 EST-SSR (9.4%) was mined on which at least five units of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, or hexa-nucleotide repeats were predicted. The di-nucleotide motif repeats appeared to be the most frequent repeats among the detected SSRs with the AT/TA types as the most abundant among the dimerics, while AAG/TTC, AGA/TCT-type were the most frequent trimerics. The mined EST-SSR is believed to be useful in the development of EST-SSR markers that is applicable in the screening and characterization of fragrance-related transcripts in closely related species.

AB Soybean is a major crop that is an important source of oil and proteins. A number of genetic linkage maps have been developed in soybean. Specifically, hundreds of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed and mapped. Recent sequencing of the soybean genome resulted in the generation of vast amounts of genetic information. The objectives of this investigation were to use SSR markers in developing a connection between genetic and physical maps and to determine the physical distribution of recombination on soybean chromosomes. A total of 2,188 SSRs were used for sequence-based physical localization on soybean chromosomes. Linkage information was used from different maps to create an integrated genetic map. Comparison of the integrated genetic linkage maps and sequence based physical maps revealed that the distal 25% of each chromosome was the most marker-dense, containing an average of 47.4% of the SSR markers and 50.2% of the genes. The proximal 25% of each chromosome contained only 7.4% of the markers and 6.7% of the genes. At the whole genome level, the marker density and gene density showed a high correlation (R-2) of 0.64 and 0.83, respectively with the physical distance from the centromere. Recombination followed a similar pattern with comparisons indicating that recombination is high in telomeric regions, though the correlation between crossover frequency and distance from the centromeres is low (R-2 = 0.21). Most of the centromeric regions were low in recombination. The crossover frequency for the entire soybean genome was 7.2%, with extremes much higher and lower than average. The number of recombination hotspots varied from 1 to 12 per chromosome. A high correlation of 0.83 between the distribution of SSR markers and genes suggested close association of SSRs with genes. The knowledge of distribution of recombination on chromosomes may be applied in characterizing and targeting genes.

TI Introgression of Chromosome 3Ns from Psathyrostachys huashanica into

AB Wheat stripe rust is a destructive disease in the cool and humid wheat-growing areas of the world. Finding diverse sources of stripe rust resistance is critical for increasing genetic diversity of resistance for wheat breeding programs. Stripe rust resistance was identified in the alien species Psathyrostachys huashanica, and a wheat- P. huashanica amphiploid line (PHWSA) with stripe rust resistance was reported previously. In this study, a P. huashanica 3Ns monosomic addition line (PW11) with superior resistance to stripe rust was developed, which was derived from the cross between PHW-SA and wheat J-11. We evaluated the alien introgressions PW11-2, PW11-5 and PW11-8 which were derived from line PW11 for reaction to new Pst race CYR32, and used molecular and cytogenetic tools to characterize these lines. The introgressions were remarkably resistant to CYR32, suggesting that the resistance to stripe rust of the introgressions thus was controlled by gene(s) located on P. huashanica chromosome 3Ns. All derived lines were cytologically stable in term of meiotic chromosome behavior. Two 3Ns chromosomes of P. huashanica were detected in the disomic addition line PW11-2. Chromosomes 1B of substitution line PW11-5 had been replaced by a pair of P. huashanica 3Ns chromosomes. In PW11-8, a small terminal segment from P. huashanica chromosome arm 3NsS was translocated to the terminal region of wheat chromosomes 3BL. Thus, this translocated chromosome is designated T3BL-3NsS. These conclusions were further confirmed by SSR analyses. Two 3Ns-specific markers Xgwm181 and Xgwm161 will be useful to rapidly identify and trace the translocated fragments. These introgressions, which had significant characteristics of resistance to stripe rust, could be utilized as novel germplasms for wheat breeding.

AB Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), the Hessian fly, is distributed across most of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-growing areas of the world and can cause significant yield losses in wheat production. Native to the Old World, Hessian fly reportedly came to the United States in a single introduction during the Revolutionary War and has since spread across North America. Using a nuclear marker, the population structure of North American Hessian fly was examined with regard to collections from the Old World. White intron 1 (wint1) showed insignificant recombination within collections and a large number of informative characters, allowing its use as a phylogenetic marker. Thirty-three alleles of wint1 were identified. Population structure analyses divided the collections into four populations: Middle East, Old World I, Old World II, and New World. More variation was found within populations than between populations, indicating that gene flow exists between local areas. However, shared ancestral characteristics resulted in mixing of Hessian fly collections into more than one population as revealed by the population structure reconstruction. North American and Spanish collections were a mixture of the Old and New World populations. With the sharing of ancestral characters as well as wint1 alleles, this study indicates that the North American lineage may actually be associated to an unsampled location, perhaps northern Europe. If the single introduction hypothesis were correct, then both lineages would have to have been present at the time of introduction.

AB Flour and dough quality are very important breeding traits for wheat (Triticum aestivum L) the selection of which would benefit from linked molecular markers. Association analysis allows the identification of genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to target traits. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the availability of a densely genotyped population with large genetic variability for the traits of interest. Our objective was to identify chromosomal regions associated with flour and dough quality traits using a core collection built by maximizing the genetic diversity and phenotypic variability. We investigated the association of DArT, SSR and SNP markers with grain protein content, grain hardness, water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) viscosity, wholemeal flour color and dough rheology.
   Out of 803 markers tested, 130 markers spread over the genome were associated with at least one trait, varying from 20 associated with WEAX viscosity to 60 associated with dough quality. Most chromosome regions known to determine wheat quality from the study of several bi-parental recombinant inbred lines were confirmed here and some new regions were identified. Associations were found for each trait studied, demonstrating that the core collection is a useful tool for QTL association mapping of these and other traits of interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study reports the discovery and molecular mapping of a resistance gene effective against stem rust races RKQQC and TTKSK (Ug99) derived from Aegilops geniculata (2n = 4x = 28, U(g)U(g)M(g)M(g)). Two populations from the crosses TA5599 (T5DL-5M(g)L center dot 5M(g)S)/TA3809 (ph1b mutant in Chinese Spring background) and TA5599/Lakin were developed and used for genetic mapping to identify markers linked to the resistance gene. Further molecular and cytogenetic characterization resulted in the identification of nine spontaneous recombinants with shortened Ae. geniculata segments. Three of the wheat-Ae. geniculata recombinants (U6154-124, U6154-128, and U6200-113) are interstitial translocations (T5DS center dot 5DL-5M(g)L-5DL), with 20-30% proximal segments of 5M(g)L translocated to 5DL; the other six are recombinants (T5DL-5M(g)L center dot 5M(g)S) have shortened segments of 5M(g)L with fraction lengths (FL) of 0.32-0.45 compared with FL 0.55 for the 5M(g)L segment in the original translocation donor, TA5599. Recombinants U6200-64, U6200-117, and U6154-124 carry the stem rust resistance gene Sr53 with the same infection type as TA5599, the resistance gene donor. All recombinants were confirmed to be genetically compensating on the basis of genomic in situ hybridization and molecular marker analysis with chromosome 5D- and 5M(g)-specific SSR/STS-PCR markers. These recombinants between wheat and Ae. geniculata will provide another source for wheat stem rust resistance breeding and for physical mapping of the resistance locus and crossover hot spots between wheat chromosome 5D and chromosome 5M(g)L of Ae. geniculata.

AB We investigated the compositional and structural differences in sequences derived from different fractions of wheat genomic DNA obtained using methylation filtration and C(0)t fractionation. Comparative analysis of these sequences revealed large compositional and structural variations in terms of GC content, different structural elements including repeat sequences (e. g., transposable elements and simple sequence repeats), protein coding genes, and non-coding RNA genes. A correlation between methylation status [determined on the basis of selective inclusion/exclusion in methylation-filtered (MF) library] of different repeat elements and expression level was observed. The expression levels were determined by comparing MF sequences with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in the public domain. Only a limited overlap among MF, high C(0)t (HC), and ESTs was observed, suggesting that these sequences may largely either represent the low-copy non-transcribed sequences or include genes with low expression levels. Thus, these results indicated a need to study MF and HC sequences along with ESTs to fully appreciate complexity of wheat gene space.

AB In contrast to animals, the life cycle of higher plants alternates between a gamete-producing (gametophyte) and a spore-producing (sporophyte) generation. The female gametophyte of angiosperms consists of four distinct cell types, including two gametes, the egg and the central cell, which give rise to embryo and endosperm, respectively. Based on a combined subtractive hybridization and virtual subtraction approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we have isolated a class of transcription factors not found in animal genomes, the RKD (RWP-RK domain-containing) factors, which share a highly conserved RWP-RK domain. Single-cell RT-PCR revealed that the genes TaRKD1 and TaRKD2 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell of wheat. The Arabidopsis genome contains five RKD genes, at least two of them, AtRKD1 and AtRKD2, are preferentially expressed in the egg cell of Arabidopsis. Ectopic expression of the AtRKD1 and AtRKD2 genes induces cell proliferation and the expression of an egg cell marker. Analyses of RKD-induced proliferating cells exhibit a shift of gene expression towards an egg cell-like transcriptome. Promoters of selected RKD-induced genes were shown to be predominantly active in the egg cell and can be activated by RKD in a transient protoplast expression assay. The data show that egg cell-specific RKD factors control a transcriptional program, which is characteristic for plant egg cells.

AB Polyploidization is an important speciation mechanism for all eukaryotes, and it has profound impacts on biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been used as an effective marker to visually screen somatic hybrids at an early stage in protoplast fusion. We have previously reported that the intensity of GFP fluorescence of regenerated embryoids was also an early indicator of ploidy level. However, little is known concerning the effects of ploidy increase on the GFP expression in citrus somatic hybrids at the plant level. Herein, allotetraploid and diploid cybrid plants with enhanced GFP (EGFP) expression were regenerated from the fusion of embryogenic callus protoplasts from 'Murcott' tangor (Citrus reticulata Blanco x Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) and mesophyll protoplasts from transgenic 'Valencia' orange (C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck) expressing the EGFP gene, via electrofusion. Subsequent simple sequence repeat (SSR), chloroplast simple sequence repeat and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence analysis revealed that the two regenerated tetraploid plants were true allotetraploid somatic hybrids possessing nuclear genomic DNA of both parents and cytoplasmic DNA from the callus parent, while the five regenerated diploid plants were cybrids containing nuclear DNA of the leaf parent and with complex segregation of cytoplasmic DNA. Furthermore, EGFP expression was compared in cells and protoplasts from mature leaves of these diploid cybrids and allotetraploid somatic hybrids. Results showed that the intensity of GFP fluorescence per cell or protoplast in diploid was generally brighter than in allotetraploid. Moreover, same hybridization signal was detected on allotetraploid and diploid plants by Southern blot analysis. By real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, GFP expression level of the diploid cybrid was revealed significantly higher than that of the allotetraploid somatic hybrid. These results suggest that ploidy level conversion can affect transgene expression and citrus diploid cybrid and allotetraploid somatic hybrid represents another example of gene regulation coupled to ploidy.

AB Mycosphaerella graminicola populations were examined in France with microsatellite markers and PCR-SSCP analysis of partial actin and beta-tubulin encoding sequences. A total of 363 isolates was sampled in 2005 from 17 provinces, and genotypes from corresponding strains were characterized. Unique haplotypes comprised 84% of the population, and gene diversity was high nationwide (0.70) and locally. A moderate genetic differentiation (G(ST) = 0.18) was found and indicated that in France the M. graminicola population was more structured than in other previously studied European countries. Bayesian structure analysis identified three genetic clusters distributed among the 17 provinces. Our results highlighted the potential for the adaptation of the fungus to local conditions, leading to genetic clusters among the French population of the fungus as well as genotype flow between regional clusters.

AB Leaf rust resistance gene Lr58 derived from Aegilops triuncialis L. was transferred to the hard red winter wheat (HRWW) cultivars Jagger and Overley by standard backcrossing and marker-assisted selection (MAS). A co-dominant PCR-based sequence tagged site (STS) marker was developed based on the sequence information of the RFLP marker (XksuH16) diagnostically detecting the alien segment in T2BS center dot 2BL-2(t)L(0.95). STS marker Xncw-Lr58-1 was used to select backcross F-1 plants with rust resistance. The co-dominant marker polymorphism detected by primer pair NCW-Lr58-1 efficiently identified the homozygous BC3F2 plants with rust resistance gene Lr58. The STS marker Xncw-Lr58-1 showed consistent diagnostic polymorphism between the resistant source and the wheat cultivars selected by the US Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Project. The utility and compatibility of the STS marker in MAS programs involving robust genotyping platforms was demonstrated in both agarose-based and capillary-based platforms. Screening backcross derivatives carrying Lr58 with various rust races at seedling stage suggested the transferred rust resistance in adapted winter wheats is stable in both cultivar backgrounds. Lr58 in adapted winter wheat backgrounds could be used in combination with other resistance genes in wheat rust resistance breeding.

AB Allele composition at the major growth habit (Ppd-D1, Vrn-1, Rht-1 and Rht8) loci was determined in 52 Bulgarian bread wheat cultivars and landraces, using recently developed diagnostic molecular markers. The study showed that Bulgarian wheat germplasm varies for photoperiod, vernalization and height-reducing genes. The photoperiod-sensitive allele (Ppd-D1b) was the most frequent one in the old cultivars and landraces (90.9%), while the photoperiod-insensitive allele (Ppd-D1a) showed the highest frequency in the modern cultivars (96.71%). The alleles conferring winter growth habit (vrn-A1, vrn-B1 and vrn-D1) were more common in both the old (72.7%) and the modern (93.3%) wheat genotypes. The spring allele Vrn-A1c was not detected in Bulgarian germplasm, while the spring allele Vrn-B1 was found only in the old genotypes (13.6%). The semi-dwarfing allele Rht-B1b was observed in several modern cultivars. Seven allele variants were found in the microsatellite locus Xgwm261, closely located to the Rht8 gene. Among them, alleles of 164, 212 and 216 bp length were specific for the old genotypes studied, while alleles of 192 and 202 bp length were specific for the modern ones. The allele combination Rht-B1b//192 or 202 bp allele (Xgwm261 locus)//Ppd-D1a//vrn-A1/vrn-B1/vrn-D1 was detected in most of the early-heading modern cultivars. Our study emphasizes on the plasticity of the adaptive response of bread wheat cultivars sown in Bulgaria, as well as on the effect of variation for major growth habit on some yield and reproductive characteristics.

AB The genome sequences of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon and the comprehensive Triticeae EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) resources provide invaluable information for comparative genomics analysis. The powdery mildew resistance gene, Pm6, which was introgressed into common wheat from Triticum timopheevii, was previously mapped to the wheat chromosome bin of 2BL [fraction length (FL) 0.50-1.00] with limited DNA markers. In this study, we saturated the Pm6 locus in wheat using the collinearity-based markers by extensively exploiting these genomic resources. All wheat ESTs located in the bin 2BL FL 0.50-1.00 and their corresponding orthologous genes on rice chromosome 4 were firstly used to develop STS (Sequence Tagged Site) markers. Those identified markers that flanked the Pm6 locus were then used to identify the collinear regions in the genomes of rice and Brachypodium. Triticeae ESTs with orthologous genes in these collinear regions were further used to develop new conserved markers for the fine mapping of Pm6. Using two F-2 populations derived from crosses of IGVI-465 x Prins and IGVI-466 x Prins, we mapped a total of 29 markers to the Pm6 locus. Among them, 14 markers were co-segregated with Pm6 in the IGVI-466/Prins population. Comparative genome analysis showed that the collinear region of the 29 linked markers covers a similar to 5.6-Mb region in chromosome 5L of Brachypodium and a similar to 6.0-Mb region in chromosome 4L of rice. The marker order is conserved between rice and Brachypodium, but re-arrangements are present in wheat. Comparative mapping in the two populations showed that two conserved markers (CINAU123 and CINAU127) flanked the Pm6 locus, and an LRR-receptor-like protein kinase cluster was identified in the collinear regions of Brachypodium and rice. This putative resistance gene cluster provides a potential target site for further fine mapping and cloning of Pm6. Moreover, the newly developed conserved markers closely linked to Pm6 can be used for the marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Pm6 in wheat breeding programs.

AB While many reports on genetic analysis of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in bread wheat have been published during the past decade, only limited information is available on FHB resistance derived from wheat relatives. In this contribution, we report on the genetic analysis of FHB resistance derived from Triticum macha (Georgian spelt wheat). As the origin of T. macha is in the Caucasian region, it is supposed that its FHB resistance differs from other well-investigated resistance sources. To introduce valuable alleles from the landrace T. macha into a modern genetic background, we adopted an advanced backcross QTL mapping scheme. A backcross-derived recombinant-inbred line population of 321 BC(2)F(3) lines was developed from a cross of T. macha with the Austrian winter wheat cultivar Furore. The population was evaluated for Fusarium resistance in seven field experiments during four seasons using artificial inoculations. A total of 300 lines of the population were genetically fingerprinted using SSR and AFLP markers. The resulting linkage map covered 33 linkage groups with 560 markers. Five novel FHB-resistance QTL, all descending from T. macha, were found on four chromosomes (2A, 2B, 5A, 5B). Several QTL for morphological and developmental traits were mapped in the same population, which partly overlapped with FHB-resistance QTL. Only the 2BL FHB-resistance QTL co-located with a plant height QTL. The largest-effect FHB-resistance QTL in this population mapped at the spelt-type locus on chromosome 5A and was associated with the wild-type allele q, but it is unclear whether q has a pleiotropic effect on FHB resistance or is closely linked to a nearby resistance QTL.

AB The ortholog of the human gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic, filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum by shared amino acid sequence, protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature fungal protein. The Fusarium Npc1 gene shares 34% amino acid sequence identity and 51% similarity to the human gene, has similar domain structure and is constitutively expressed, although up-regulated in ungerminated macroconidia and ascospores. GFP-tagged Npc1p localizes to the fungal vacuolar membrane. Cultures derived from a Delta npc1 mutant strain contain significantly more ergosterol than cultures of the wildtype. Staining with the fluorescent, sterol binding dye filipin, shows that ergosterol accumulates in vacuoles of the Delta npc1 mutant but not the wildtype strain. The Delta npc1 mutant has a temperature dependent reduction in growth and greater sensitivity to the ergosterol synthesis inhibiting fungicide tebuconazole compared with the wildtype strain or the mutant complemented with wildtype Npc1. The mutant also is significantly reduced in pathogenicity to wheat. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that Npc1p is important for normal transport of ergosterol from the vacuole and is essential for proper membrane function under particular environmental conditions.

AB Background: In the last few years, efforts have been made to identify large effect QTL for grain yield under drought in rice. However, identification of most precise and consistent QTL across the environments and genetics backgrounds is essential for their successful use in Marker-assisted Selection. In this study, an attempt was made to locate consistent QTL regions associated with yield increase under drought by applying a genome-wide QTL meta-analysis approach.
   Results: The integration of 15 maps resulted in a consensus map with 531 markers and a total map length of 1821 cM. Fifty-three yield QTL reported in 15 studies were projected on a consensus map and meta-analysis was performed. Fourteen meta-QTL were obtained on seven chromosomes. MQTL(1.2), MQTL(1.3), MQTL(1.4), and MQTL(12.1) were around 700 kb and corresponded to a reasonably small genetic distance of 1.8 to 5 cM and they are suitable for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). The meta-QTL for grain yield under drought coincided with at least one of the meta-QTL identified for root and leaf morphology traits under drought in earlier reports. Validation of major-effect QTL on a panel of random drought-tolerant lines revealed the presence of at least one major QTL in each line. DTY(12.1) was present in 85% of the lines, followed by DTY(4.1) in 79% and DTY(1.1) in 64% of the lines. Comparative genomics of meta-QTL with other cereals revealed that the homologous regions of MQTL(1.4) and MQTL(3.2) had QTL for grain yield under drought in maize, wheat, and barley respectively. The genes in the meta-QTL regions were analyzed by a comparative genomics approach and candidate genes were deduced for grain yield under drought. Three groups of genes such as stress-inducible genes, growth and development-related genes, and sugar transport-related genes were found in clusters in most of the meta-QTL.
   Conclusions: Meta-QTL with small genetic and physical intervals could be useful in Marker-assisted selection individually and in combinations. Validation and comparative genomics of the major-effect QTL confirmed their consistency within and across the species. The shortlisted candidate genes can be cloned to unravel the molecular mechanism regulating grain yield under drought.

TI Prebiotic Effects of Wheat Arabinoxylan Related to the Increase in

AB Background: Alterations in the composition of gut microbiota - known as dysbiosis - has been proposed to contribute to the development of obesity, thereby supporting the potential interest of nutrients targeting the gut with beneficial effect for host adiposity. We test the ability of a specific concentrate of water-extractable high molecular weight arabinoxylans (AX) from wheat to modulate both the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Mice were fed either a control diet (CT) or a HF diet, or a HF diet supplemented with AX (10% w/w) during 4 weeks. AX supplementation restored the number of bacteria that were decreased upon HF feeding, i.e. Bacteroides-Prevotella spp. and Roseburia spp. Importantly, AX treatment markedly increased caecal bifidobacteria content, in particular Bifidobacterium animalis lactis. This effect was accompanied by improvement of gut barrier function and by a lower circulating inflammatory marker. Interestingly, rumenic acid (C18:2 c9,t11) was increased in white adipose tissue due to AX treatment, suggesting the influence of gut bacterial metabolism on host tissue. In parallel, AX treatment decreased adipocyte size and HF diet-induced expression of genes mediating differentiation, fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation and inflammation, and decreased a key lipogenic enzyme activity in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Furthermore, AX treatment significantly decreased HF-induced adiposity, body weight gain, serum and hepatic cholesterol accumulation and insulin resistance. Correlation analysis reveals that Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides/Prevotella levels inversely correlate with these host metabolic parameters.
   Conclusions/Significance: Supplementation of a concentrate of water-extractable high molecular weight AX in the diet counteracted HF-induced gut dysbiosis together with an improvement of obesity and lipid-lowering effects. We postulate that hypocholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effects are related to changes in gut microbiota. These data support a role for wheat AX as interesting nutrients with prebiotic properties related to obesity prevention.

AB Wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) race TTKSK (Ug99), with virulence to the majority of the world's wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars, has spread from Uganda throughout eastern Africa, Yemen, and Iran. The identification and spread of variants of race TTKSK with virulence to additional stem rust resistance genes has reminded breeders and pathologists of the danger of deploying major resistance genes alone. In order to protect wheat from this rapidly spreading and adapting pathogen, multiple resistance genes are needed, preferably from improved germplasm. Preliminary screening of over 700 spring wheat breeding lines and cultivars developed at least 20 years ago identified 88 accessions with field resistance to Ug99. We included these resistant accessions in the stem rust screening nursery in Njoro, Kenya for two additional seasons. The accessions were also screened with a bulk of North American isolates of P. graminis f. sp. tritici in the field in St. Paul, MN. In order to further characterize the resistance in these accessions, we obtained seedling phenotypes for 10 races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, including two races from the race TTKSK complex. This phenotyping led to the identification of accessions with either adult-plant or all-stage resistance to race TTKSK, and often North American races of P graminis f. sp. tritici as well. These Ug99 resistant accessions can be obtained by breeders and introgressed into current breeding germplasm.

AB Sucrose non-fermenting1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) plays a key role in plant stress signaling transduction pathways. In this study, one copy of TaSnRK2.7, a SnRK2 member of common wheat, was isolated and characterized for nucleotide diversity among 45 wheat accessions with different stress-response features. Most of the accessions were elite wheat cultivars, which had been subject to population bottlenecks and intensive selection during breeding. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity across the entire TaSnRK2.7-A region was 0.00076 and 0.590, respectively, and diversity in non-coding regions was higher than that in coding regions. Sliding-window analysis showed variable levels of nucleotide variation along the entire TaSnRK2.7-A region; the sixth intron and ninth exon represented variation-enriched regions. As predicted, neutrality tests revealed that population bottlenecks or purifying selection had acted on the TaSnRK2.7-A gene, a relatively conserved gene. Furthermore, strong linkage disequilibrium between SNP loci extends across the entire TaSnRK2.7-A region. These findings demonstrate that the TaSnRK2.7-A genomic region has evolved under extensive selection pressure during crop breeding.

AB A doubled haploid (DH) barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) population of 334 lines (ND24260 x Flagship) genotyped with DArT markers was used to map genes for adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia hordei Otth) under Weld conditions in Australia and Uruguay. The Australian barley cultivar Flagship carries an APR gene (qRphFlag) derived from the cultivar Vada. Association analysis and composite interval mapping identified two genes conferring APR in this DH population. qRphFlag was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5H (5HS), accounting for 64-85% of the phenotypic variation across four Weld environments and 56% under controlled environmental conditions (CEC). A second quantitative trait locus (QTL) from ND24260 (qRphND) with smaller effect was mapped to chromosome 6HL. In the absence of qRphFlag, qRphND conferred only a low level of resistance. DH lines displaying the highest level of APR carried both genes. Sequence information for the critical DArT marker bPb-0837 (positioned at 21.2 cM on chromosome 5HS) was used to develop bPb-0837-PCR, a simple PCR-based marker for qRphFlag. The 245 bp fragment for bPb-0837-PCR was detected in a range of barley cultivars known to possess APR, which was consistent with previous tests of allelism, demonstrating that the qRphFlag resistant allele is common in leaf rust resistant cultivars derived from Vada and Emir. qRphFlag has been designated Rph20, the first gene conferring APR to P. hordei to be characterised in barley. The PCR marker will likely be effective in marker-assisted selection for Rph20.

AB Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is an economically important pathogen of barley, which may become even more important due to global warming. In barley, several loci conferring tolerance to BYDV-PAV-ASL-1 are known, e.g. Ryd2, Ryd3 and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 2H. The aim of the present study was to get information whether the level of tolerance against this isolate of BYDV in barley can be improved by combining these loci. Therefore, a winter and a spring barley population of doubled haploid (DH) lines were genotyped by molecular markers for the presence of the susceptibility or the resistance encoding allele at respective loci (Ryd2, Ryd3, QTL on chromosome 2H) and were tested for their level of BYDV-tolerance after inoculation with viruliferous (BYDV-PAV-ASL-1) aphids in Weld trials. In DH-lines carrying the combination Ryd2 and Ryd3, a significant reduction of the virus titre was detected as compared to lines carrying only one of these genes. Furthermore, spring barley DH-lines with this allele combination also showed a significantly higher relative grain yield as compared to lines carrying only Ryd2 or Ryd3. The QTL on chromosome 2H had only a small effect on the level of tolerance in those lines carrying only Ryd2, or Ryd3 or a combination of both, but the effect in comparison to lines carrying no tolerance allele was significant. Overall, these results show that the combination of Ryd2 and Ryd3 leads to quantitative resistance against BYDV-PAV instead of tolerance.

AB Orchardgrass, or cocksfoot [Dactylis glomerata (L.)], has been naturalized on nearly every continent and is a commonly used species for forage and hay production. All major cultivated varieties of orchardgrass are autotetraploid, and few tools or information are available for functional and comparative genetic analyses and improvement of the species. To improve the genetic resources for orchardgrass, we have developed an EST library and SSR markers from salt, drought, and cold stressed tissues. The ESTs were bi-directionally sequenced from clones and combined into 17,373 unigenes. Unigenes were annotated based on putative orthology to genes from rice, Triticeae grasses, other Poaceae, Arabidopsis, and the non-redundant database of the NCBI. Of 1,162 SSR markers developed, approximately 80% showed amplification products across a set of orchardgrass germplasm, and 40% across related Festuca and Lolium species. When orchardgrass subspecies were genotyped using 33 SSR markers their within-accession similarity values ranged from 0.44 to 0.71, with Mediterranean accessions having a higher similarity. The total number of genotyped bands was greater for tetraploid accessions compared to diploid accessions. Clustering analysis indicated grouping of Mediterranean subspecies and central Asian subspecies, while the D. glomerata ssp. aschersoniana was closest related to three cultivated varieties.

AB A mapping population of 186 recombinant inbred lines developed from a cross between UC1110, an adapted California spring wheat, and PI610750, a synthetic derivative from CIMMYT's Wide Cross Program, was evaluated for its response to current California races of stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) in replicated field trials over four seasons (2007-2010) in the northern Sacramento Valley. A genetic map was constructed consisting of 1,494 polymorphic probes (SSRs, DArTs, and ESTs) mapped to 558 unique loci, and QTL analysis revealed the presence of four stripe rust resistance QTL segregating in this population, two from UC1110 (on chromosomes 3BS and 2BS) and two from PI610750 (5AL and 2AS). The two QTL of largest effects (on 3BS and 5AL) were validated in independent populations and their intervals narrowed to 2.5 and 5.3 cM, respectively. The 3BS QTL was shown, by allelism test and genotype, to carry a gene different from the Yr30/Sr2 complex. Mapped position also suggests that the 3BS QTL is associated with a gene different from either Yrns-B1 or YrRub, two stripe rust resistance genes mapped to this region in other studies. The 5AL QTL carries a previously unreported partial stripe rust resistance gene, designated here as Yr48. This paper discusses the individual contributions to resistance of these four QTL, their epistatic interactions, and their potential in durable resistance breeding strategies based on combinations of partial resistance genes.

AB Stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.) (the causal agent of wheat stem rust) race Ug99 (also designated TTKSK) and its derivatives have defeated several important stem rust resistance genes widely used in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, rendering much of the worldwide wheat acreage susceptible. In order to identify new resistance sources, a large collection of wheat relatives and genetic stocks maintained at the Wheat Genetic and Genomic Resources Center was screened. The results revealed that most accessions of the diploid relative Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy were highly resistant. The screening of a set of wheat-D. villosum chromosome addition lines revealed that the wheat-D. villosum disomic addition line DA6V#3 was moderately resistant to race Ug99. The objective of the present study was to produce and characterize compensating wheat-D. villosum whole arm Robertsonian translocations (RobTs) involving chromosomes 6D of wheat and 6V#3 of D. villosum through the mechanism of centric breakage-fusion. Seven 6V#3-specific EST-STS markers were developed for screening F(2) progeny derived from plants double-monosomic for chromosomes 6D and 6V#3. Surprisingly, although 6D was the target chromosome, all recovered RobTs involved chromosome 6A implying a novel mechanism for the origin of RobTs. Homozygous translocations (T6AS.6V#3L and T6AL.6V#3S) with good plant vigor and full fertility were selected from F(3) families. A stem rust resistance gene was mapped to the long arm 6V#3L in T6AS.6V#3L and was designated as Sr52. Sr52 is temperature-sensitive and is most effective at 16 degrees C, partially effective at 24 degrees C, and ineffective at 28 degrees C. The T6AS.6V#3L stock is a new source of resistance to Ug99, is cytogenetically stable, and may be useful in wheat improvement.

AB Antibodies against the wheat storage globulin Glo-3A from a patient with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease were enriched to identify potential molecular mimicry between wheat antigens and T1D target tissues. Recombinant Glo-3A was used to enrich anti-Glo-3A immunoglobulin G antibodies from plasma by batch affinity chromatography. Rat jejunum and pancreas, as well as human duodenum and monocytes were probed, and binding was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Glo-3A-enriched antibodies bound to a specific subset of cells in the lamina propria of rat jejunum that co-localized mostly with a marker of resident, alternatively activated CD163-positive (CD163(+)) macrophages. Blood monocytes and macrophage-like cells in human duodenum were also labelled with the enriched antibodies. Blocking studies revealed that binding to CD163+ macrophages was not due to cross-reactivity with anti-Glo-3A antibodies, but rather to non-Glo-3A antibodies co-purified during antibody enrichment. The novel finding of putative autoantibodies against tolerogenic intestinal CD163(+) macrophages suggests that regulatory macrophages were targeted in this patient with celiac disease and T1D.

AB Background and Aims To address the issues associated with food security, environmental change and bioenergy in the context of crop plants, the production, identification and evaluation of novel plant phenotypes is fundamental. One of the major routes to this end will be wide hybridization and introgression breeding. The transfer of chromosomes and chromosome segments between related species (chromosome engineering or alien introgression) also provides an important resource for determining the genetic control of target traits. However, the realization of the full potential of chromosome engineering has previously been hampered by the inability to identify and characterize interspecific introgressions accurately.
   Methods Seven monosomic substitution lines have been generated comprising Festuca pratensis as the donor species and Lolium perenne as the recipient. Each of the seven lines has a different L. perenne chromosome replaced by the homoeologous F. pratensis chromosome (13 L. perenne + 1 F. pratensis chromosome). Molecular markers and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) were used to assign the F. pratensis chromosomes introgressed in each of the monosomic substitutions to a specific linkage group. Cytological observations were also carried out on metaphase I of meiosis in each of the substitution lines.
   Results A significant level of synteny was found at the macro-level between L. perenne and F. pratensis. The observations at metaphase I revealed the presence of a low level of interspecific chromosomal translocations between these species.
   Discussion The isolation of the seven monosomic substitution lines provides a resource for dissecting the genetic control of important traits and for gene isolation. Parallels between the L. perenne/F. pratensis system and the Pooideae cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats and the model grass Brachypodium distachyon present opportunities for a comparison across the species in terms of genotype and phenotype.

AB The group 1 pathogenesis-related (PR-1) proteins, known as hallmarks of defense pathways, are encoded by multigene families in plants as evidenced by the presence of 22 and 32 PR-1 genes in the finished Arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively. Here, we report the initial characterization and mapping of 23 PR-1-like (TaPr-1) genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which possesses one of the largest (> 16,000 megabases) genomes among monocot crop plants. Sequence analysis revealed that the 23 TaPr-1 genes all contain intron-free open reading frames that encode a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a conserved PR-1-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaPr-1 genes form three major monophyletic groups along with their counterparts in other monocots; each group consists of genes encoding basic, basic with a C-terminal extension, and acidic PR-1 proteins, respectively, suggesting diversity and conservation of PR-1 gene functions in monocot plants. Mapping analysis assisted by untranslated region-specified discrimination (USD) markers and various cytogenetic stocks located the 23 TaPr-1 genes to seven different chromosomes, with the majority mapping to chromosomes of homoeologous groups 5 and 7. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that 12 TaPr-1 genes were induced or up-regulated upon pathogen challenge. Together, this study provides insights to the origin, evolution, homoeologous relationships, and expression patterns of the TaPr-1 genes. The data presented provide critical information for further genome-wide characterization of the wheat PR-1 gene family and the USD markers developed will facilitate genetic and functional analysis of PR-1 genes associated with plant defense and/or other important traits.

AB TaSnRK2.7, a SnRK2 (sucrose non-fermenting1-related protein kinase 2) member of wheat, confers enhanced multi-stress tolerance in carbohydrate metabolism. Here, the nucleotide diversity of TaSnRK2.7 was investigated in 60 wheat accessions with different stress-tolerant features. One copy, named TaSnRK2.7-B, was detected in 32 accessions, which mainly exhibited stress tolerance. The TaSnRK2.7-B evolutionary dynamics were examined in these cultivars, which have been subjected to population bottlenecks and intensive selection in breeding.
   Nucleotide diversity (pi) in the entire TaSnRK2.7-B region was 0.00148. Sliding-window analysis demonstrated that 3932-4535 bp was a variation-enriched region, coveting the eighth intron, the ninth exon and the 3'-flanking region. As predicted, neutrality tests revealed that the TaSnRK2.7-B protein was relatively conservative, and population bottlenecks or purifying selection may have acted on TaSnRK2.7-B. Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium between SNP loci extends across the entire TaSnRK2.7-B region. A SNP marker of TaSnRK2.7-B was developed and mapped on chromosome 2AL flanked by WMC179.4 and WMC401, which were co-located in the same or adjacent chromosome intervals with QTLs for phosphorus utilization efficiency and accumulation efficiency of stem water-soluble carbohydrates.

AB Gibberella zeae, the principal cause of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of barley, contaminates grains with several mycotoxins, which creates a serious problem for the malting barley industry in the United States, China, and Europe. However, limited studies have been conducted on the trichothecene profiles and population genetic structure of G. zeae isolates collected from barley in the United States. Trichothecene biosynthesis gene (TRI)-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and 10 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers were used to determine the genetic diversity and compare the trichothecene profiles of an older population (n = 115 isolates) of G. zeae collected in 1997 to 2000 with a newer population (n = 147 isolates) collected in 2008. Samples were from across the major barley-growing regions in North Dakota and Minnesota. The results of TRI-based PCR assays were further validated using a subset of 32 and 28 isolates of G. zeae by sequence analysis and gas chromatography, respectively. TRI-based PCR assays revealed that all the G. zeae isolates in both populations had markers for deoxynivalenol (DON), and the frequencies of isolates with a 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) marker in the newer population were approximate to 11-fold higher than those among isolates in the older population. G. zeae populations from barley in the Midwest of the United States showed no spatial structure, and all the isolates were solidly in clade 7 of G. zeae, which is quite different from other barley-growing areas of world, where multiple species of G. woe are commonly found in close proximity and display spatial structure. VNTR analysis showed high gene diversity (H = 0.82 to 0.83) and genotypic diversity but low linkage disequilibrium (LD = 0.02 to 0.07) in both populations. Low genetic differentiation (F(ST) = 0.013) and high gene flow (Nm = 36.84) was observed between the two populations and among subpopulations within the same population (Nm = 12.77 to 29.97), suggesting that temporal and spatial variations had little influence on population differentiation in the Upper Midwest. Similarly, tow F(ST) (0.02) was observed between 3-ADON and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol populations, indicating minor influence of the chemotype of G. zeae isolates on population subdivision, although there was a rapid increase in the frequencies of isolates with the 3-ADON marker in the Upper Midwest between the older collection made in 1997 to 2000 and the newer collection made in 2008. This study provides information to barley-breeding programs for their selection of isolates of G. zeae for evaluating barley genotypes for resistance to FHB and DON accumulation.

AB Genes for adaptation to climatic conditions can have an impact on the expression of genes for agricultural productivity. This study tested the hypothesis that winter wheat cultivars registered in middle Europe (especially the Czech and Slovak Republics) during the period 1976-2009 were differentially adapted to different regions, reflecting selection for different allelic combinations. This was tested by analysing for the presence of alleles at the Rht and Ppd loci using molecular markers and gibberellic acids (GA) response tests. Four allelic variants (174, 192, 165 and 198-bp) were detected at the Xgwm261 locus linked to Rht8 on chromosome 2D. The 198-bp allele was rare, but present in some of the most widely grown cultivars. Of 85 cultivars grown in the area of Czech Republic, the 174-bp allele predominated in frequency and area (39 cultivars), often in combination with Ppd-D1b (30 out of 39 cultivars) and Rht-D1b (15 out of 30 cultivars). In neighbouring Slovakia, the 192-bp allele, generally associated with Ppd-D1a, was detected in 30 out of 40 cultivars; in 12 cultivars accompanied by a GA-insensitive allele on 4B chromosome (pedigree analyses indicated a high prevalence of the Rht-B1d allele). The 192-bp (Rht8)/Ppd-D1a linkage block was broken up in 7 out of 22 cultivars that carried the 192-bp allele in the 'Czech collection'. Analysis of the effects of year of registration on allele frequency showed a decline in GA-insensitive cultivars released recently in both countries, and great changes in the frequency of the 2D alleles during the period 1981-2009 in the Czech Republic. The pedigrees of successful cultivars were examined to find probable sources of Xgwm261 192-bp, 174-bp and 165-bp alleles on 2D and Rht genes located on chromosomes 4B and 4D. These results will impact on breeding strategies and the exploitation of existing registered wheat cultivars in different regions and growing systems.

AB Oil content of soybean was a valuable quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. Eleven QTLs were detected by both CIM and MIM method with the population crossed between Charleston and Dong nong594 in recent 3 years (2007, 2008, 2009). Combining the QTLs collected over the past 20 years, an integrated map of oil-content major QTLs in soybean was established using soymap2, which was published in 2004, as a reference. Using the software BioMercator ver.2.1, QTLs were projected from their own maps onto the reference map. In total, ninety-eight QTLs were integrated into soymap2. A meta-analysis method was used to narrow down the confidence interval, and 20 consensus QTLs and their corresponding markers were obtained. Using a local version of GENSCAN, 10,137 sequences in the consensus QTL intervals were predicted. With BLAST, these predicted genes were compared to the International Protein Index database to mine the related genes. The results offer a basis for gene mining and molecular breeding in soybean.

AB By carefully separating type I and type II resistances, the possible effects of plant height on fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat were assessed using near-isogenic lines (NILs) for several different reduced-height (Rht) genes. Tall isolines all gave better type I resistance than their respective dwarf counterparts when assessed at their natural heights. These differences largely disappeared when the dwarf isolines were physically raised so that their spikes were positioned at the same height as those of their respective tall counterparts. The effects of plant height on type II resistance was less clear. For those NIL pairs which showed significant differences, it was the dwarf isolines which gave better resistance. As the Rht genes involved in these NILs locate at different genomic regions, the differences in FHB between the dwarf and tall isolines are unlikely to be the result of linkages between each of the different Rht loci with a beneficial or a deleterious gene affecting type I or type II resistance. Rather, the different FHB resistances are probably caused by direct or indirect effects of height difference per se, and microclimate may have contributed to the better type I resistance of the tall plants. Thus, caution should be exercised when attempting to exploit any of the FHB resistant loci co-located with Rht genes.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. is a common and widespread disease of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), in Argentina. Host resistance is the most economical, effective and ecologically sustainable method of controlling the disease. Gene postulation helps to determine leaf rust resistance genes (Lr genes) that may be present in a large group of wheat germplasm. Additionally presence of Lr genes can be determined using associated molecular markers. The objective of this study was to identify Lr genes that condition leaf rust resistance in 66 wheat cultivars from Argentina. Twenty four differential lines with individual known leaf rust resistance genes were tested with 17 different pathotypes of leaf rust collected from Argentina. Leaf rust infection types produced on seedling plants of the 66 local cultivars were compared with the infection types produced by the same pathotypes on Lr differentials to postulate which seedling leaf rust genes were present. Presence of Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr20, Lr21, Lr24, Lr25, Lr26, Lr29, Lr34, Lr35, Lr37, Lr47 and Lr51 was also determined using molecular markers. Eleven different Lr genes were postulated in the material: Lr1, Lr3a, Lr3ka, Lr9, Lr10, Lr16, Lr17, Lr19, Lr24, Lr26, Lr41. Presence of Lr21, Lr25, Lr29, and Lr47 could not be determined with the seventeen pathotypes used in the study because all were avirulent to these genes. Eleven cultivars (16.7%) were resistant to all pathotypes used in the study and the remaining 55 (83.3%) showed virulent reaction against one or more local pathotypes. Cultivars with seedling resistance gene combinations including Lr16 or single genes Lr47 (detected with molecular marker), Lr19 and Lr41, showed high levels of resistance against all pathotypes or most of them. On the opposite side, cultivars with seedling resistance genes Lr1, Lr3a, Lr3a + Lr24, Lr10, Lr3a + Lr10, Lr3a + Lr10 + Lr24 showed the highest number of virulent reactions against local pathotypes. Occurrence of adult plant resistance genes Lr34, Lr35 and Lr37 in local germplasm was evaluated using specific molecular markers confirming presence of Lr34 and Lr37. Our data suggest that combinations including seedling resistance genes like Lr16, Lr47, Lr19, Lr41, Lr21, Lr25 and Lr29, with adult plant resistance genes like Lr34, SV2, Lr46 will probably provide durable and effective resistance to leaf rust in the region.

AB Protein content in rice grain (Oryza sativa L.) is an important trait from human nutrition perspective, particularly for those having rice as a main food in daily life. Several QTLs identified for the grain protein content (GPC) needs refinement and further genetic dissection to truly understand the trait. In this study we have searched for the putative candidate genes underlying five known QTLs, (AQT033, AQT034, AQT037, AQT039 and AQT040) governing high grain protein content in rice. Important putative candidate genes encoding glutelin precursor, peptide transporter, aminotransferases etc were found underlying selected QTLs. The in silico expression analysis of candidate genes by massively parallel signature sequence (MPSS) revealed very strong expression for gutelin precursor gene and higher expressions for phosphoesterase, peptide transporter, aminotransferases and calmudulin dependent protein kinase genes. The tissue library information revealed their higher expression in pollen, stigma, immature panicles, germinating and developing seed tissues at reproductive stage. Further characterization of the candidate genes by digital microarrays in the reproductive development stage resulted in identification of genes showing higher seed specific expression. Further, we assessed the abundance of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the candidate genes as well as genomic, ESTs and cDNA sequences underlying QTLs. A total of 483 SSRs including 113 SSRs in the genomic, 133 in the cDNA and 237 SSRs in the EST sequences were identified. According to sequence length, the potentially variable Class II SSRs were the most commonly found microsatellites, followed by hyper variable Class I markers. Seventeen QTL specific microsatellite markers have been developed from the genomic, cDNA and EST regions. The identification of novel microsatellite markers and putative candidate genes based on MPSS signatures and digital micro arrays in this study will help in the development of gene specific markers for marker-assisted mapping as well as discovery of novel GPC related genes in rice.

AB Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are important resources for gene discovery and mapping. The objectives of the work presented here are to develop EST based SSR markers, their polymorphism in Catharanthus roseus and to study Cross-species transferability in other medicinal plants. C. roseus is a plant of great medicinal value and contains more than 130 alkaloids namely vincristine, vinblastine, ajamalcine, serpentine, etc. In this study, we analyzed 19899 ESTs and identified 2034 SSRs from 1763 SSR-containing unique ESTs. Of the 2034 EST-SSRs, 42.8% were dinucleotide repeats, 41.9% tri, 6.8% tetra, 4.7% penta and 3.6% were hexanucleotide repeats. From these SSR-containing ESTs, a total of 170 primer pairs were designed among them 20 were selected randomly for the validation of amplification and polymorphism in C. roseus. Out of these 20 primer pairs, 16 (80%) primer pairs could amplify and among them 11 (55%) exhibited polymorphic profiles in C. roseus genotypes. Furthermore, transferable analysis of these primer pairs revealed high Cross-species transferability (31-57%) in three medicinally important plants Croton macrostachyus, Salvia schimperi and Ageratum conizoides. The high reproducibility, scorable bands per marker (3.2), transferability and polymorphism demonstrate the potential utility of these EST-SSR markers in molecular mapping, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and comparative mapping in C. roseus and other medicinal plants.

AB An experiment was conducted to study the mode of Inheritance of resistance to leaf rust and stem rust In an interspecific derivative Selection 2427 (Sel.2427). The genetic analysis in F(2) and BC(1) generations revealed that resistance against selective pathotypes of leaf rust, 77-5 and 77-7, and stem rust, 40A, and 117-6 is controlled by a single dominant gene. The resistance In Sel. 2427 appeared to be diverse and may be useful in wheat improvement. Cytological analysis at first meiotic metaphase in monosomic and disomic F, plants derived from the crosses between twenty one monosomic lines of Chinese Spring and Se1.2427 showed that the number of bivalents differed significantly. Precocious separation of bivalents occurred uniformly in the PMCs Irrespective of euploidy or aneuploidy. Probably the segment translocated from Aegilops speltoides to wheat chromosome in Sel. 2427 affected the homologous chromosome pairing leading to precocious separation and inducing desynapsis. The segment also affected pollen fertility making F(1) hybrid partially male sterile resulting in low seed set in F(1) and F(2). Sel. 2427 may be useful material for studying chromosome pairing and chiasma formation.

AB Biotic or abiotic stress can cause considerable damage to crop plants that can be managed by building disease resistance in the cultivated gene pool through breeding for disease resistance genes (R-genes). R-genes, conferring resistance to diverse pathogens or pests share a high level of similarity at the DNA and protein levels in different plant species. This property of R-genes has been successfully employed to isolate putative resistance gene analogues (RGAs) using a PCR-based approach from new plant sources. Using a similar approach, in the present study, we have successfully amplified putative RGAs having nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR-type RGAs) from seven different sources: two cultivated coffee species (Coffea arabica L. and Coffea canephora Pierre ex. A. Froehner), four related taxa endemic to India (wild tree coffee species: Psilanthus bengalensis (Roem. & Schuttles) J.-F. Leroy, Psilanthus khasiana, Psilanthus travencorensis (Wight & Arn.) J.-F. Leroy, Psilanthus weightiana (Wall. ex Wight & Arn.) J.-F. Leroy), and a cDNA pool originally prepared from light-and drought-stressed Coffea arabica L. leaves. The total PCR amplicons obtained using NBS-LRR-specific primers from each source were cloned and transformed to construct seven independent libraries, from which 434 randomly picked clones were sequenced. In silico analysis of the sequenced clones revealed 27 sequences that contained characteristic RGA motifs, of which 24 had complete uninterrupted open reading frames. Comparisons of these with published RGAs showed several of these to be novel RGA sequences. Interestingly, most of such novel RGAs belonged to the related wild Psilanthus species. The data thus suggest the potential of the secondary gene pool as possible untapped donors of resistance genes to the present day cultivated species of coffee.

AB A set of 90 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from F(1) plants that originated from a cross between xTriticosecale Wittm. 'Saka3006' and xTriticosecale Wittm. 'Modus', via wide crossing with maize, were used to create a genetic linkage map of triticale. The map has 21 linkage groups assigned to the A, B, and R genomes including 155 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 1385 diversity array technology (DArT), and 28 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers covering 2397 cM with a mean distance between two markers of 4.1 cM. Comparative analysis with wheat consensus maps revealed that triticale chromosomes of the A and B genomes were represented by 15 chromosomes, including combinations of 2AS. 2AL#, 2AL#2BL, 6AS.6AL#, and 2BS.6AL# instead of 2A, 2B, and 6A. In respect to published maps of rye, substantial rearrangements were found also for chromosomes 1R, 2R, and 3R of the rye genome. Chromosomes 1R and 2R were truncated and the latter was linked with 3R. A nonhomogeneous distribution of markers across the triticale genome was observed with evident bias (48%) towards the rye genome. This genetic map may serve as a reference linkage map of triticale for efficient studies of structural rearrangements, gene mapping, and marker-assisted selection.

AB The genetic diversity within wheat breeding programs across Turkey and Kazakhstan was compared with a selection of European cultivars that represented the genetic diversity across eight European countries and six decades of wheat breeding. To focus the measure of genetic diversity on that relevant to disease-resistant phenotypes, nucleotide-binding-site (NBS) profiling was used to detect polymorphisms associated with the NBS motifs found within the NBS - leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of resistance (R) genes. Cereal-specific NBS primers, designed specifically to the conserved NBS motifs found within cereal R-genes, provided distinct NBS profiles. Although the genetic diversity associated with NBS motifs was only slightly higher within the Eastern wheat genotypes, the NBS profiles produced by Eastern and European wheat lines differed considerably. Structure analysis divided the wheat genotypes into four groups, which compared well with the origin of the wheat genotypes. The highest levels of genetic diversity were seen for the wheat genotypes from the Genetic Resource Collection held in Ankara, Turkey, as wheat genotypes within breeding programs were genetically more similar. The wheat genotypes from Kazakhstan were the most similar to the European cultivars, reflecting the significant number of eastern European cultivars used in the breeding program in Kazakhstan. In general, the NBS profiles suggested that NBS-LRR R-gene usage in winter wheat breeding in Turkey and Kazakhstan differed from that deployed in European cultivars.

AB Bi-directional selective genotyping (BSG) carried out on two opposite groups of F(9)(541 x Ot1-3) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with extremely low and extremely high alpha-amylase activities in mature (dry) grain of rye, followed by molecular mapping, revealed a complex system of selection-responsive loci. Three classes of loci controlling alpha-amylase activity were discerned, including four major AAD loci on chromosomes 3R (three loci) and 6RL (one locus) responding to both directions of the disruptive selection, 20 AAR loci on chromosomes 2RL (three loci), 3R (three loci), 4RS (two loci), 5RL (three loci), 6R (two loci) and 7R (seven loci) responding to selection for low alpha-amylase activity and 17 AAE loci on chromosomes 1RL (seven loci), 2RS (two loci), 3R (two loci), 5R (two loci) and 6RL (four loci) affected by selection for high alpha-amylase activity. The majority of the discerned AA loci also showed responsiveness to selection for preharvest sprouting (PHS). Two AAD loci on chromosome arm 3RL coincided with PHSD loci. The AAD locus on chromosome arm 3RS was independent from PHS, whereas that on chromosome 6RL belonged to the PHSR class. AAR-PHSR loci were found on chromosomes 4RS (one locus) and 5R (two loci) and AAE-PHSE loci were identified on chromosomes 1RL (one locus) and 5RL (one locus). Some PHSD loci represented the AAE (chromosomes 1RL, 3RS and 3RL) or AAR classes (chromosome 5RL). AAR and AAE loci not related to PHS were found on chromosomes 1RL, 2R, 3RS, 4R, 6RL and 7RL. On the other hand, several PHS loci (1RL, 3RS, 5RL, 6RS and 7RS) had no effect on alpha-amylase activity. Allele originating from the parental line 541 mapped in six AA loci on chromosomes 2R (two loci), 5R (three loci) and 7R (one locus) exerted opposite effects on PHS and alpha-amylase activity. Differences between the AA and PHS systems of loci may explain the weak correlation between these two traits observed among recombinant inbred lines. Strategies for the breeding of sprouting-resistant varieties with low alpha-amylase and high PHS resistance are discussed.

ID BREAD WHEAT
AB Leaf rust resistance gene Lr28 controls one of the important resistances in the Indian subcontinent against the most prevalent Puccinia triticina pathotype 77-5. Pyramiding Lr28 with other resistance genes would therefore, provide durable resistance against rust, a process that can be facilitated by DNA markers. A microsatellite marker wmc313 linked to Lr28 at a distance of 5.0 cM was identified in the population HD2329 x HW2037. The marker was validated in another population developed from WL711x CS + Lr28: 2D/2M 3/8 (acc. 2956) as well as in a few near- isogenic lines (NILs) carrying gene Lr28. Compared to the previously reported marker TPSCAR SCS421(570), wmc313 is more closely linked to Lr28. Both these markers flanking the gene should be useful in the deployment of Lr28 into the breeding program using marker-assisted selection allowing pyramiding with other effective genes to confer durable resistance.

AB Trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) is a sugar signal that regulates metabolism, growth, and development and inhibits the central regulatory SNF1-related protein kinase1 (SnRK1; AKIN10/AKIN11). To better understand the mechanism in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain, we analyze T6P content and SnRK1 activities. T6P levels changed 178-fold 1 to 45 d after anthesis (DAA), correlating with sucrose content. T6P ranged from 78 nmol g(-1) fresh weight (FW) pregrain filling, around 100-fold higher than previously reported in plants, to 0.4 nmol g(-1) FW during the desiccation stage. In contrast, maximum SnRK1 activity changed only 3-fold but was inhibited strongly by T6P in vitro. To assess SnRK1 activity in vivo, homologs of SnRK1 marker genes in the wheat transcriptome were identified using Wheat Estimated Transcript Server. SnRK1-induced and -repressed marker genes were expressed differently pregrain filling compared to grain filling consistent with changes in T6P. To investigate this further maternal and filial tissues were compared pre-(7 DAA) and during grain filling (17 DAA). Strikingly, in vitro SnRK1 activity was similar in all tissues in contrast to large changes in tissue distribution of T6P. At 7 DAAT6P was 49 to 119 nmol g(-1) FW in filial and maternal tissues sufficient to inhibit SnRK1; at 17 DAAT6P accumulation was almost exclusively endospermal (43 nmol g(-1) FW) with 0.6 to 0.8 nmol T6P g(-1) FW in embryo and pericarp. The data show a correlation between T6P and sucrose overall that belies a marked effect of tissue type and developmental stage on T6P content, consistent with tissue-specific regulation of SnRK1 by T6P in wheat grain.

AB Fifty wheat varieties along with Jupateco-73 and Morocco were studied for the expression of leaf tip necrosis (LTN), a trait linked with the durable rust resistance gene pair Lr34/Yr18. LTN was frequent (i.e., a parts per thousand yen6) in nine replications of a field experiment over 3 years in 17 genotypes, and the varieties were considered positive for LTN. In molecular analyses of these varieties, having relative severity values up to 78 for yellow rust and 45 for leaf rust, the 150-bp Lr34/Yr18-linked allele was consistently amplified. Expression of LTN in six of nine replications is an appropriate threshold for predicting the presence of Lr34/Yr18 gene pair, and genotypes can be selected using this trait.

One of the gibberellin 20-oxidase genes (Hv20ox (2) ) was identified as the candidate gene for sdw1/denso. Semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that Hv20ox (2) was expressed at different levels in various organs of barley. Transcriptional levels were reduced in leaf blade, sheath, stem and rachis tissue in the barley variety Baudin with the denso gene. Subsequently, the relative expression levels of Hv20ox (2) were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in a doubled haploid population and mapped as a quantitative trait. A single expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) was identified and mapped to its structural gene region on chromosome 3H. The eQTL was co-located with QTLs for yield, height, development score, hectolitre weight and grain plumpness. The expression level of Hv20ox (2) was reduced fourfold in the denso mutant, but around 60-fold in the sdw1 mutant, compared to the control variety. The reduced expression level of Hv20ox (2) enhanced grain yield by increasing the number of effective tillers, but had negative effects on grain and malting quality. The sdw1 gene can be used only in feed barley due to its severe reduction of Hv20ox (2) expression. The gene expression marker for Hv20ox (2) can be used to distinguish different alleles of sdw1/denso.

AB Two Iranian common wheat landraces AUS28183 and AUS28187 from the Watkins collection showed high levels of seedling resistance against Australian pathotypes of leaf rust and stripe rust pathogens. Chi-squared analyses of rust response segregation among F(3) populations derived from crosses of AUS28183 and AUS28187 with a susceptible genotype AUS27229 revealed monogenic inheritance of leaf rust and stripe rust resistance. As both genotypes produced similar leaf rust and stripe rust infection types, they were assumed to carry the same genes. The genes were temporarily named as LrW1 and YrW1. Molecular mapping placed LrW1 and YrW1 in the short arm of chromosome 5B, about 10 and 15 cM proximal to the SSR marker gwm234, respectively, and the marker cfb309 mapped 8-12 cM proximal to YrW1. LrW1 mapped 3-6 cM distal to YrW1 in two F(3) populations. AUS28183 corresponded to the accession V336 of the Watkins collection which was the original source of Lr52. Based on the genomic location and accession records, LrW1 was concluded to be Lr52. Because no other seedling stripe rust resistance gene has previously been mapped in chromosome 5BS, YrW1 was permanently named as Yr47. A combination of flanking markers gwm234 and cfb309 with phenotypic assays could be used to ascertain the presence of Lr52 and Yr47 in segregating populations. This investigation characterised a valuable source of dual leaf rust and stripe rust resistance for deployment in new wheat cultivars. Transfer of Lr52 and Yr47 into current Australian wheat backgrounds is in progress.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat causes not only significant reduction in grain yield and end-use quality, but also the contamination of the grain with mycotoxins that are detrimental to human and animal health after consumption of infected grain. Growing resistant varieties is an effective approach to minimize the FHB damage. The Chinese wheat landrace Haiyanzhong (HYZ) shows a high level of resistance to FHB. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to FHB resistance in HYZ, 136 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were developed from a cross of HYZ and Wheaton, a hard spring wheat cultivar from the USA. The RIL and their parents were evaluated for percentage of scabbed spikelets (PSS) in both greenhouse and field environments. Five QTL were detected for FHB resistance in HYZ with one major QTL on 7DL. The 7DL QTL peaked at SSR marker Xwmc121, which is flanked by the SSR markers Xcfd46 and Xwmc702. This QTL explained 20.4-22.6% of the phenotypic variance in individual greenhouse experiments and 15.9% in a field experiment. Four other minor QTL on 6BS (two QTL), 5AS and 1AS each explained less than 10% of the phenotypic variance in individual experiments. HYZ carried the favorable alleles associated with FHB resistance at the QTL on 7DL, 6BS and 5AS, and the unfavorable allele at the QTL on 1AS. The major QTL on 7D can be used to improve the FHB resistance in wheat breeding programs and add diversity to the FHB resistance gene pool.

AB Plant height (PH) in wheat is a complex trait; its components include spike length (SL) and internode lengths. To precisely analyze the factors affecting PH, two F(8:9) recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations comprising 485 and 229 lines were generated. Crosses were performed between Weimai 8 and Jimai 20 (WJ) and between Weimai 8 and Yannong 19 (WY). Possible genetic relationships between PH and PH components (PHC) were evaluated at the quantitative trait locus (QTL) level. PH and PHC (including SL and internode lengths from the first to the fourth counted from the top, abbreviated as FIITL, SITL, TITL, and FOITL, respectively) were measured in four environments. Individual and the pooled values from four trials were used in the present analysis. A QTL for PH was mapped using data on PH and on PH conditioned by PHC using IciMapping V2.2. All 21 chromosomes in wheat were shown to harbor factors affecting PH in two populations, by both conditional and unconditional QTL mapping methods. At least 11 pairwise congruent QTL were identified in the two populations. In total, ten unconditional QTL and five conditional QTL that could be detected in the conditional analysis only have been verified in no less than three trials in WJ and WY. In addition, three QTL on the short arms of chromosomes 4B, 4D, and 7B were mapped to positions similar to those of the semi-dwarfing genes Rht-B1, Rht-D1 and Rht13, respectively. Conditional QTL mapping analysis in WJ and WY proved that, at the QTL level, SL contributed the least to PH, followed by FIITL; TITL had the strongest influence on PH, followed by SITL and FOITL. The results above indicated that the conditional QTL mapping method can be used to evaluate possible genetic relationships between PH and PHC, and it can efficiently and precisely reveal counteracting QTL, which will enhance the understanding of the genetic basis of PH in wheat. The combination of two related populations with a large/moderate population size made the results authentic and accurate.

AB The emergence of a new highly virulent race of stem rust (Puccinia graminis tritici), Ug99, rapid evolution of new Ug99 derivative races overcoming resistance of widely deployed genes, and spread towards important wheat growing areas now potentially threaten world food security. Exploiting novel genes effective against Ug99 from wild relatives of wheat is one of the most promising strategies for the protection of the wheat crop. A new source of resistance to Ug99 was identified in the short arm of the Aegilops searsii chromosome 3S(s) by screening wheat- Ae. searsii introgression libraries available as individual chromosome and chromosome arm additions to the wheat genome. For transferring this resistance gene into common wheat, we produced three double-monosomic chromosome populations (3A/3S(s), 3B/3S(s) and 3D/3S(s)) and then applied integrated stem rust screening, molecular maker analysis, and cytogenetic analysis to identify resistant wheat-Ae. searsii Robertsonian translocation. Three Robertsonian translocations (T3AL center dot 3S(s)S, T3BL center dot 3S(s)S and T3DL center dot 3S(s)S) and one recombinant (T3DS-3S(s)S center dot 3S(s)L) with stem rust resistance were identified and confirmed to be genetically compensating on the basis of genomic in situ hybridization, analysis of 3A, 3B, 3D and 3S(s)S-specific SSR/STS-PCR markers, and C-banding. In addition, nine SSR/STS-PCR markers of 3S(s)S-specific were developed for marker-assisted selection of the resistant gene. Efforts to reduce potential linkage drag associated with 3S(s)S of Ae. searsii are currently under way.

AB The grain color of wheat affects not only the brightness of flour, but also tolerance to preharvest sprouting. Grain color is controlled by dominant R-1 genes located on the long arm of hexaploid wheat chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D (R-A1, R-B1, and R-D1, respectively). The red pigment of the grain coat is composed of catechin and proanthocyanidin (PA), which are synthesized via the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. We isolated the Tamyb10-A1, Tamyb10-B1, and Tamyb10-D1 genes, located on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D, respectively. These genes encode R2R3-type MYB domain proteins, similar to TT2 of Arabidopsis, which controls PA synthesis in testa. In recessive R-A1 lines, two types of Tamyb10-A1 genes: (1) deletion of the first half of the R2-repeat of the MYB region and (2) insertion of a 2.2-kb transposon belonging to the hAT family. The Tamyb10-B1 genes of recessive R-B1 lines had 19-bp deletion, which caused a frame shift in the middle part of the open reading frame. With a transient assay using wheat coleoptiles, we revealed that the Tamyb10 gene in the dominant R-1 allele activated the flavonoid biosynthetic genes. We developed PCR-based markers to detect the dominant/recessive alleles of R-A1, R-B1, and R-D1. These markers proved to be correlated to known R-1 genotypes of 33 varieties except for a mutant with a single nucleotide substitution. Furthermore, double-haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross between red- and white-grained lines were found to necessarily carry functional Tamyb10 gene(s). Thus, PCR-based markers for Tamyb10 genes are very useful to detect R-1 alleles.

AB Arabinoxylans (AX) are prebiotics found naturally in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour with well known beneficial effects on human health. Arabinoxylan concentration was measured in wheat grain of the Berkut x Krichauff doubled haploid (DH) population grown at two contrasting environments in South Australia; one at an adequate-rainfall site in Roseworthy in 2009 and one at a low-rainfall site in Minnipa in 2007. A linkage map of 528 genetic markers was used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. There was wide variation in the grain AX concentrations within the DH population in both environments, ranging from 5.4 to 8.5% (of dry weight), and there was a significant phenotypic correlation between two environments. Heritability was estimated as 0.51. Quantitative trait loci associated with grain AX concentrations were located on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 3D, 4D, 6B, and 7A. Quantitative trait loci on 2A (QGax.aww-2A.1) and 4D (QGax.aww-4D.1) had major effects. At QGax.aww-2A.1, the favorable allele came from Berkut, while at QGax.aww-4D.1, the favorable allele was derived from Krichauff. Effects of markers at these two QTLs were further validated using grain from more environments (Roseworthy, Minnipa, and Booleroo, South Australia, in 2006). In all cases, lines carrying both favorable alleles at those loci contributed a significant increase in wheat grain AX concentration compared to lines without the favorable alleles. These genome regions could therefore be useful targets for wheat breeding or mapping of candidate genes controlling grain AX accumulation.

AB Grain hardness is one of the most important quality characteristics of cultivated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L). A large deletion in the puroindoline a (Pina) gene or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the puroindoline b (Pinb) gene results in hard grain texture. So far, nine Pina alleles (Pina-D1a-Pina-D1b, Pina-D1k-Pina-D1q) and seventeen Pinb alleles (Pinb-D1a-Pinb-D1g, Pinb-D1p-Pinb-D1ab) have been identified in bread wheat. The major Pina and Pinb alleles identified in hard wheat cultivars are Pina-D1b. Pinb-D1b, Pinb-D1c and Pinb-D1d. In this study, a three-primer PCR system was employed to develop nine co-dominant STS markers for genotyping Pina-D1a and Pina-D1b, whereas temperature-switch (TS) PCR was used to develop six co-dominant SNP markers for genotyping the Pinb-D1a, Pinb-D1b, Pinb-D1c and Pinb-D1d alleles. These STS and TS-PCR markers were used to verify the grain hardness genotype of 100 wheat cultivars. The reliability and genotyping accuracy of TS-PCR markers were confirmed through sequencing of PCR products and a comparison with previously published results. Therefore, STS and TS-PCR markers offer a simple, cost-effective and reliable method for high-throughput genotyping Pina and Pinb alleles to select grain hardness in wheat quality breeding programs and for wheat market classification.

AB We investigated the expression patterns of a granule bound starch synthase I (GBSSI = Waxy) gene at different developmental stages of storage and non-storage organs in Amaranthus cruentus. GBSSI transcripts were strongly expressed in the middle and mid-late stages of seed development and thereafter expression decreased. In addition, this gene was expressed in all non-storage organs tested (the leaf, stem, petiole and root) and showed a tendency to increase during plant development. Therefore, our results indicate that the amaranth GBSSI gene exhibits late expression in the perisperm, and that it is expressed in both storage and non-storage tissues. We also investigated the genetic diversity of GBSSI among 37 strains of amaranth grains originating from New World. A comparison of the GBSSI coding sequence revealed an extremely high level of sequence conservation, and a single nucleotide polymorphism between the sequences of non-waxy (Type I) and waxy (Type II) phenotypes was detected. This indicates that a G-T polymorphism in exon 10 (a nonsense mutation) was a unique event in the evolution of the GBSSI gene in amaranth grains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genes which confer partial resistance to the rusts in wheat figure prominently in discussions of potential durable resistance strategies. The positional cloning of the first of these genes, Lr34/Yr18 and Yr36, has revealed different protein structures, suggesting that the category of partial resistance genes, as defined by phenotype, likely groups together suites of functionally heterogenous genes. With the number of mapped partial rust resistance genes increasing rapidly as a result of ongoing advances in marker and sequencing technologies, breeding programs needing to select and prioritize genes for deployment confront a fundamental question: which genes or gene combinations are more likely to provide durable protection against these evolving pathogens? We argue that a refined classification of partial rust resistance genes is required to start answering this question, one based not merely on disease phenotype but also on gene cloning, molecular functional characterization, and interactions with other host and pathogen proteins. Combined with accurate and detailed disease phenotyping and standard genetic studies, an integrated wheat-rust interactome promises to provide the basis for a functional classification of partial resistance genes and thus a conceptual framework for their rational deployment.

AB Over 150 resistance genes that confer resistance to either leaf rust, stripe rust or stem rust have been catalogued in wheat or introgressed into wheat from related species. A few of these genes from the 'slow-rusting' adult plant resistance (APR) class confer partial resistance in a race non-specific manner to one or multiple rust diseases. The recent cloning of two of these genes, Lr34/Yr18, a dual APR for leaf rust and stripe rust, and Yr36, a stripe rust APR gene, showed that they differ from other classes of plant resistance genes. Currently, seven Lr34/Yr18 haplotypes have been identified from sequencing the encoding ATP Binding Cassette transporter gene from diverse wheat germplasm of which one haplotype is commonly associated with the resistance phenotype. The paucity of well characterised APR genes, particularly for stem rust, calls for a focused effort in developing critical genetic stocks to delineate quantitative trait loci, construct specific BAC libraries for targeted APR genes to facilitate robust marker development for breeding applications, and the eventual cloning of the encoding genes.

AB Inheritance of stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) resistance in wheat can be either qualitative or quantitative. While quantitative disease resistance is believed to be more durable, it is more difficult to evaluate if it is expressed only in mature plants, i.e. adult plant resistance (APR). Marker-assisted selection (MAS) methods for APR would be useful; however, the multigenic nature of APR impedes the use of MAS efforts that aim to pyramid only a few target genes. A promising alternative is genomic selection (GS), which utilizes genome-wide marker coverage to predict genotypic values for quantitative traits. In turn, GS can reduce the selection cycle length of a breeding program for traits like APR that could take several seasons to generate reliable phenotypes. In this paper, we describe the GS process for use in crop improvement, both specifically for APR and in general. We also propose a GS-based wheat breeding scheme for quantitative resistance to stem rust that, when compared to current breeding schemes, can reduce cycle time by up to twofold and facilitates pyramiding of major genes with APR genes. Thus, GS could be an important tool for achieving the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative's (BGRI) goal of developing durable stem rust resistance in wheat.

AB The 1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation and a wheat-Triticum timopheevii chromosomal introgression carry the Sr31, Lr26, Yr9 and Pm8 genes and the Sr36/Pm6 gene cluster, respectively. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution and impact of these two translocations in 220 wheat varieties registered in Hungary in the last 35 years until 2005. The 1BL.1RS translocation was introduced into Hungary via wheat cultivars 'Avrora' and 'Kavkaz', which were registered in 1970. New 1BL.1RS cultivars developed in Hungary first appeared in 1982. After reaching a maximum frequency of 50.0% among cultivars registered in Hungary in 1994, their presence declined steadily to 13.3% by 2005. The Sr36/Pm6 cultivars first appeared in 1980. Their frequency quickly reached 31.8% (1983-1984), but then dropped to between 9.6 and 18.5% (1990-2005). The two main Hungarian breeding programs showed opposing trends in the exploitation of these two translocations. In Martonvasar, 1BL.1RS played a dominant role, being present from 1993 to 1997 in ca. 95% of the released cultivars, while at the same time the use of Sr36/Pm6 was marginal. Conversely, among the Szeged cultivars, Sr36/Pm6 was present at high frequency (44.7% in 2002) with a low share of 1BL.1RS. In artificial field inoculation tests (1985-2003) both of the stem rust resistance genes provided significant resistance in all the years, though Sr36 proved more effective than Sr31. While Pm8 was not effective, except for the last 2 years, Pm6 exhibited significant resistance against powdery mildew in most of the 18 years tested. These data may help breeders to assess the usefulness of wheat-rye 1BL.1RS chromosome translocations and the Sr36/Pm6 resistance gene clusters in their future wheat improvement programs.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most important diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). China has the largest stripe rust epidemic areas in the world and yield losses can be large. Aegilops tauschii Coss, the D-genome progenitor of common wheat, includes two subspecies, tauschii and strangulata (Eig) Tzvel. The ssp. strangulata accession AS2388 is highly resistant to the prevailing physiological races of PST in China, and possesses a single dominant gene for stripe rust resistance. In order to tag this gene, AS2388 was crossed with the highly susceptible ssp. tauschii accession AS87. The parents, F(2) plants, and F(2:3) families were tested at adult plant stage in field trials with six currently prevailing races. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. SSR markers Xwmc285 and Xwmc617 were linked to the resistance gene on chromosome arm 4DS flanking it at 1.7 and 34.6 cM, respectively. Based on the chromosomal location, this gene temporarily designated as YrAS2388 is probably novel. The resistance in Ae. tauschii AS2388 was partially expressed in two newly developed synthetic hexaploid backgrounds.

AB The F3 h gene encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylase, one of the key enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, is involved in plant defense response, however, it has not yet been genetically mapped in such important crop species as wheat, barley and rye. In the current study, the F3 h genes were for the first time genetically mapped in these species, using microsatellite and RFLP markers. The three wheat F3 h homoeologous copies F3 h-A1, F3 h-B1 and F3 h-D1, and rye F3 h-R1 were mapped close to the microsatellite loci Xgwm0877 and Xgwm1067 on chromosomes 2AL, 2BL, 2DL, and 2RL, respectively. Wheat F3 h-G1 and barley F3 h-H1 were also mapped at the homoeologous F3 h-1 position on chromosomes 2GL and 2HL, respectively. The non-homoeologous F3 h gene (F3 h-B2) was mapped on wheat chromosome 2BL about 40 cM distal to the F3 h-1 map position. The results obtained in the current study are important for further studies aimed on manipulation with F3 h expression (and, hence, plant defense) in wheat, barley and rye.

AB A mapping population was developed from the two hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding lines MN98550-5 (PI 660540 MAP) and MN99394-1 (PI 660541 MAP) at the University of Minnesota. This population, MN98550-5/MN99394-1 (Reg. No. MP-4, NSL 472873 MAP), comprises 139 F 6: 8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The primary objective of developing this mapping population was to identify the chromosome regions that influence end-use quality traits in hard red spring wheat lines that are adapted to the Upper Midwest region of the USA. The population was genotyped with diversity array technology and simple sequence repeat markers, and the genetic map was composed of 531 marker loci covering all 21 chromosomes of wheat. Forty-three quantitative trait loci (QTL) influenced dough-mixing strength and bread-making properties. This population also segregated for several important traits, including resistance to fungal diseases (leaf rust, caused by Pucciniatriticina f. sp. tritici; and stem rust, caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici), kernel characteristics, and agronomic traits, and their QTL and closely linked markers were identified. The information obtained from QTL analysis was useful in selecting the best RILs as parents in our breeding program.

AB Objective. To study T-helper (Th)1--Th2--Th3 gene activation profile in the small intestine and peripheral blood of children with celiac disease (CD) with special interest in the response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment in order to elucidate an immune dysregulation not triggered by gluten. Material and methods. Small intestinal biopsies and venous blood were taken from seven children with CD (mean age: 8 years, four girls) at presentation and after 1 year of strict GFD. The Th1--Th2--Th3 gene expression profile was examined by real-time PCR arrays. The findings were compared with the corresponding expressions in peripheral blood and small intestinal biopsies from six reference children without CD (mean age: 6 years, four girls). Results. The Th1 gene expression profile including interferon (IFN)-gamma gamma, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 together with reduced interleukin (IL)-2 expression was pronounced in small intestinal biopsies from children with untreated CD. A downregulation of IFN-gamma gamma transcripts was seen after 1 year of GFD, but there was still increased expression of STAT1 and IRF1 in association with low IL-2 expression in spite of eliminated exposure to wheat gluten. By contrast, the decreased intestinal expression of Th2 gene markers observed at presentation was normalized with GFD. The alterations in the mucosal gene expression profile were not reflected in peripheral blood. Conclusion. The GFD did not correct the increased activation of the IFN-gamma gamma signaling pathway related markers and reduced IL-2 expression, suggesting that they represent an immune dysregulation not dependent on gluten exposure.

AB The root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus can cause severe losses in barley cultivation. Multiplication rates had been found to vary greatly between different barley accessions. Two winter barley cultivars, Igri and Franka, had been found to differ in their ability to resist this parasite. An existing Igri x Franka doubled haploid population was chosen to genetically map resistance genes after artificial inoculation with P. neglectus in the greenhouse and climate chamber. A continuous phenotypic variation was found indicating a quantitative inheritance of P. neglectus resistance. An existing map was enriched by 527 newly developed Diversity Array Technology markers (DArTs). The new genetic linkage map was comprised of 857 molecular markers that cover 1,157 cM on seven linkage groups. Using phenotypic data collected from four different experiments in 3 years, five quantitative trait loci were mapped by composite interval mapping on four (3H, 5H, 6H and 7H) linkage groups. A quantitative trait locus with a large phenotypic effect of 16% and likelihood of odds (LOD) score of 6.35 was mapped on linkage group 3H. The remaining four QTLs were classified as minor or moderate with LOD scores ranging from 2.71 to 3.55 and R (2) values ranging from 8 to 10%. The DNA markers linked to the resistance QTLs should be quite useful for marker-assisted selection in barley breeding because phenotypic selection is limited due to time constraints and labor costs.

AB Positional gene isolation in unsequenced species generally requires either a reference genome sequence or an inference of gene content based on conservation of synteny with a genomic model. In the large unsequenced genomes of the Triticeae cereals the latter, i.e. conservation of synteny with the rice and Brachypodium genomes, provides a powerful proxy for establishing local gene content and order. However, efficient exploitation of conservation of synteny requires 'homology bridges' between the model genome and the target region that contains a gene of interest. As effective homology bridges are generally the sequences of genetically mapped genes, increasing the density of these genes around a target locus is an important step in the process. We used bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of transcript abundance data to identify genes located in a specific region of the barley genome. The approach is valuable because only a relatively small proportion of barley genes are currently placed on a genetic map. We analyzed eQTL datasets from the reference Steptoe x Morex doubled haploid population and showed a strong association between differential gene expression and cis-regulation, with 83% of differentially expressed genes co-locating with their eQTL. We then performed BSA by assembling allele-specific pools based on the genotypes of individuals at the partial resistance QTL Rphq11. BSA identified a total of 411 genes as differentially expressed, including HvPHGPx, a gene previously identified as a promising candidate for Rphq11. The genetic location of 276 of these genes could be determined from both eQTL datasets and conservation of synteny, and 254 (92%) of these were located on the target chromosome. We conclude that the identification of differential expression by BSA constitutes a novel method to identify genes located in specific regions of interest. The datasets obtained from such studies provide a robust set of candidate genes for the analysis and serve as valuable resources for targeted marker development and comparative mapping with other grass species.

AB The Oregon Wolfe Barley mapping population is a resource for genetics research and instruction. Prior reports are based on a population of doubled haploid (DH) lines developed by the Hordeum bulbosum (H.b.) method, which samples female gametes. We developed new DH lines from the same cross using anther culture (A.C.), which samples male gametes. Linkage maps were generated in each of the two subpopulations using the same 1,328 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. The linkage maps based on DH lines derived from the products of megasporogeneis and microsporogenesis revealed minor differences in terms of estimated recombination rates. There were no differences in locus ordering. There was greater segregation distortion in the A.C.-derived subpopulation than in the H.b.-derived subpopulation, but in the region showing the greatest distortion, the cause was more likely allelic variation at the ZEO1 plant height locus rather than to DH production method. The effects of segregation distortion and pleiotropy had greater impacts on estimates of quantitative trait locus effect than population size for reproductive fitness traits assayed under greenhouse conditions. The Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) population and data are community resources. Seed is available from three distribution centers located in North America, Europe, and Asia. Details on ordering seed sets, as well as complete genotype and phenotype data files, are available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/maps/OWB/.

AB Stripe rust is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide. To identify new resistance genes is significant in wheat breeding. In this study, stripe rust resistance of a Chinese cultivar Shan 515 was tested with Chinese predominant races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in the seedling stage, and genetic analysis and simple sequence repeats (SSR) technique were used to identify the inheritance model of seedling stripe rust resistance in cultivar Shan 515 and to mark the sites of resistance gene(s) on chromosome. The genetic analysis indicated that the resistance of Shan 515 against Sul 1-4 was conferred by a single dominant gene, which was temporarily designated as YrShan515. Using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and SSR markers, 12 SSR markers (Xwmc335, Xwmc696, Xwmc476, Xbarc267, Xgwm333, Xwmc653, Xwmc396, Xgwm213, Xgwm112 Xgwm274, Xcfd22, Xgwm131, and Xwmc517) located on wheat chromosome 7BL were linked to YrShan515 with genetic distance ranging from 3 to 24 cM. Based on the previously published genetic map and Chinese Spring nulli-tetrascimic analysis, YrShan515 was located on wheat chromosome 7BL. Polymorphism of wheat cultivars collected from Huanghuai wheat grown regions were screened with two markers, Xwmc653 and Xbarc267, and all of these wheat cultivars tested did not present the polymorphic bands as Shan 515 did. Therefore, it suggested that YrShan515 might be a allele of the available yellow rust resistance gene. The mapping of the new resistance gene in Shan 515 is useful for wheat breeding and diversification of resistance genes against stripe rust in commercial wheat cultivars in China.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in bread wheat is a major abiotic constraint reducing yield and influencing the production of high quality grain. In China both spring and winter wheat regions are affected by PHS. Sichuan lies in southwest China, where the most of rainfall occurs during April to September when wheat is harvested. The present investigation was conducted to identify the allelic variability of Vp1, a gene that plays a role in maintenance and induction of dormancy, among Sichuan landraces and recent cultivars with different dormancy levels and to find potential sources of PHS resistance for breeding. Sichuan landrace and cultivar wheat accessions had a wide range of dormancy levels. The average germination index (GI) of Sichuan landrace accessions was 0.232, whereas at 0.674 it was much higher for cultivars. The different dormancy levels between landraces and cultivars indicated that pre-harvest sprouting resistance might have been neglected in recent Sichuan wheat breeding programs. The average GI of white grained accessions was higher than for red grained accessions. Particular Vp-1B gene fragments were specific in landraces or cultivars and in white or red grained accessions. The results indicated that Vp-1B markers could be used to distinguish cultivars and landraces. Significant relationships between certain Vp-1B allelesand GI of Sichuan wheat accessions were shown by Spearman's rank correlation analysis.

AB Coexistence allows growers and consumers the choice of producing or purchasing conventional or organic crops with known standards for adventitious presence of genetically engineered (GE) seed. Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is multipurpose oilseed crop in which product diversity and utility could be enhanced for industrial, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets through genetic engineering. If GE flax were released commercially, pollen-mediated gene flow will determine in part whether GE flax could coexist without compromising other markets. As a part of pre-commercialization risk assessment, we quantified pollen-mediated gene flow between two cultivars of flax. Field experiments were conducted at four locations during 2006 and 2007 in western Canada using a concentric donor (20 x 20 m) receptor (120 x 120m) design. Gene flow was detected through the xenia effect of dominant alleles of high alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3(cis Delta 9,12,15)) to the low ALA trait. Seeds were harvested from the pollen recipient plots up to a distance of 50m in eight directions from the pollen donor. High ALA seeds were identified using a thiobarbituric acid test and served as a marker for gene flow. Binomial distribution and power analysis were used to predict the minimum number of seeds statistically required to detect the frequency of gene flow at specific a (confidence interval) and power (1-beta) values. As a result of the low frequency of gene flow, approximately 4 million seeds were screened to derive accurate quantification. Frequency of gene flow was highest near the source: averaging 0.0185 at 0.1m but declined rapidly with distance, 0.0013 and 0.00003 at 3 and 35 m, respectively. Gene flow was reduced to 50% (O(50)) and 90% (O(90)) between 0.85 to 2.64 m, and 5.68 to 17.56 m, respectively. No gene flow was detected at any site or year > 35m distance from the pollen source, suggesting that frequency of gene flow was <= 0.00003 (P = 0.95). Although it is not possible to eliminate all adventitious presence caused by pollen-mediated gene flow, through harvest blending and the use of buffer zones between GE and conventional flax fields, it could be minimized. Managing other sources of adventitious presence including seed mixing and volunteer populations may be more problematic.

AB Chinese rye cultivar Jingzhouheimai (Secale cereale L.) shows a high level of resistance to powdery mildew. Identification, location, and mapping of the resistance gene would be helpful for developing a highly resistant germplasm or cultivar in wheat. Using sequential C-banding, GISH, and marker analysis, an addition chromosome with powdery mildew resistance was identified in a line derived from a cross between Chinese wheat landrace Huixianhong and rye cultivar Jingzhouheimai. The line, designated H-J DA2RDS1R(1D), had 44 chromosomes including two pairs of rye chromosomes, 1R and 2R, and lacked a pair of wheat chromosomes 1D, that is, it is a double disomic addition disomic substitution line. According to its reaction to different isolates of the powdery mildew pathogen, the resistance gene in H-J DA2RDS1R(1D) differed from the Pm8 and Pm7 genes located earlier on rye chromosomes 1R and 2R, respectively. In order to determine the location of the resistance gene, line H-J DA2RDS1R(1D) was crossed with wheat landrace Huixianhong and the F2 population and corresponding F2:3 families were tested for disease reaction and assessed with molecular markers. The results showed that a resistance gene, designated PmJZHM2RL, is located in rye chromosome arm 2RL.

AB A dominant allele of the vernalization gene Vrn-2 is the wild type conferring winter growth habit, whereas a recessive vrn-2 allele confers spring growth habit. The recessive vrn-2 allele is mutated due to the deletion of the complete gene (a null form) or alternation of a key amino acid in the VRN-2 protein (a nonfunctional form) in diploid wheat or tetraploid wheat. VRN-2 is also denoted ZCCT due to the presence of a zinc finger and a CCT domain in its protein. There are two paralogous ZCCT genes at the VRN-2 locus in diploid Triticum monococcum and three paralogous ZCCT genes on each of the A and B genomes in tetraploid wheat, but little is known about the allelic variation in VRN-2 in hexaploid wheat. In the study reported here, we performed a one-shot PCR to simultaneously amplify the promoter regions of the three ZCCT-1 genes from hexaploid wheat, including the 302-bp fragment from ZCCT-A1, the 294-bp fragment from ZCCT-B1, and the 320-bp fragment from ZCCT-D1. Each amplicon could be differentiated by electrophoresis in an acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel. This PCR marker for different lengths of the three ZCCT-1 genes was used to search for null alleles in hexaploid wheat. A null allele was found in each of ZCCT-A1, ZCCT-B1, and ZCCT-D1 among 74 cultivars and genetic stocks of U.S. hexaploid wheat. Among 54 Chinese wheat cultivars, breeding lines, and landraces, we identified three accessions carrying a single null allele at ZCCT-A1, three accessions carrying a null allele at ZCCT-B1, and one accession carrying a double null allele at both ZCCT-A1 and ZCCT-D1. The potential application of these natural ZCCT-1 mutant materials in wheat breeding programs and studies on the genetics of wheat is discussed.

AB In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), initial studies using deletion lines indicated that crossover (CO) events occur mainly in the telomeric regions of the chromosomes with a possible correlation with the presence of genes. However, little is known about the distribution of COs at the sequence level. To investigate this, we studied in detail the pattern of COs along a contig of 3.110 Mb using two F2 segregating populations (Chinese Spring x Renan (F2-CsRe) and Chinese Spring x Courtot (F2-CsCt)) each containing similar to 2,000 individuals. The availability of the sequence of the contig from Cs enabled the development of 318 markers among which 23 co-dominant polymorphic markers (11 SSRs and 12 SNPs) were selected for CO distribution analyses. The distribution of CO events was not homogeneous throughout the contig, ranging from 0.05 to 2.77 cM/Mb, but was conserved between the two populations despite very different contig recombination rate averages (0.82 cM/Mb in F2-CsRe vs 0.35 cM/Mb in F2-CsCt). The CO frequency was correlated with the percentage of coding sequence in Cs and with the polymorphism rate between Cs and Re or Ct in both populations, indicating an impact of these two factors on CO distribution. At a finer scale, COs were found in a region covering 2.38 kb, spanning a gene coding for a glycosyl transferase (Hga3), suggesting the presence of a CO hotspot. A non-crossover event covering at least 453 bp was also identified in the same interval. From these results, we can conclude that gene content could be one of the factors driving recombination in bread wheat.

AB Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol has been developed for Eleusine coracana (var. PR-202) by varying several factors which influence T-DNA delivery. Green nodular regenerative calli with meristematic nodules of seed origin were used as the target tissue for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. The highest frequency of transformation (44.4%) was observed when callus was infected, co-cultivated and incubated at 22A degrees C. Incorporation of higher level of CuSO(4) in the regeneration medium had significantly positive effect on the recovery of transformed plants. PCR analysis of T (0) and T (1) generation plants with nptII-specific primers revealed the amplification of nptII gene. Southern blot analysis of six regenerated plants confirmed selectable marker gene integration in three plants. This is a first report on Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of finger millet and will pave the way for further studies in this and other millet crops.

AB Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks. (Pst), is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) globally. Use of host resistance is an important strategy to manage the disease. The cultivar Flinor has temperature-sensitive resistance to stripe rust. To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these temperature-sensitive resistances, Flinor was crossed with susceptible cultivar Ming Xian 169. The seedlings of the parents, and F(1), F(3) progeny were screened against Chinese yellow rust race CYR32 in controlled-temperature growth chambers under different temperature regimes. Genetic analysis confirmed two genes for temperature-sensitive stripe rust resistance. A linkage map of SSR markers was constructed using 130 F(3) families derived from the cross. Two temperature-sensitive resistance QTLs were detected on chromosome 5B, designated QYr-tem-5B.1 and QYr-tem-5B.2, respectively, and are separated by a genetic distance of over 50 cM. The loci contributed 33.12 and 37.33% of the total phenotypic variation for infection type, respectively, and up to 70.45% collectively. Favorable alleles of these two QTLs came from Flinor. These two QTLs are temperature-sensitive resistance loci and different from previously reported QTLs for resistance to stripe rust.

Overall, when investigating numerous environments and replications, 40 QTLs were identified in three developmental stages. Based on these loci five QTL clusters were separated, which affect various drought-related traits in at least two developmental stages. Several candidate genes were identified for each QTL cluster using an expressed sequence tag (EST)-based map with high marker density. The putative role of the candidates in drought tolerance is discussed. The phenotypic effect of three of the five candidate genes was also tested on 39 barley landraces and cultivars and a significant relationship was found between the allelic composition of these genes and yield production under stress conditions. This study presents a relevant example of the use of reliable QTL data in the candidate gene approach, while also demonstrating how the results could be practically utilized in marker-assisted selection (MAS).

AB This study aimed to determine whether powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis is an endemic pathogen of triticale (xTriticosecale: Triticum x Secale), emerging as a result of recent changes in its pathogenicity, or whether it is a new pathogen, possibly resulting from hybridization between ff. spp. tritici and secalis. A secondary aim was to consider breeding practices that may have favoured this emergence. Phylogenetic analyses based upon six genes revealed the close relatedness of the novel entity and the ff. spp. tritici and secalis, but the IGS marker finally grouped together the isolates collected on triticale and on wheat, supporting the scenario of a recent host-range expansion from wheat to triticale. Pathotype analyses concluded that virulence spectra of B. graminis infecting triticale were new in comparison to those observed for other reference formae speciales, and lack of fungicide resistance in triticale isolates strengthens the hypothesis of no or little genetic exchange between wheat and triticale populations of powdery mildew. This adaptation may follow the breakdown of plant resistance genes, which are probably not very diverse in current triticale cultivars since this criterion was not considered as a major one until recent years. Moreover, the complex selection and genetics of this hybrid cereal makes it difficult to predict the transmission of powdery mildew resistance genes.

TI Gene discovery in EST sequences from the wheat leaf rust fungus Puccinia
   triticina sexual spores, asexual spores and haustoria, compared to other

AB Background: Rust fungi are biotrophic basidiomycete plant pathogens that cause major diseases on plants and trees world-wide, affecting agriculture and forestry. Their biotrophic nature precludes many established molecular genetic manipulations and lines of research. The generation of genomic resources for these microbes is leading to novel insights into biology such as interactions with the hosts and guiding directions for breakthrough research in plant pathology.
   Results: To support gene discovery and gene model verification in the genome of the wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina (Pt), we have generated Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) by sampling several life cycle stages. We focused on several spore stages and isolated haustorial structures from infected wheat, generating 17,684 ESTs. We produced sequences from both the sexual (pycniospores, aeciospores and teliospores) and asexual (germinated urediniospores) stages of the life cycle. From pycniospores and aeciospores, produced by infecting the alternate host, meadow rue (Thalictrum speciosissimum), 4,869 and 1,292 reads were generated, respectively. We generated 3,703 ESTs from teliospores produced on the senescent primary wheat host. Finally, we generated 6,817 reads from haustoria isolated from infected wheat as well as 1,003 sequences from germinated urediniospores. Along with 25,558 previously generated ESTs, we compiled a database of 13,328 non-redundant sequences (4,506 singlets and 8,822 contigs). Fungal genes were predicted using the EST version of the self-training GeneMarkS algorithm. To refine the EST database, we compared EST sequences by BLASTN to a set of 454 pyrosequencing-generated contigs and Sanger BAC-end sequences derived both from the Pt genome, and to ESTs and genome reads from wheat. A collection of 6,308 fungal genes was identified and compared to sequences of the cereal rusts, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) and stripe rust, P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), and poplar leaf rust Melampsora species, and the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis (Um). While extensive homologies were found, many genes appeared novel and species-specific; over 40% of genes did not match any known sequence in existing databases. Focusing on spore stages, direct comparison to Um identified potential functional homologs, possibly allowing heterologous functional analysis in that model fungus. Many potentially secreted protein genes were identified by similarity searches against genes and proteins of Pgt and Melampsora spp., revealing apparent orthologs.
   Conclusions: The current set of Pt unigenes contributes to gene discovery in this major cereal pathogen and will be invaluable for gene model verification in the genome sequence.

AB Sucrose synthase catalyzes the reaction sucrose+ UDP -> UDP-glucose+fructose, the first step in the conversion of sucrose to starch in endosperm. Previous studies identified two tissue-specific, yet functionally redundant, sucrose synthase (SUS) genes, Sus1 and Sus2. In the present study, the wheat Sus2 orthologous gene (TaSus2) series was isolated and mapped on chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D. Based on sequencing in 61 wheat accessions, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in TaSus2-2B. These formed two haplotypes (Hap-H and Hap-L), but no diversity was found in either TaSus2-2A or TaSus2-2D. Based on the sequences of the two haplotypes, we developed a co-dominant marker, TaSus2-2B(tgw), which amplified 423 or 381-bp fragments in different wheat accessions. TaSus2-2B(tgw) was located between markers Xbarc102.2 and Xbarc91 on chromosome 2BS in a RIL population from Xiaoyan 54x Jing 411. Association analysis suggested that the two haplotypes were significantly associated with 1,000 grain weight (TGW) in 89 modern wheat varieties in the Chinese mini-core collection. Mean TGW difference between the two haplotypes over three cropping seasons was 4.26 g (varying from 3.71 to 4.94 g). Comparative genomics analysis detected major kernel weight QTLs not only in the chromosome region containing TaSus2-2B(tgw), but also in the collinear regions of TaSus2 on rice chromosome 7 and maize chromosome 9. The preferred Hap-H haplotype for high TGW underwent very strong positive selection in Chinese wheat breeding, but not in Europe. The geographic distribution of Hap-H was perhaps determined by both latitude and the intensity of selection in wheat breeding.

AB The mountain rye Secale strictum is native to the Middle East and is the progenitor of the cultivated rye. Regarding lack of information about the genetic diversity of this species in Iran, this study was aimed to evaluate its genetic variation and to examine the patterns of diversity related to the varieties and geography. Fifteen wheat and rye derived microsatellite markers were used to achieve this aim. High levels of diversity, with an average number of 6.1 alleles per locus (ranging up to 11) and high level polymorphism with polymorphism rate averaging 0.624 (between populations) and 0.357 (within populations) were observed among 125 individuals from 19 populations collected from various regions of Iran. The Northwestern populations showed the highest and the Northern populations showed the lowest polymorphism and diversity. One population of the Northwest of the country was notably closer in its allele range to the S. cereale accessions used as outgroup. No taxon or geographic specific marker was detected, suggesting high gene flow between the populations, however some groupings which can be related to the geographic regions and varieties, were evident. The analysis of molecular variance attributed same portions of genetic diversity to the within and between populations with no significant variation among different geographic regions. The results of this study indicated that the Iranian genepool of Secale strictum is valuable to search for new useful alleles for crop improvement.

AB Contemporary trends and perspectives of Chinese winter wheat breeding programs were explored using multiple alleles of gliadin (Gli) and glutenin (Glu)-coding loci as genetic markers. To estimate genetic diversity and specific features of Chinese cultivars, the allele frequencies and genetic diversity H in Chinese wheat pool were calculated and compared to those of cultivars from 11 regions of the world. Among all these cultivars the Chinese ones exhibited the highest allelic diversity of the Gli loci while showing relatively low genetic variability for the Glu loci. Most (96%) of the cultivars examined had unique Gli allele compositions, which enabled to differentiate these cultivars with high precision. Cluster analysis of the genetic distances among the wheats from different regions showed that the Chinese cultivars were close to Italian and Russian ones, sharing with them the common Gli alleles. Clustering of modern cultivars and that of cultivars bred 10-15 years ago was essentially the same. All cultivars from all of the countries examined were classified into three groups according to their quality based on their Glu allele compositions. The Chinese cultivars showed a moderate quality score of 7.0, which conforms to the quality evaluation based on SDS sedimentation. This quality proved to be insufficiently high as compared to cultivars from other countries. However, the genetic diversity estimation suggests that Chinese cultivars have a potential for quality improvement.

AB The Russsian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), is a worldwide pest of cereals. Despite its economic importance, little is known about its genome. Here we investigated physical genomic features in RWA by karyotype analysis using differential staining with AgNO(3), CMA(3), and DAPI, by chromosomal localization of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), H3 and H4 histone genes, and the "arthropod" telomeric sequence (TTAGG) (n) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and by measuring the RWA genome size using flow cytometry. The female karyotype, 2n = 10, is composed of four autosome pairs and a pair of X chromosomes, whereas the male karyotype, 2n = 9, has a single X. The X chromosome is the largest element in the karyotype. All three molecular markers used, i.e., 18S rRNA and both H3 and H4 probes are co-localized at one end of the X chromosome. The FISH probes revealed that the AgNO(3)-positive bridge between two prometaphase X chromosomes of females, which is believed to be responsible for the elimination of one X chromosome in aphid oocytes determined to undergo male development, contains clusters of both histone genes, in addition to an rDNA cluster. Interestingly, RWA lacks the (TTAGG) (n) telomeric sequence in its genome, in contrast to several previously investigated aphid species. Additionally, we compared female and male genome sizes. The female genome size is 2C = 0.86 pg, whereas the male genome size is 2C = 0.70 pg. The difference between the DNA content in the two genders suggests that the RWA X chromosome occupies about 35% of the female haploid genome (1C = 0.43 pg), which makes it one of the largest sex chromosomes in the animal kingdom.

AB Two intervarietal substitution lines of common wheat cv. Sava bearing chromosome 5B from Saratovskaya 29 and Diamant 2 donors and two near-isogenic lines (NILs) of winter cv. Bezostaya 1 with the Vrn-B1 locus from the same donors were developed. Multiple allelism of the dominant Vrn-B1 locus was studied in these lines. It manifested itself as earing time variation in plants grown near Novosibirsk (West Siberia), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and in a greenhouse. One dominant allele, Vrn-B1(S), having a stronger effect on earing time, was detected in Saratovskaya 29 and another, Vrn-B1(Dm), in Diamant 2. The NILs and substitution lines are late-ripening. Lines with Vrn-B1(S) come to earing earlier than with Vrn-B1(Dm).

AB In Hungary, stem rust epidemics caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici are rare, but due to the severity of infection the stem rust fungus can pose a great hazard to wheat production. As new virulent races can appear, it is important for breeders to know of the genetic background of the stem rust resistance in their cultivars. In this study, 220 winter wheat cultivars registered in Hungary in the past 35 years were investigated using molecular markers to determine the presence or absence and frequency of the two important stem rust resistance genes Sr31 and Sr36. The results indicated that both Sr31 and Sr36 genes are widespread in wheat cultivars registered in Hungary. Sr31 was detected in 24.1% of these wheats, and Sr36 in 15.9%. These genes occurred to a somewhat larger extent in the 156 local cultivars: one-third (32.1%) had the Sr31 and 18.0% the Sr36 gene. Of these, 2 cultivars (1.3%) had both genes (Sr31+ Sr36). Among the 64 foreign cultivars only 3 (4.7%) carried the Sr31 gene. In the foreign group, Sr36 was only detected in the seven Croatian cultivars. Tests also revealed possible false pedigrees for some cultivars. Inoculation tests showed that both genes were still effective. One-sixth (16.7%) of stem rust resistant cultivars did not carry the target genes indicating the possible presence of other efficient Sr genes. Data may help breeders to incorporate effective Sr genes into new cultivars.

AB The objectives of this research were to examine the inheritance of leaf rust resistance genes in the Iranian wheat cultivar 'Marvdasht', which is highly resistant to leaf and stripe rusts, and to identify Lr genes present in this cultivar using molecular markers. The genetic basis of resistance to the leaf rust pathogen (Puccinia triticina) in 'Marvdasht' was studied in F(2:3) populations derived from crosses of Bolani (susceptible cultivar) x Marvdasht. Isolates 84-1 and 85-28 of P. triticina, which are the predominant isolates in Iran, were used to examine the segregation of resistance originating from 'Marvdasht'. The results indicated that resistance in 'Marvdasht' to Puccinia triticina isolate 84-1 was governed by two dominant seedling resistance genes Lr1 and Lr17a. Allelism studies using an F2 population derived from a cross between 'Falat' (Seri 82) and Marvdasht indicated that resistance in Marvdasht was not due to the resistance gene Lr26 present in 'Falat'. With the application of a previously developed molecular marker for Lr1, the STS marker RGA-567-5, the presence of Lr1 was verified in Marvdasht. Based on bulk segregant analysis, Lr17a was mapped to the distal end of chromosome 2AS and was closely linked to microsatellite marker Xbarc212 at a distance of 3.7 cM. In conclusion, the presence of Lr1 and Lr17a was confirmed in the cultivar Marvdasht.

AB Wheat yellow rust resistance gene Yr17 was originated from the wheat-Aegilops ventricosa introgression, and still effective on the adult plant in Southern China. The previous studies located the gene Yr17 on the translocation of 2NS-2AS using the molecular and cytological markers. In the present study, we screened new PCR-based markers to map the gene Yr17 region from the investigation of a segregating 120 F2 population. All markers including four EST-PCR markers, a SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) and a PLUG (PCR based landmark unique gene) marker specific to Yr17 gene were mapped on the chromosome 2AS, and located on the chromosomal deletion bin 2AS5-0.8-1.00 region. Based on the wheat-rice collinearity, we found that the sequences of the Yr17 gene linked markers were comparatively matched at rice chromosome 4 and chromosome 7. However, the identified closely linked genomic sequence of Yr17 gene is most likely collinear with genomic region of rice chromosome 4. The newly produced PCR based markers closely linked to Yr17 gene will be useful for the marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding for rust resistance.

AB An F(6) recombinant inbred line (RIL) spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) population derived from RL6071, a stem rust susceptible line, and RL6058, a backcross line of Thatcher wheat with Lr34 that is highly resistant to stem rust, was evaluated for adult plant stem rust resistance in North Dakota in 1999, and in Kenya in 2007 and 2008. In all three tests, most RILs that exhibited low stem rust severity had Lr34 and most lines that had high disease severity lacked Lr34. Molecular mapping with DArT and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers detected a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for adult plant stem rust resistance on chromosome arm 2BL. The RILs with both Lr34 and DArT marker wPt5044 on 2BL had significantly lower stem rust severities compared with lines that only had Lr34 in North Dakota 1999 and Kenya 2008. Marker wPt5044 alone did not significantly increase stem rust resistance. The QTL region on 2BL was not associated with any previously mapped Thatcher seedling stem rust resistance genes. The stem rust resistance in Thatcher enhanced by the presence of Lr34 is effective to different races in North America and Kenya and mapped to the same QTL.

AB P>Monitoring nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in plants is becoming essential to maintain yield while reducing fertilizer usage. Optimized NUE application in major crops is essential for long-term sustainability of agriculture production. Here, we report the precise identification of 11 major chromosomal regions controlling NUE in wheat that co-localise with key developmental genes such as Ppd (photoperiod sensitivity), Vrn (vernalization requirement), Rht (reduced height) and can be considered as robust markers from a molecular breeding perspective. Physical mapping, sequencing, annotation and candidate gene validation of an NUE metaQTL on wheat chromosome 3B allowed us to propose that a glutamate synthase (GoGAT) gene that is conserved structurally and functionally at orthologous positions in rice, sorghum and maize genomes may contribute to NUE in wheat and other cereals. We propose an evolutionary model for the NUE locus in cereals from a common ancestral region, involving species specific shuffling events such as gene deletion, inversion, transposition and the invasion of repetitive elements.

TI An accurate DNA marker assay for stem rust resistance gene Sr2 in wheat
SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
LA English
DT Article
ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; IDENTIFICATION; CULTIVARS
AB The stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided broad-spectrum protection against stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici) since its wide spread deployment in wheat from the 1940s. Because Sr2 confers partial resistance which is difficult to select under field conditions, a DNA marker is desirable that accurately predicts Sr2 in diverse wheat germplasm. Using DNA sequence derived from the vicinity of the Sr2 locus, we developed a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker that is associated with the presence or absence of the gene in 115 of 122 (95%) diverse wheat lines. The marker genotype predicted the absence of the gene in 100% of lines which were considered to lack Sr2. Discrepancies were observed in lines that were predicted to carry Sr2 but failed to show the CAPS marker. Given the high level of accuracy observed, the marker provides breeders with a selection tool for one of the most important disease resistance genes of wheat.

AB A high-resolution chromosome arm-specific mapping population was used in an attempt to locate/detect gene(s)/QTL for different root traits on the short arm of rye chromosome 1 (1RS) in bread wheat. This population consisted of induced homoeologous recombinants of 1RS with 1BS, each originating from a different crossover event and distinct from all other recombinants in the proportions of rye and wheat chromatin present. It provides a simple and powerful approach to detect even small QTL effects using fewer progeny. A promising empirical Bayes method was applied to estimate additive and epistatic effects for all possible marker pairs simultaneously in a single model. This method has an advantage for QTL analysis in minimizing the error variance and detecting interaction effects between loci with no main effect. A total of 15 QTL effects, 6 additive and 9 epistatic, were detected for different traits of root length and root weight in 1RS wheat. Epistatic interactions were further partitioned into inter-genomic (wheat and rye alleles) and intra-genomic (rye-rye or wheat-wheat alleles) interactions affecting various root traits. Four common regions were identified involving all the QTL for root traits. Two regions carried QTL for almost all the root traits and were responsible for all the epistatic interactions. Evidence for inter-genomic interactions is provided. Comparison of mean values supported the QTL detection.

AB Previous studies of gene-flow in agriculture have used a range of physical and biochemical markers, including transgenes. However, physical and biochemical markers are not available for all commercial varieties, and transgenes are difficult to use when trying to estimate gene flow in the field where the use of transgenes is often restricted. Here, we demonstrate the use of simple sequence repeat microsatellite markers (SSRs) to study gene flow in maize. Developing the first quantitative analysis of pooled SSR samples resulted in a high sampling efficiency which minimised the use of resources and greatly enhanced the possibility of hybrid detection. We were able to quantitatively distinguish hybrids in pools of ten samples from non-hybrid parental lines in all of the 24 pair-wise combinations of commercial varieties tested. The technique was used to determine gene flow in field studies, from which a simple model describing gene flow in maize was developed.

AB One of the key targets of breeding programs in bread wheat is to improve the end-use quality. The relationships between quantities of protein fractions and dough rheological characters have been well established, but there is little information on the genetic control of quantities of protein fractions. Two hundred and forty F-6 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two Chinese wheat cultivars, PH82-2 and Neixiang 188, were sown at Jiaozuo in Henan province in the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 cropping seasons, and inclusive composite interval mapping was used to dissect main effect quantitative trait loci (M-QTLs) and digenic epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) for quantities of protein fractions. A total of 55 M-QTLs and 77 pairs of E-QTLs affecting the quantities of protein fractions including GLU-A1 (QGA1), GLU-B1 (QGB1), GLU-D1 (QGD1), HMW-GS (QHMW), GLU-A3 (QGA3), GLU-B3 (QGB3), LMW-GS (QLMW), glutenin (QGLU) and the ratio of the quantity of glutenin to those of gliadin were identified, with M-QTLs contributing 39.3-95.6% of the phenotypic variance explained (PVE), and E-QTLs accounting for 1.4-33.5% of the PVE. Among the M-QTLs, 33 were consistent in two seasons and in the mean value of two seasons with similar effects in both magnitude and direction, including major genes on HMW and LMW glutenin loci linked to Sec1 and Glu-B1c, Glu-D1d, Glu-A3a, and grain hardness locus Ha, indicating that these genes were the most important determinants of gluten strength, and they might have significant effects on dough properties not only through effects on allelic composition, but also by influencing quantities of protein fractions. The effects of E-QTLs were more influenced by environments, compared with those of M-QTLs, with only two pairs of E-QTLs consistent in two seasons and in the mean value of two seasons. The M-QTLs were detected in 12 marker intervals, all of which involved E-QTLs on quantities of protein fractions, whereas only 40 of 77 pairs of E-QTLs involved intervals in which M-QTLs were detected. The results indicated that besides main effects, epistatic effects were also important factors in determining quantities of protein fractions in wheat.

AB Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schult. is a diploid wild South American barley that contains genes of interest for cereal breeding, many of them located on chromosome 1H(ch). In the current study, two H. chilense-wheat addition lines with deletions in the 1H(ch) chromosome were used for sub-arm localization of five prolamin (glutenin and gliadin) loci and 33 EST-SSR marker loci on chromosome 1H(ch). The two sets of markers were distributed across five sub-arm chromosome regions. Three glutenin loci (Glu-H (ch) 2, Glu-H (ch) 3, Glu-H (ch) 4) together with the gliadin locus Gli-H (ch) 1 were located on the distal 20% of the 1H(ch)S arm, whereas the glutenin locus Glu-H (ch) 1 was on the proximal 88% region of 1H(ch)L. Among 33 EST-SSR marker loci, 7 (21.2%) were on the 1H(ch)S arm and, of them, 3 (9.1%) were on the distal 20% end and 4 (12.1%) on the proximal 80% region. The 26 loci (78.8%) on 1H(ch)L were distributed across three different regions: 18 (78.8%) in the proximal 88%, 3 (9.1%) in the distal 12% and 5 (15.2%) in a region less than 12% from the distal end. The deletions in the 1H(ch) chromosome added to the common wheat background were thus shown to be useful for determining the sub-arm location of EST-SSR and prolamin loci. This could facilitate the identification of molecular markers linked to genes of agronomic interest and the isolation of such genes for use in common wheat improvement.

AB In wheat, the use of gene "pyramids" or "stacks" of major genes that confer resistance to all local strains of the fungal stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) can increase durability of resistance where wheat cultivars with the single gene components are not widely deployed. Stacking two or more resistance genes becomes a breeding challenge, particularly when pathogen races that discriminate the genes are not available. The use of DNA markers and doubled-haploid technology provides a route for producing lines homozygous for multiple resistance genes. We have applied this approach to produce gene pyramids of two or more of the stem rust resistance genes Sr24 and new sources of SrR, Sr31 and Sr26 on reduced alien chromatin in the genetic backgrounds of Westonia and Pavon wheat. These genes, which are all derived from "alien" sources (SrR and Sr31 from rye, Sr24 and Sr26 from Agropyron elongatum) each provide resistance to all currently known pathotypes of Pgt in Australia, and SrR and Sr26 also provide resistance against all the variants of stem rust race Ug99 (TTKS group).

AB Seedlings of selected six genotypes of maize (Zea mays L.) differing in their drought sensitivity (LM5 and Parkash drought-tolerant and PMH2, JH3459, Paras and LM14 as drought-sensitive) were exposed to 72 h drought stress at two leaf stage. Alterations in their antioxidant pools combined with activities of enzymes involved in defense against oxidative stress were investigated in leaves. Activities of some reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes, catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were enhanced in tolerant genotypes in response to drought stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly decreased in sensitive genotypes, but remained unchanged in tolerant genotypes under stress. Peroxidase (POX) activity was significantly induced in tolerant, as well as sensitive genotypes. Imposition of stress led to increase in H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker for lipid peroxidation) content in sensitive genotypes, while in tolerant genotypes no change was observed. Significant increase in glutathione content was observed in sensitive genotypes. Ascorbic acid pool was induced in both tolerant and sensitive genotypes, but induction was more pronounced in tolerant genotypes. Significant activation of antioxidative defence mechanisms correlated with drought-induced oxidative stress tolerance was the characteristic of the drought tolerant genotypes. These studies provide a mechanism for drought tolerance in maize seedlings.

AB Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), caused by Phaeosphaeria nodorum, is one of the most devastating foliar diseases on wheat (Triticum aestivum L) in the northern Great Plains of North America. This study was conducted, under controlled environmental conditions, to elucidate the genetics and map the resistance to SNB caused by spore inoculum and culture filtrate of P nodorum isolate Sn2000. A hard red spring wheat population was developed from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Steele-ND and the resistant line ND 735 for this study. Two-leaf seedlings of the parents, F(1) and F(2) generations, and F(2:6) recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) were inoculated with spore suspensions while independent two week old seedlings of segregating generations were infiltrated with culture filtrate. Disease reaction was assessed 8 days after inoculation based on a lesion-type scale while plants were evaluated for culture filtrate response four days after infiltration for the presence or absence of necrosis. Genetic analysis revealed that a single recessive gene, Tsn1, in ND 735 confers resistance to both spore suspension and culture filtrate of P. nodorum isolate Sn2000. Mapping analysis using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers indicates the gene, Tsn1, is located on the long arm of chromosome 5B and is flanked by the DArt markers wPt-8285 and wPt-3049 at a distance of 7.0 cM and 2.9 cM, respectively. This gene also controls resistance to tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis race 2. Results of this study reveal that wheat-P nodorum interaction follows the toxin model of gene-for-gene hypothesis. Additionally, the finding of single gene control in the line ND 735 for both tan spot and SNB enhances the utility of the line ND 735 in wheat breeding program as a source of multiple disease resistance.

AB The genus Alternaria is considered one of the most important fungal contaminants of vegetables, fruits, and cereals, producing several mycotoxins that can withstand food processing methods. Conventional methods for Alternaria identification and enumeration are laborious and time-consuming, and they might not detect toxigenic molds inactivated by food processing. In this study, a PCR method has been developed for the rapid identification of Alternaria spp. DNA in foodstuffs, based on oligonucleotide primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and ITS2 regions of the rRNA gene. The specificity of the Alternaria-specific primer pair designed (Dir1ITSAlt-Inv1ITSAlt) was verified by PCR analysis of DNA from various Alternaria spp., and also from several fungal, bacterial, yeast, animal, and plant species. The detection limit of the method was 10(2) CFU/ml in viable culture, heated culture, or experimentally inoculated tomato pulp. The applicability of the method for detection of Alternaria spp. DNA in foodstuffs was assessed by testing several commercial samples. Alternaria DNA was detected in 100% of spoiled tomato samples, 8% of tomato products, and 36.4% of cereal-based infant food samples analyzed.

AB The aim of experiment was to analyze the polymerization effect of genotypes and genotype combinations of PRLR and LH beta gene loci in Xinong Saanen goat by SSCP marker and family trees. The relationships of genotype combinations and litter size were compared in Xinong Saanen goat. The results indicate that there are genetic polymorphisms at the PRLR and LH beta gene loci, and there are 4 positive genotypes (GG, CC, PP and LL) and 4 negative genotypes (HH, DD, QQ and MM) effects on litter size, respectively in Xinong Saanen goat. Compared with the other genotype combinations, the polymerization effect of GGCCPPLL markedly improved (P < 0.05). The polymerization effect value of CC genotype was higher than that of CD genotype by 14.12%, and MM genotype was higher than that of LM genotype by 3.80%, and PP genotype was higher than that of QQ genotype by 15.67%, and LL genotype was higher than that of LM genotype by 11.48%, and PQ genotype was higher than that of QQ genotype by 11.02%, and CD genotype was higher than that of DD genotype by 10.69%, and PQ genotype was higher than that of PP genotype by 6.09%. There was significantly polymerization effect in the course of reproduction from parental generation (F0) to F1 generation. However, there was significantly gene isolation effect in the course of reproduction from F1 generation to F2 generation. This result can be used to guide the goat breeding in polyembryony trait.

AB Changes in animal nutrition, particularly essential dietary components, alter global gene expression patterns. Our goal is to identify molecular markers that serve as early indicators of the quality of insect culture media. Markers of deficient culture media will increase the efficiency of developing optimal systems for mass rearing beneficial insects and some pest species because decisions on culture media quality can be made without waiting through one or several life cycles. The objective of our current study is to discover molecular markers of essential dietary lipid deficiency in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. We reared groups of fruit flies separately on media either devoid of or supplemented with wheat germ oil (WGO) and analyzed gene expression in third instar larvae and F(1) eggs using 2D electrophoresis. Gel densitometry revealed significant changes in expression levels of genes encoding eight proteins in larvae and 22 proteins in eggs. We identified these proteins by using mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF) and bioinformatic analyses of the protein sequences. Among these, we identified one gene encoding the receptor of activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) that increased in expression by 6.8-fold in eggs from adults that were reared as larvae on media supplemented with WGO. RACK1 is an essential component of at least three intracellular signal transduction pathways, making it a good molecular marker candidate of lipid deficiency in fruit flies and possibly many other insect species.

AB Adult plant resistance to stripe (yellow) rust in the wheat cultivar Kariega has previously been ascribed to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on each of chromosomes 2B and 7D, along with a number of minor QTL. We have extended both the size of the cv. Kariega x cv. Avocet S mapping population, and the marker coverage within it, by assembling a set of Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers. This has allowed for the analysis of the genetic basis of the adult plant and seedling resistances to stripe, leaf and stem rust present in the two mapping population parents. The stripe rust reactions of the segregating material were assessed in both field (three scoring dates) and greenhouse experiments. The chromosome 2B QTL became more important than the Lr34/Yr18 complex on chromosome 7D as the plants aged. As the infection progressed, the two QTL explained an increasing proportion of the variance for percentage leaf area infected. The cv. Kariega allele at the minor chromosome 4A QTL had a consistent effect on the severity of stripe rust infection and the overall plant reaction at the earlier scoring dates, but lost importance as the disease progressed. Several rust resistances were detected using an improved greenhouse-based test.

AB P>Eyespot, caused by Oculimacula acuformis and O. yallundae, is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The two pathogens generate similar symptoms and cannot be distinguished visually. In order to distinguish O. acuformis and O. yallundae infections and to identify reliable quantitative differences in the level of resistance of wheat genotypes, two SYBR Green based real-time PCR assays were developed. The influence of time after inoculation until sample collection, the effect of species (O. acuformis, O. yallundae), and the relevance of wheat cultivars carrying Pch1, Pch2, or none of the resistance genes on the pathogen-DNA content were analysed. The most clear-cut difference of pathogen content between resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes was obtained 12 weeks after inoculation with O. yallundae. Growth chamber tests using artificial inoculation with O. yallundae and sampling 12 weeks after inoculation for real-time PCR is shown to be a reliable procedure to determine the resistance level of wheat against eyespot. Likewise, this is the basis for the development of efficient molecular markers.

AB P>The recessive adult plant leaf rust resistance (APR) gene Lr48 in CSP44 was tagged using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The population was phenotyped under controlled conditions using pathotype 77-5 (121R63-1) at both seedling and adult plant stages. Four microsatellite markers Xwmc175, Xwmc332, Xwmc627 and Xwmc149 were linked to Lr48 and mapped to chromosome 2BL with distances of 10.3, 2.5, 12.6 and 20.7 cM from Lr48 covering a length of 31 cM. Lr48 was placed between markers Xwmc175 and Xwmc332. The earlier reported location of Lr48 on 2BS could not be confirmed. The markers were validated on another population and the closest SSR marker, Xwmc332, was specific to resistance allele Lr48 and did not amplify in wheat lines carrying other resistance genes, thus enabling breeders to pyramid Lr48 with other leaf rust resistance genes.

AB P>Fungal diseases of wheat, including powdery mildew (Pm), have caused significant crop, yield and quality losses throughout the world and continue to impact on production. Knowledge of the genetic basis of powdery mildew resistance of wheat cultivars will greatly support future efforts developing and cultivating resistant cultivars. Genetic studies were conducted on the German winter wheat cultivar 'Cortez' to identify genes involved in powdery mildew resistance at seedling and adult plant growth stages using doubled haploid (DH) population Atlantis/Cortez. Analysis of association between molecular markers and powdery mildew severity in selected genotypes indicated the involvement of two genes on chromosomes 1A and 7B in seedling resistance. The same gene on chromosome 1A was also found to be effective at adult plant stage. Quantitative trait loci analysis corroborated that the gene on chromosome 1A significantly contributed to field resistance in all five test environments and explained between 22.9% and 51.4% of the total phenotypic variation. The gene on chromosome 7B was identified as Pm5, whereas the gene on chromosome 1A potentially conditioning resistance was identified as Pm3e.

AB The leaf rust resistance gene Lr19 and Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) derived from the wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum ponticum have been located on chromosome 7E. The main objectives of the present study were to develop a genetic map of chromosome 7E and map the two resistance loci using a population of 237 F(7:8) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two Thatcher-L. ponticum substitution lines, K11463 (7el(1)(7D)) and K2620 (7el(2)(7D)). 532 G-SSR, E-SSR and STS markers from wheat chromosome group 7 were screened in the parent lines. Of these, 118 markers were polymorphic, with a polymorphism frequency of 22.2%. A genetic map of L. ponticum chromosome 7E was constructed with 64 markers, covering 95.76 cM, with an average genetic distance of 1.47 cM between markers. The major FHB resistance locus, temporarily assigned as FhbLoP, was mapped to the very distal region of the long arm of chromosome 7E within a 3.71 cM interval flanked by Xcfa2240 and Xswes19, which accounts for 30.46% of the phenotypic variance. Lr19 was bracketed by Xwmc273 and XBE404744, with a map distance of 1.54 and 1.43 cM from either side, respectively. The closely linked markers identified in this study will be helpful for marker-assisted introgression of the L. ponticum-derived FhbLoP and Lr19 genes into elite cultivars of wheat, and the development of a genetic map will accelerate the map-based cloning of these two genes.

TI Mapping of the oat crown rust resistance gene Pc91

AB Crown rust is an important disease of oat caused by Puccinia coronata Corda f. sp. avenae Eriks. Crown rust is efficiently and effectively managed through the development of resistant oat varieties. Pc91 is a seedling crown rust resistance gene that is highly effective against the current P. coronata population in North America. The primary objective of this study was to develop DNA markers linked to Pc91 for purposes of marker-assisted selection in oat breeding programs. The Pc91 locus was mapped using a population of F7-derived recombinant inbred lines developed from the cross 'CDC Sol-Fi'/'HiFi' made at the Crop Development Centre, University of Saskatchewan. The population was evaluated for reaction to P. coronata in field nurseries in 2008 and 2009. Pc91 mapped to a linkage group consisting of 44 Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers. DArTs were successfully converted to sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Five robust SCARs were developed from three non-redundant DArTs that co-segregated with Pc91. SCAR markers were developed for different assay systems, such that SCARs are available for agarose gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and Taqman single nucleotide polymorphism detection. The SCAR markers accurately postulated the Pc91 status of 23 North American oat breeding lines.

AB The rust resistance genes Lr53 and Yr35, transferred to common wheat from Triticum dicoccoides, were reported previously to be completely linked on chromosome 6B. Four F (3) families were produced from a cross between a line carrying Lr53 and Yr35 (98M71) and the leaf rust and stripe rust susceptible genotype Avocet "S" and were rust tested using Puccinina triticina pathotype 53-1,(6),(7),10,11 and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotype 110 E143 A+. The homozygous resistant lines produced infection types of ";1-aEuroe and ";N" to these pathotypes, respectively. The Chi-squared tests indicated goodness-of-fit of the data for one leaf rust gene and one stripe rust gene segregation. Linkage analysis using this population demonstrated recombination of 3% between the genes. Microsatellite markers located on the short arm of chromosome 6B were used to map the genes, with the markers cfd1 and gwm508 being mapped approximately 1.1 and 4.5 cM, respectively, proximal to Lr53. Additional studies of the relationship between Lr36, also located on the short arm of chromosome 6B, and Lr53 indicated that the two genes were independent.

AB We carried out a genome-wide analysis of polymorphism (4,596 SNP loci across 190 elite cultivated accessions) chosen to represent the available genetic variation in current elite North West European and North American barley germplasm. Population sub-structure, patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium varied considerably across the seven barley chromosomes. Gene-rich and rarely recombining haplotype blocks that may represent up to 60% of the physical length of barley chromosomes extended across the 'genetic centromeres'. By positioning 2,132 bi-parentally mapped SNP markers with minimum allele frequencies higher than 0.10 by association mapping, 87.3% were located to within 5 cM of their original genetic map position. We show that at this current marker density genetically diverse populations of relatively small size are sufficient to fine map simple traits, providing they are not strongly stratified within the sample, fall outside the genetic centromeres and population sub-structure is effectively controlled in the analysis. Our results have important implications for association mapping, positional cloning, physical mapping and practical plant breeding in barley and other major world cereals including wheat and rye that exhibit comparable genome and genetic features.

AB In fragmented populations, genetic drift and selection reduce genetic diversity, which in turn results in a loss of fitness or in a loss of evolvability. Genetic rescue, that is, controlled input of diversity from distant populations, may restore evolutionary potential, whereas outbreeding depression might counteract the positive effect of this strategy. We carried out self-pollination and crosses within and between populations in an experimental subdivided population of a selfing species, Triticum aestivum L., to estimate the magnitude of these two phenomena. Surprisingly, for a self-fertilizing species, we found significant inbreeding depression within each population for four of the six traits studied, indicating that mildly deleterious mutations were still segregating in these populations. The progeny of within-and between-population crosses was very similar, indicating low between-population heterosis and little outbreeding depression. We conclude that relatively large population effective sizes prevented fixation of a high genetic load and that local adaptation was limited in these recently diverged populations. The kinship coefficient estimated between the parents using 20 neutral markers was a poor predictor of the progeny phenotypic values, indicating that there was a weak link between neutral diversity and genes controlling fitness-related traits. These results show that when assessing the viability of natural populations and the need for genetic rescue, the use of neutral markers should be complemented with information about the presence of local adaptation in the subdivided population.

AB The MCMC procedure in SAS (called PROC MCMC) is particularly designed for Bayesian analysis using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The program is sufficiently general to handle very complicated statistical models and arbitrary prior distributions. This study introduces the SAS/MCMC procedure and demonstrates the application of the program to quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A real life QTL mapping experiment in wheat female fertility trait was used as an example for the demonstration. The fertility trait phenotypes were described under three different models: (1) the Poisson model, (2) the Bernoulli model and (3) the zero-truncated Poisson model. One QTL was identified on the second chromosome. This QTL appears to control the switch of seed-producing ability of female plants but does not affect the number of seeds produced once the switch is turned on.

AB To enhance the sustainability of agriculture it is imperative that the use of P-fertilisers by temperate cereal crops be improved. This can be achieved both by agronomic and genetic approaches. While many studies have demonstrated genotypic variation in P-use efficiency in a number of cereal species the robustness of this genetic variation in contrasting environments is rarely considered. In this paper we describe an experiment in which we compare the P-nutrition of winter and spring barley genotypes from an association genetic-mapping population grown in a field trial with different cultivation treatments (conventional plough vs. minimum tillage) which had been established over a number of years. We demonstrate that, while there is significant variation between genotypes in their P nutrition, this variation is not comparable between cultivation treatments and only one winter barley genotype (cv. Gleam) has beneficial P-use efficiency traits in both cultivation systems. Analysis of the association genetic-mapping population demonstrated that there was a strong environmental component in the genotypic variation, with more significant associations of shoot P concentration with known SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers when the population was grown in minimum tillage treatments. These data suggest that it may be possible to identify genetic components to variation in P nutrition in barley, but that a large interaction with environmental variables may limit the usefulness of any genes or markers discovered for improving P-use efficiency to the conditions under which the screening was performed.

AB Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causative agent of stem rust in wheat, is known for its high virulence variability and ability to evolve new virulence to resistance genes. Thus, pyramiding of several resistance genes in a single line is the best strategy for a sustainable control of wheat stem rust. Sr13 is one of the few resistance genes that are effective against wide ranging P. graminis f. sp. tritici races, including the pestilent race Ug99. Its effectiveness to Ug99 makes it a valuable source for resistance to stem rust. Molecular markers play a pivotal role in the genetic characterization of the new sources of resistance as well as in stacking two or more resistance genes in a single line. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop molecular markers for Sr13 facilitating efficient pyramiding of Sr genes. Based on the 158 F(2) individuals derived from a cross of Khapstein/9*LMPG x Morocco and SSR analyses, the Sr13 locus was mapped on chromosome 6A of wheat, and a genetic map comprising about 90 cM was constructed with the closest marker barc37 being located 4.0 cM distally of Sr13. Of the nine mapped markers, barc37 amplified an allele specific for the presence of Sr13 as shown by testing different cultivars and breeding lines. These newly developed markers will increase the efficiency of incorporating Sr13 into cultivars that are widely adopted, but susceptible to hazardous Ug99 and/or assist for the development of new elite lines that are resistant to Ug99.

AB Flowering time in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is controlled by vernalization and photoperiod response, and earliness per se genes. The genetic basis of flowering time has not been investigated in Pakistani bread wheat. This study was, therefore, conducted to determine the allelic composition at Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, Vrn-B3 and Ppd-D1a loci of 59 Pakistani spring bread wheat cultivars. These cultivars, along with 4 isogenic lines for vernalization genes were characterized with previously reported DNA markers designed for detecting allelic variation at 4 Vrn (Vernalization) and 1 Ppd (Photoperiod) loci. Spring habit Vrn-A1a allele was found in 36% cultivars either alone or with spring habit Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 alleles. Two wheat cultivars had the dominant Vrn-A1c allele, whereas none of the cultivars had Vrn-A1b. Spring habit Vrn-B1 was the most frequent allele (64%) present either alone or with Vrn-A1a, Vrn-A1c and Vrn-D1. Spring habit Vrn-D1 was found in 61% cultivars. Vrn-D1 was singly found in 25% cultivars and along with Vrn-B1 in 29% cultivars. Dominant Vrn-B3 was absent in all cultivars studied. All cultivars except Era had the photoperiod insensitive allele Ppd-D1a. We did not find any association between the flowering time and Vrn allelic composition of the studied cultivars. This indicated that the partial vernalization requirement of cultivars with Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 alleles is probably fulfilled during Pakistani growing season. Earliness per se and the photoperiod sensitive loci other than Ppd-D1 need to be investigated to further understand the genetic basis of flowering time in Pakistani wheat.

AB Barley grain yield in rainfed Mediterranean regions can be largely influenced by terminal drought events. In this study the ecophysiological performance of the 'Nure' (winter) x 'Tremois' (spring) barley mapping population (118 Doubled Haploids, DHs) was evaluated in a multi-environment trial of eighteen site-year combinations across the Mediterranean Basin during two consecutive harvest years (2004 and 2005). Mean grain yield of sites ranged from 0.07 to 5.43 t ha(-1), clearly dependent upon both the total water input (rainfall plus irrigation) and the water stress index (WSI) accumulated during the growing season. All DHs were characterized for possessing molecular marker alleles tagging four genes that regulate barley cycle, i.e. Vrn-H1, Vrn-H2, Ppd-H2 and Eam6. Grain yield differences were initially interpreted in terms of mean differences between genotypes (G), environments (E), and for each combination of genotype and environment (GE) through a "full interaction" ANOVA model. Variance components estimates clearly showed the greater importance of GE over G, although both were much lower than E. Alternative linear and bilinear models of increasing complexity were used to describe GE. A linear model fitting allelic variation at the four genes explained genotype main effect and genotype x environment interaction much better than growth habit itself. Adaptation was primarily driven by the allelic constitution at three out of the four segregating major genes, i.e. Vrn-H1, Ppd-H2 and Eam6. In fact, the three genes together explained 47.2% of G and 26.3% of GE sum of squares. Grain yield performance was more determined by the number of grains per unit area than by the grain weight (phenotypic correlation across all genotypic values: r = 0.948 and 0.559, respectively). The inter-relationships among a series of characters defining grain yield and its components were also explored as a function of the length of the different barley developmental phases. i.e. vegetative, reproductive, and grain filling stages. In most environments, the best performing (adapted) genotypes were those with faster development until early occurrence of anthesis. This confirmed the crucial role of the period defining the number of grains per unit-area in grain yield determination under Mediterranean environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Rye (Secale cereale L.) is the most frost tolerant cereal species. As an outcrossing species, rye exhibits high levels of intraspecific diversity, which makes it well-suited for allele mining in genes involved in the frost responsive network. For investigating genetic diversity and the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) we analyzed eleven candidate genes and 37 microsatellite markers in 201 lines from five Eastern and Middle European rye populations.
   Results: A total of 147 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nine insertion-deletion polymorphisms were found within 7,639 bp of DNA sequence from eleven candidate genes, resulting in an average SNP frequency of 1 SNP/52 bp. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity of candidate genes were high with average values pi = 5.6 x 10(-3) and Hd = 0.59, respectively. According to an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), most of the genetic variation was found between individuals within populations. Haplotype frequencies varied markedly between the candidate genes. ScCbf14, ScVrn1, and ScDhn1 were dominated by a single haplotype, while the other 8 genes (ScCbf2, ScCbf6, ScCbf9b, ScCbf11, ScCbf12, ScCbf15, ScIce2, and ScDhn3) had a more balanced haplotype frequency distribution. Intra-genic LD decayed rapidly, within approximately 520 bp on average. Genome-wide LD based on microsatellites was low.
   Conclusions: The Middle European population did not differ substantially from the four Eastern European populations in terms of haplotype frequencies or in the level of nucleotide diversity. The low LD in rye compared to self-pollinating species promises a high resolution in genome-wide association mapping. SNPs discovered in the promoters or coding regions, which attribute to non-synonymous substitutions, are suitable candidates for association mapping.

AB Asparagus bean (Vigna. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis) is a distinctive subspecies of cowpea [Vigna. unguiculata (L.) Walp.] that apparently originated in East Asia and is characterized by extremely long and thin pods and an aggressive climbing growth habit. The crop is widely cultivated throughout Asia for the production of immature pods known as 'long beans' or 'asparagus beans'. While the genome of cowpea ssp. unguiculata has been characterized recently by high-density genetic mapping and partial sequencing, little is known about the genome of asparagus bean. We report here the first genetic map of asparagus bean based on SNP and SSR markers. The current map consists of 375 loci mapped onto 11 linkage groups (LGs), with 191 loci detected by SNP markers and 184 loci by SSR markers. The overall map length is 745 cM, with an average marker distance of 1.98 cM. There are four high marker-density blocks distributed on three LGs and three regions of segregation distortion (SDRs) identified on two other LGs, two of which co-locate in chromosomal regions syntenic to SDRs in soybean. Synteny between asparagus bean and the model legume Lotus. japonica was also established. This work provides the basis for mapping and functional analysis of genes/QTLs of particular interest in asparagus bean, as well as for comparative genomics study of cowpea at the subspecies level.

AB Analysis of DNA sequence variation among genotypes is useful for differentiation of wheat accessions, selection strategies and genetic development of crop plants. We screened molecular markers for yellow rust resistance genes (Yr7, Yr9, Yr15, Yr18, Yr26, and YrH52), which are in the gene-rich regions of wheat chromosomes 1B, 2B, and 7D, to investigate DNA sequence differences and repeat motifs and numbers between wheat cultivars resistant (Izgi2001, Sonmez2001, PI178383) and susceptible (Aytin98, ES14, Harmankaya99) to yellow rust. The F-2 individuals derived from the crosses were evaluated for yellow rust resistance at both the seedling and adult stages to identify DNA markers genetically linked to yellow rust resistance. The most repeated motif was found to be GA and the least repeated motif TAGA among the cultivars. When we examined DNA sequence differences (insertion, deletion and single nucleotide changes), the molecular markers Xgwm526 (Yr7) and Xgwm273 (YrH52) were found to have the most conserved regions and Yr15 (Xgwm413) the least conserved regions among the cultivars. This DNA sequence information can be used for selection of suitable parents, creating mapping populations and developing molecular markers associated with yellow rust resistance in plant breeding programs.

AB A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for the A-genome of cotton has been constructed from the leaves of G. arboreum L cv. Jianglinzhongmian. It is used as elite A-genome germplasm resources in the present cotton breeding program and has been used to build a genetic reference map of cotton. The BAC library consists of 123,648 clones stored in 322 384-well plates. Statistical analysis of a set of 103 randomly selected BAC clones indicated that each clone has an average insert length of 100.2 kb per plasmid, with a range of 30 to 190 kb. Theoretically, this represents 7.2 haploid genome equivalents based on an A-genome size of 1697 Mb. The BAC library has been arranged in column pools and superpools allowing screening with various PCR-based markers. In the future, the A-genome cotton BAC library will serve as both a giant gene resource and a valuable tool for map-based gene isolation, physical mapping and comparative genome analysis.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important foliar diseases of cereals. Infection by this pathogen on triticale has intensified in Poland in the last few years. In this study we examined resistance to powdery mildew in triticale hybrids possessing resistance genes Pm4b and Pm6 introduced from common wheat. The materials tested were hybrids derived from triticale crosses with common wheat cultivars carrying the desired resistance genes. The presence of the transferred genes was reflected in increased field resistance and shown by the use of molecular markers. The paper discusses the potential introduction of the genes to improve powdery mildew resistance.

AB Fifty-five populations of Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn., both ex situ conserved and in situ collected and originating from northern China, were analysed using 29 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers mapped on the wheat genome. The study showed ex situ and in situ populations had different numbers of alleles and allelic frequencies in 17 of the 29 primer pairs. The SSR markers revealed significant genetic differences between gene bank-conserved and in situ recollected populations from similar ecogeographical regions. AMOVA analysis indicated 15% of the total variation resided between groups, and 85% resided within groups. According to a dendrogram generated by unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distance matrix and principal coordinate analysis, recollected and gene bank-conserved populations from the same regions were distinguished. The results indicate that both in situ and ex situ conservation play complementary roles in the conservation of A. cristatum.

AB The nematodes are important biotic constraint in rain-fed wheat production systems. In Turkey, they is found in 75.0% of soil samples in Central Anatolia with the dominant species being Heterodera filipjevi. Yield losses for winter wheat in rain-fed environments are documented between 27.0-46.0 %. A single dominant gene for resistance to H. avenae, designated as Cre1, was assessed in Turkey. It was also found to be effective to Heterodera filipjevi. In this research, a STS-based Cre1 marker was applied in a number of segregating wheat populations from F(1) to F(4) to discriminate Cre1-positive lines among the wheat populations. Results clearly indicated that Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) is functioning effectively, with recovery of Cre1 positive lines up to 88.0 % depending on the cross in early stage of breeding.

AB Cereal species of the grass tribe Triticeae are economically important and provide staple food for large parts of the human population. The Fertile Crescent of Southwest Asia harbors high genetic and morphological diversity of these species. In this study, we analyzed genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among D genome-bearing species of the wheat relatives of the genus Aegilops from Iran and adjacent areas using allelic diversity at 25 nuclear microsatellite loci, nuclear rDNA ITS, and chloroplast trnL-F sequences. Our analyses revealed high microsatellite diversity in Aegilops tauschii and the D genomes of Triticum aestivum and Ae. ventricosa, low genetic diversity in Ae. cylindrica, two different Ae. tauschii gene pools, and a close relationship among Ae. crassa, Ae. juvenalis, and Ae. vavilovii. In the latter species group, cloned sequences revealed high diversity at the ITS region, while in most other polyploids, homogenization of the ITS region towards one parental type seems to have taken place. The chloroplast genealogy of the trnL-F haplotypes showed close relationships within the D genome Aegilops species and T. aestivum, the presence of shared haplotypes in up to three species, and up to three different haplotypes within single species, and indicates chloroplast capture from an unidentified species in Ae. markgrafii. The ITS phylogeny revealed Triticum as monophyletic and Aegilops as monophyletic when Amblyopyrum muticum is included.

ID RUST RESISTANCE GENE; STREAK-MOSAIC-VIRUS; MARKERS; REGION; SR2
AB 'Snowmass' (Reg. No. CV-1050, PI 658597) hard white winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed by the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station and released in July 2009 through a marketing agreement with the Colorado Wheat Research Foundation. In addition to researchers at Colorado State University (CSU) and Kansas State University (KSU), USDA-ARS researchers at Manhattan, KS, St. Paul, MN, and Pullman, WA, participated in its development. Snowmass was selected from the cross KS96HW94//'Trego'/CO960293 made in 1999 at Fort Collins, CO, with the initial F(1) between Trego and CO960293 made by KSU at Hays, KS. KS96HW94 is an unreleased experimental line from KSU with the pedigree 'Arlin' (PI 564246)/KS89H20. Trego is a hard white winter wheat cultivar released by KSU in 1999. CO960293 is an unreleased experimental line from CSU from which the germplasm release CO960293-2 was selected. Snowmass was selected as an F(6:7) line in July 2006 and assigned experimental line number CO03W054-2. Snowmass was released because of its superior grain yield under nonirrigated production conditions in eastern Colorado; its resistance to Wheat streak mosaic virus, stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici), and stem rust (P. graminis f. sp. tritici); and its superior milling and bread-baking quality.

AB Chloroplast transformation in wheat was achieved by bombardment of scutella from immature embryos and immature inflorescences, respectively. A wheat chloroplast site-specific expression vector, pBAGNRK, was constructed by placing an expression cassette containing neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) and green fluorescent protein (gfp) as selection and reporter genes, respectively, in the intergenic spacer between atpB and rbcL of wheat chloroplast genome. Integration of gfp gene in the plastome was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Southern blotting using gfp gene as a probe. Expression of GFP protein was examined by western blot. Three positive transformants were obtained and the Southern blot of partial fragment of atpB and rbcL (targeting site) probes verified that one of them was homoplasmic. Stable expression of GFP fluorescence was confirmed by confocal microscopy in the leaf tissues from T-1 progeny seedlings. PCR analysis of gfp gene also confirmed the inheritance of transgene in the T-1 progeny. These results strengthen the feasibility of wheat chloroplast transformation and also give a novel method for the introduction of important agronomic traits in wheat through chloroplast transformation.

AB The composition and quantity of high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS and LMW-GS) plays an important role in determining the end-use quality of wheat products. In the present study, 718 wheat cultivars and advanced lines from 20 countries were characterised for the HMW-GS and LMW-GS with allele-specific molecular markers. For the Glu-A1 locus, 311 cultivars (43.3%) had the subunit Ax2*, which predominated in cultivars from Canada (83.3%), Romania (91.7%), Russia (72.2%) and USA(72.2%). At Glu-B1 locus, 197 cultivars (27.4%) contained the By8 subunit and its frequency was higher in Japanese (60.0%) and Romanian (62.5%) genotypes than in those from other countries; 264 cultivars (36.8%) carried the By9 subunit, mostly existing in the cultivars from Austria (100.0%), Russia (72.2%), and Serbia (72.7%); the By16 subunit was present in 44 cultivars (6.1%), with a relatively high percentage in Chile (19.5%), whereas almost no cultivars from other countries had this subunit; the frequency of Bx7(OE) was 3.1%, and was found only in cultivars from Argentina (12.1%), Australia (4.1%), Canada (25.0%), Iran (20.0%), and Japan (30.0%). There were 446 genotypes (62.1%) with the subunit Dx5 at the Glu-D1 locus; high frequencies of Dx5 occurred in cultivars from Hungary (90.0%), Romania (95.8%), and Ukraine (92.3%). At the Glu-A3 locus, the frequencies of Glu-A3a, b, c, d, e, f and g were 2.9, 6.8, 53.2, 12.8, 7.7, 13.8, and 2.4%, respectively. Glu-A3a was detected only in the cultivars from Bulgaria (13.3%), China (12.2%), Germany (2.7%), Iran (6.7%), Mexico (14.3%), Turkey (4.7%), and USA (5.1%); the high frequencies of superior alleles Glu-A3b and d were found in cultivars from Australia (39.7%) and France (24.5%); Glu-A3c was widely distributed in cultivars from all the countries; the high frequencies of Glu-A3e, f and g were detected in cultivars from Argentina (33.3%), Canada (29.2%), and Hungary (20.0%). At the Glu-B3 locus, Glu-B3a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and i were present in frequencies of 0.4, 22.3, 0.3, 2.8, 1.9, 3.9, 27.2, 18.8, and 7.1%, respectively. Glu-B3a was detected only in cultivars from Argentina (3.0%) and Ukraine (15.4%) cultivars; high frequencies of Glu-B3b and d were found in the cultivars from Romania (62.5%) and Mexico (14.3%); Glu-B3c was detected only in Romanian (8.3%) genotypes; frequencies of e, f, h and i were high in cultivars from Austria (40.0%), China (14.3%), USA (43.0%), and Argentina (33.3%); Glu-B3g was mostly detected in the cultivars from Germany (69.3%), Norway (77.3%), and Serbia (63.6%). The frequency of the 1B-1R translocation was 13.4%; it occurred in cultivars from all the countries except Australia, Austria, Norway, and Serbia. The functional markers applied in this study, in agreement with the results of sodium-dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were accurate and stable, and can be used effectively in wheat quality breeding.

AB Early-season drought is an adverse environmental factor affecting seedling emergence and crop establishment in winter wheat grown in continental climates. The different semi-dwarfing (Rht, reduced height) genes exert various effects on seedling growth, plant height and productivity. The occurrence of the major Rht genes in 69 Bulgarian bread wheat cultivars was postulated by molecular markers. Cultivars carrying Rht-D1b+Rht8 (1), Rht-B1b/d (6), Rht-B1b/d+Rht8 (19), or Rht8 (43) were identified. The three latter groups were compared in respect to germination and seedling growth in response to polyethylene glycol-induced osmotic stress, plant height and main yield components. Cultivars carrying only Rht8 produced longer roots, coleoptiles and shoots, and had smaller root-to-shoot length ratio in non-stress and in osmotic stress conditions compared with those carrying Rht-B1b/d or Rht-B1b/d+Rht8. The same cultivars produced shorter culms, shorter spikes with fewer spikelets, reduced number and mass of grain in the main spike, and reduced 50-grain mass. The Rht genic effects were confirmed on Rht near-isogenic lines. The preferential semi-dwarfing allele selection aiming to combine the advantages of Rht8 and Rht-B1b/d alleles in specific eco-climatic conditions and to improve breeding efficiency in wheat is discussed.

ID WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; GERMPLASM RESISTANT; REGISTRATION; KANSAS
AB Wheat streak mosaic (WSM), caused by Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), is a devastating disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Great Plains of North America. Use of resistance is an effective and environmentally sound method to control the disease. In this study, six wheat genotypes were compared for their responses to WSMV infection under growth chamber conditions. The three resistant genotypes, KS96HW10-3 (Wsm1), Mace (Wsm1), and CO960293-2, had disease scores significantly lower than the remaining three genotypes without major resistance. Disease in TAM 111 and TAM 112 was consistently less severe than Karl 92. A population consisting of 188 F(2:3) families derived from the cross CO960293-2 x TAM 111 was used for determining inheritance of the WSMV resistance and for molecular mapping of the resistance in CO960293-2. Data on segregation of resistance indicated that the resistance in CO960293-2 is conditioned by a single dominant gene, which was named Wsm2. Transgressive segregation toward susceptibility occurred in the population suggesting a minor gene in the moderately susceptible parent TAM 111, which was not allelic to Wsm2. Wsm2 was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3B with two flanking simple sequence repeat markers. The single dominant gene inheritance for WSMV resistance in CO960293-2 has been consistent with the observations that the resistance can be readily transferred to adapted cultivars.

AB Understanding the genetic factors underlying agronomic traits in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is essential to making gains from selection during the breeding process. A set of 188 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a 'Louise' x 'Penawawa' mapping population was grown for two crop years at two locations in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with seedling growth habit, leaf color, plant height, flowering date, maturity date, grain volume weight, grain protein content, and grain yield. Quantitative trait loci for flowering date and maturity date were associated with the Ppd-D1 gene for photoperiod insensitivity. Variation in the QTL for plant height was dependent on location and year and localized to chromosome 2D and 3B. A QTL for leaf color was identified on chromosome 2B. Seedling growth habit mapped to chromosome 2D, and a significant QTL for grain volume weight was detected on chromosome 1B. Quantitative trait loci were identified for grain yield; however, some of these QTL were associated with other known QTL for pest resistance, seedling growth habit, or photoperiod insensitivity. Flowering date, maturity date, and plant height were significantly correlated, which resulted from the pleiotropic effects of the Ppd-D1 gene. The identification of agronomic QTL, and the correlations between and among them, is the first step toward making gains from selection using molecular marker-assisted selection for these important agronomic traits.

AB Wild Triticum and Aegilops species are increasingly used in wheat breeding programmes around the world as donors of genes conferring resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as of genes that contribute to the improvement of grain quality. In the present study, thirty-nine accessions of diploid species with the A genome (Triticum boeoticum and T. urartu) were evaluated for the presence of the genes conferring resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and leaf rust (Puccinia recondita) using both inoculation tests and sequence tagged sites (STS) marker analyses in order to find correspondence between STS markers and resistance as a trait. The most resistant entries were T. boeoticum accessions. All the marked Lr and Pm resistance genes (Pm1, Pm2, Pm3, Lr10, Lr47, Lr25 and Lr28) were identified in the check T. aestivum cultivar Bezostaya 1. The resistance to powdery mildew in the material studied was conferred by the combination of the Pm1 gene with either Pm2 or Pm3. The Pm1 and Pm3 markers appeared to be suitable for tracking these powdery mildew resistance genes, while the Pm2 gene marker cannot be considered as usable in various genetically different wheat accessions. The presence of the genes Lr25, Lr28 and Lr47 seems to be particularly useful for obtaining leaf rust resistance in T. boeoticum and T. urartu species.

AB Approximately 20 years ago, we began our efforts to understand grain yield in winter wheat using chromosome substitution lines between Cheyenne (CNN) and Wichita (WI). We found that two chromosome substitutions, 3A and 6A, greatly affected grain yield. CNN(WI3A) and CNN(WI6A) had 15 to 20% higher grain yield than CNN, whereas WI(CNN3A) and WI(CNN6A) had 15 to 20% lower grain yield than WI. The differences in grain yield are mainly expressed in higher yielding environments (e.g. eastern Nebraska) indicating genotype by environment interactions (G x E). In studies using hybrid wheat, the gene action for grain yield on these chromosomes was found to be mainly controlled by additive gene action. In subsequent studies, we developed recombinant inbred chromosome lines (RICLs) using monosomics or doubled haploids. In extensive studies we found that two regions on 3A affect grain yield in the CNN(RICLs-3A) with the positive QTL coming from WI. In WI(RICLs-3A), we found a main region on 3A that affected grain yield with the negative QTL coming from CNN. The 3A region identified using WI(RICLs-3A) coincided with one of the regions previously identified in CNN(RICLs-3A). As expected the QTLs have their greatest effect in higher-yielding environments and also exhibit QTL x E. Using molecular markers on chromosomes 3A and 6A, the favorable alleles on 3A in Wichita may be from Turkey Red, the original hard red winter wheat in the Great Plains and presumably the original source of the favorable alleles. Cheyenne, a selection from Crimea, did not have the favorable alleles. In studying modern cultivars, many high yielding cultivars adapted to eastern Nebraska have the WI-allele indicating that it was selected for in breeding higher yielding cultivars. However, some modern cultivars adapted to western Nebraska where the QTL has less effect retain the CNN-allele, presumably because the allele has less effect (is less important in improving grain yield). In addition many modern cultivars have neither the WI-allele, nor the CNN-allele indicating we have diversified our germplasm and new alleles have been brought into the breeding program in this region.

AB It is estimated that world-wide existing germplasm collections contain about 7.5 million accessions of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Wheat (Triticum and Aegilops) represents the biggest group comprising 900 000 accessions. However, such a huge number of accessions is hindering a successful exploitation of the germplasm. The creation of core collections representing a wide spectrum of the genetic variation of the whole assembly may help to overcome the problem. Here we demonstrate the successful utilisation of such a core collection for the identification and molecular mapping of genes (Quantitative Trait Loci) determining the agronomic traits flowering time and grain yield, exploiting a marker-trait-association based technique. Significant marker-trait associations were obtained and are presented. The intrachromosomal location of many of these associations coincided with those of already identified major genes or quantitative trait loci, but others were detected in regions where no known genes have been located to date.

AB Common bunt and dwarf bunt, caused by Tilletia caries (DC) Tul., T foetida (Wallr) Liro., and T controversa, respectively, can still cause yield and quality losses, despite the availability of effective chemical treatments. Growing resistant cultivars remains the best option for economical and environmental reasons, and is the only effective alternative in organic farming. As the durability of bunt resistance has proved to be rather poor, the pyramiding of resistance genes has been envisaged as a method of extending the life of resistance genes. Molecular markers can considerably increase the efficiency of gene pyramiding, but, because incomplete expression of both susceptibility and resistance genes makes accurate phenotyping difficult, very few markers associated with bunt resistance genes have been identified to date. This is why, at the National Agricultural Research & Development Institute Fundulea-Romania, along with the breeding program for bunt resistance, research on the possible use of molecular markers for Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) was developed. Random F, or F, lines from crosses between a Bt11 line or a bunt resistant line derived from a Triticale/2 x wheat, and susceptible parents, were phenotyped under artificial inoculation conditions, and were genotyped using primers for several markers. Preliminary results suggest that the Bt11 gene is located on chromosome 3B, and may be associated with marker loci Xbarc180, Xwmc623, Xwmc808 and Xgwm285. The gene for bunt resistance transferred from Triticale (line F00628G34-1 - possessing a 1A/1R translocation) can make MAS possible by using 1R specific markers. Although these results are preliminary, they already prove to be useful for the diversification and pyramiding of bunt resistance genes in breeding for durability of bunt resistance.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (asexual stage: Septoria tritici), is one of the most economically important diseases of wheat worldwide. During the past decade 13 genes for resistance to STB have been identified and several molecular markers have been developed. However, analysis of resistance gene expression and utility for plant improvement programs would be increased if the resistance genes were isolated in a common susceptible background. To address this problem, a program was begun to backcross resistance genes Stb1-8 into two susceptible wheat cultivars. Work with genes Stb2, Stb3, Stb6 and Stb8 has proceeded the farthest. Resistance gene Stb3 is dominant, while Stb2 may be recessive. This will be the first report of recessive resistance to STB if confirmed. Molecular markers linked to the resistance genes are being validated in the backcross progeny and should provide the materials for efficient introgression of these genes into elite germplasm for future wheat improvement.

AB In Central Asia, stem rust (Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici) causes considerable damage, especially during growing seasons with high rainfall. Ug99 is a race of stem rust that is virulent to the majority of wheat varieties. To develop disease-free germplasm, wheat material was screened using the predominant stem rust races of Kazakhstan and tested in two nurseries; CIMMYT-Turkey and the Plant Breeding Station at Njoro, Kenya. A total of 11 pathotypes of P graminis f.sp. tritici were identified in Kazakhstan from the stem rust samples collected in 2008-2009. In particular, pathotypes TDT/H, TPS/H, TTH/K, TKH/R, TKT/C and TFK/R were highly virulent. Of the 170 advanced lines of wheat, 21 CIMMYT lines resistant to 5 aggressive Kazakhstani pathotypes of P graminis were identified. A high level of resistance was observed in 11 wheat cultivars and advanced lines: Taza, E-19, E-99, E-102, E-572, E-796, E-809 (Kazakhstan), Ekinchi (Azerbaijan), Dostlik, Ulugbek 600 (Uzbekistan) and Umanka (Russia). Based on data obtained from Turkey-CIMMYT and the Plant Breeding Station Njoro, Kenya nurseries, out of 13 tested entries, 6 wheat breeding lines which were resistant to both stem and yellow rust and 10 wheat lines which showed high and moderate levels of resistance to Ug99 were selected. Using the sequence tagged site (STS) molecular marker Sr24#12, associated with Sr24/Lr24, seven wheat entries resistant to stem rust were identified. These results will assist breeders in choosing parents for crossing in programmes aimed at developing varieties with desirable levels of stem rust resistance in Kazakhstan and they will also facilitate stacking the resistance genes into advanced breeding lines.

AB A collection of introgression lines was obtained from crosses of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with tetraploid wheat Triticum timopheevii (Zhuk.). Evaluation of resistance to fungal diseases revealed the lines with resistance to leaf and stem rusts, powdery mildew, spot blotch, and loose smut, the most widespread in Siberian region of Russia. Localization of the T timopheevii genome fragments by means of microsatellite markers determined higher frequency of substitutions and translocations on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 23, 5A, 5B and 6B. Molecular mapping of the loci determining leaf rust resistance revealed two independent loci on chromosomes 5B and 2A. The major locus on 5BS.5BL-5GL translocated chromosome accounting 64% of the phenotypic variance of the trait was found to be closely linked to microsatellite markers Xgwm814 and Xgwm1257. The other, minor locus, controlling 11% of the trait was mapped next to Xgwm312 on chromosome 2A. Microsatellite markers located near these genes may be used for controlling the transfer of valuable traits in new wheat cultivars.

AB Rye has already proven to be a good donor of genes for improving important traits and diversity in wheat breeding. The agronomic advantages of wheat-rye translocations, as well as their detrimental pleiotropic effects, were shown to be dependent on the source of the transferred rye chromatin. This justifies continued effort for introgression of rye genes from various sources into various wheat backgrounds. There are still many genes of interest for wheat improvement, not yet transferred, that are available in the rye genome. This paper describes the strategy applied at the National Agricultural Research and Development Institute Fundulea (Romania), to take advantage of the existence of intensive breeding programs in both winter wheat and triticale, and presents some of the results obtained so far by applying this strategy, in obtaining lines with common bunt, barley yellow dwarf (BYDV) and other diseases resistances, as well as improved seedling vigour and crop spectral reflectance.

AB Advanced wheat lines carrying the Hessian fly resistance gene H27 were obtained by backcrossing the wheat/Aegilops ventricosa introgression line, H-93-33, to commercial wheat cultivars as recurrent parents. The Acph-N(v)1 marker linked to the gene H27 on the 4N(v) chromosome of this line was used for marker assisted selection. Advanced lines were evaluated for Hessian fly resistance in field and growth chamber tests, and for other agronomic traits during several crop seasons at different localities of Spain. The hessian fly resistance levels cif lines carrying the 4N(v) chromosome introgression (4D/4N(v) substitution and recombination lines that previously were classified by in situ hybridisation) were high, but always lower than that of their Ae. ventricosa progenitor. Introgression lines had higher grain yields in infested field trials than those without the 4N(v) chromosome and their susceptible parents, but lower grain yields under high yield potential conditions. The 4N(v) introgression was also associated with later heading, and lower tiller and grain numbers/m(2). In addition, it was associated with longer and more lax spikes, and higher values of grain weight and grain protein content. However, the glutenin and gliadin expression, as well as the bread-making performance, were similar to those of their recurrent parents.

AB A new wheat-Thinopyrum substitution line AS1677, developed from a cross between wheat line ML-13 and wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium ssp. trichophorum partial amphiploid TE-3, was characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), sequential Giemsa-C banding, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), seed storage protein electrophoresis, molecular marker analysis and disease resistance screening. Sequential Giemsa-C banding and GISH using Pseudoroegneria spicata genomic DNA as probe indicated that a pair of St-chromosomes with strong terminal bands were introduced into AS1677. FISH using pTa71 as a probe gave strong hybridization signals at the nuclear organization region and in the distal region of the short arms of the St chromosome. Moreover, FISH using the repetitive sequence pAs1 revealed that a pair of wheat 1D chromosomes was absent in accession AS1677. Seed storage proteins separated by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (APAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed that AS1677 lacked the gliadin and glutenin bands encoded by Gli-D1 and Glu-D1, further confirming the absence of chromosome 1D. The introduced St chromosome pair belonging to homoeologous group 1 was identified by newly produced genome specific markers. AS1677 is a new 1St (1D) substitution line. When inoculated with stripe rust and powdery mildew isolates, AS1677 expressed stripe rust resistance possibly derived from its Thinopyrum parent. AS1677 can be used as a donor source for introducing novel disease resistance genes to wheat in breeding programs aided by molecular and cytogenetic markers.

AB Eyespot is a major disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in temperate climates and causes yield losses of up to 40%. The causal agents of eyespot are Oculimacula acuformis (syn. Tapesia acuformis; anamorph: Helgardia acuformis syn. Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides var. acuformis) and O. yallundae (syn. T. yallundae; anamorph: H. yallundae syn. P. h. var. herpotrichoides). Pch1 located on chromosome 7DL is the most important and most effective resistance gene, but its use in practical breeding is limited because of difficulties in phenotyping and the fact that markers like XustSSR2001-7DL are often population-specific in German wheat cultivars. Therefore, based on results obtained for endopeptidase Ep-D1a, which is very closely linked to Pch1, molecular markers located in the terminal region of chromosome 7DL were analysed in three DH (double haploid) populations. In a next step these molecular markers were validated on a set of German winter wheat cultivars to obtain information on their usefulness for marker assisted selection (MAS). Based on the analysis of 127 DH-lines, linkage to Pch1 (Ep-D1) was obtained for Xorw1, Xorw5, Xorw6, Xcfd175, Xbarc76, Xwmc14, and Xcfa2040. Analyses of 104 German winter wheat cultivars showed that Xorw1, Xorw6 and the SSR Xcfd175 of these markers are well suited for MAS in German wheat breeding.

AB On smallholder farms in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains in Nepal, fungi of the Fusarium graminearum clade cause Gibberella ear rot of maize and contamination with the 8-ketotrichothecenes nivalenol and deoxynivalenol. Previous DNA marker analyses of the F. graminearum clade from maize in Nepal found a high level of genetic diversity but were limited in detail or scope. The present study incorporated a collection of 251 field strains from a wide geographic distribution in Nepal and utilized sequencing of the MAT1-1-3 gene of the mating type locus to determine the number and frequency of lineages and species of the F. graminearum clade. The frequency of nivalenol and deoxynivalenol chemotypes was determined by chemical analysis and by TRI13 deletion-marker analysis. We found that Gibberella ear rot of maize in Nepal is associated with a complex of species of the F. graminearum clade - mainly Fusarium asiaticum and Fusarium meridionale, but also Fusarium boothii and a putative new lineage, which we have designated the 'Nepal lineage'. Fusarium graminearum sensu strict, which dominates in maize elsewhere in Asia and worldwide, was not detected in Nepal. Although nivalenol production has been associated experimentally with lower virulence in maize ear rot and wheat head blight, this collection of the F. graminearum clade from maize in Nepal is dominated (4:1) by nivalenol producers, suggesting that traits other than crop plant pathogenesis affect population structure in this complex agroecosystem.

AB The limited number of papaya varieties available reflects the narrow genetic base of this species. The use of backcrossing as a breeding strategy can promote increases in variability, besides allowing targeted improvements. Procedures that combine the use of molecular markers and backcrossing permit a reduction of the time required for introgression of genes of interest and appropriate recovery of the recurrent genome. We used microsatellite markers to characterize the effect of first-generation backcrosses of three papaya progeny, by monitoring the level of homozygosity and the parental genomic ratio. The homozygosity level in the population ranged from 74 to 94%, with a mean of 85% for the three progenies (52-08, 52-29 and 52-34). The high level of inbreeding found among these genotypes increases the expectation of finding more than 95% fixed loci in the next generation of self-fertilization of superior genotypes. The mean proportion of the recurrent parent genome found in first-generation backcross progeny was 50.1%; 52-34 had a larger genomic region in common with the recurrent genitor and the lowest level of homozygosity. The progeny 52-08 was genetically closest to the donor genitor, and it also had the highest level of homozygosity. We found that linking conventional procedures and molecular markers contributed to an increase in the efficiency of the breeding program.

AB Resistance gene analog-expressed sequence tag (RGA-EST)-based markers have been used for variety discrimination and studies of genetic diversity in wheat. Our aim is to increase the competitiveness of public wheat breeding programs through intensive use of modern selection technologies, mainly marker-assisted selection. The genetic diversity of 77 wheat nucleotide binding site (NBS)-containing RGA-ESTs was assessed. Resistant and susceptible bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes were used as sources of DNA for PCR amplifications. In our previous studies, the F(2) individuals derived from the combinations PI178383 x Harmankaya99, Izgi2001 x ES14, and Sonmez2001 x Aytin98 were evaluated for yellow rust resistance at both seedling and adult stages to identify DNA markers. We have now examined the genetic variability among the resistant and susceptible Turkish wheat cultivars for yellow rust disease and the mean genetic distance between the cultivars. The highest similarity was 0.500 between Harmankaya99 and Sonmez2001. The lowest similarity was 0.286 between Aytin98, PI178383 and Aytin98, ES14. A relatively high level (49.5%) of polymorphism was observed with 77 RGA-EST primers across the six wheat genotypes, despite the fact that all of them were local cultivars from geographically close locations. RGA-EST sequences were compared by BlastX algorithms for amino acid sequences to determine the polymorphic categories among the combinations. BlastX analyses of six RGA-ESTs that gave polymorphic patterns for all combinations were NBS-LRR class RGA, NB-ARC domain containing protein, NBS-type resistance protein RGC5, NBS-LRR-S/TPK stem rust resistance protein, and putative MLA1 proteins, while 38 RGA-EST gave a monomorphic pattern.

AB Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and their flanking regions in chloroplast genomes (plastomes) of some species of the family Poaceae were analyzed in silico to look for DNA sequence variations. Comparison of the complete chloroplast DNA sequences (cpDNAs) of sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid cv. SP-80-3280 and S. officinarum cv. NCo310) and related species, Agrostis stolonifera, Brachypodium distachyon, Hordeum vulgare subsp vulgare, Lolium perenne, Oryza nivara, O. sativa subsp indica, O. sativa subsp japonica, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Zea mays, and Z. mays cv. B73, allowed us to examine the organization of chloroplast SSRs (cpSSRs) in genic and intergenic regions. We identified 204 cpSSRs in the sugarcane cpDNA; 22.5% were in genic regions. The ndh, rps, trn, and rpl gene clusters of the chloroplasts had the most repeats. Mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant cpSSRs in these species; however, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats were also identified. Many base substitutions and deletions/insertions were identified in the cpSSR loci and their flanking regions. Multiple alignments of all cpSSR sequences of Poaceae species made identification of nucleotide variability possible; repeat motifs are not uniformly distributed across the Poaceae plastomes, but are mostly confined to intergenic regions. Phylogeny was determined by maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining inference methods. The cpSSRs of these species were found to be polymorphic. It appears that individual cpSSRs in the Poaceae are stable, at least over short periods of evolutionary time. We conclude that the plastome database can be exploited for phylogenetic analysis and biotechnological development.

AB Near-isogenic lines (NILs) are useful for plant genetic and genomic studies. However, the strength of conclusions from such studies depends on the similarity of the NILs' genetic backgrounds. In this study, we investigated the genetic similarity for a set of NILs developed in the 1990s to study gene-for-gene interactions between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor (Say)), an important pest of wheat. Each of the eight NILs carries a single H resistance gene and was created by successive backcrossing for two to six generations to susceptible T. aestivum 'Newton'. We generated 256 target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) markers and used them to calculate genetic similarity, expressed by the Nei and Li (NL) coefficient. Six of the NILs (H3, H5, H6, H9, H11, and H13) had the highly uniform genetic background of Newton, with NL coefficients from 0.97 to 0.99. However, genotypes with H10 or H12 were less similar to Newton, with NL coefficients of 0.86 and 0.93, respectively. Cluster analysis based on NL coefficients and pedigree analysis showed that the genetic similarity between each of the NILs and Newton was affected by both the number of backcrosses and the genetic similarity between Newton and the H gene donors. We thus generated an equation to predict the number of required backcrosses, given varying similarity of donor and recurrent parent. We also investigated whether the genetic residues of the donor parents that remained in the NILs were related to linkage drag. By using a complete set of 'Chinese Spring' nullisomic-tetrasomic lines, one third of the TRAP markers that showed polymorphism between the NILs and Newton were assigned to a specific chromosome. All of the assigned markers were located on chromosomes other than the chromosome carrying the H gene, suggesting that the genetic residues detected in this study were not due to linkage drag. Results will aid in the development and use of near-isogenic lines for studies of the functional genomics of wheat.

AB Pests and diseases impact on crop yield and quality, and also reduce resource-use efficiency. Improved crop protection strategies to prevent such damage and loss can increase production and make a substantial contribution to food security. DNA-based technologies are likely to greatly increase the speed, sensitivity and accuracy of pest and pathogen detection and diagnosis. Rapid sequencing of nucleic acids from infected plants will aid identification of novel disease agents. Biomarkers of disease or crop damage such as volatile chemicals or blends may also be used to detect pest outbreaks. Biosensors coupled to information networks will provide real-time monitoring and surveillance of crops or stored produce and hence early warning of emerging problems and new invasive species. Challenges remain in the dissemination of new technologies and information to resource poor farmers in developing countries, although the rapid extension of the internet, mobile phones and other communication networks will provide new opportunities. Defining the genetic and molecular basis of innate plant immunity has been a major advance in plant biology with the potential to identify new targets for intervention via novel chemistry or genetic modification (GM). Identification of regulatory genes, signal molecules, pathways and networks controlling induced plant defence should lead to the development of a new generation of defence modulators, delivered either as crop protection products, or via biological agents on seeds or in the root zone. There should also be opportunities to select more responsive crop genotypes, or to develop transgenic crops tailored to respond to specific chemical cues or molecular patterns diagnostic for particular biotic threats. Sequencing of the genomes of the major crop species and their wild relatives will expand enormously the known gene pool and diversity of genetic resources available for plant breeders to access. It should be possible to identify genomic regions and genes conferring more durable, quantitative resistance to pathogens. The breeding cycle will be accelerated by high-throughput phenotyping and more efficient selection of resistance traits using within-gene markers. GM approaches will facilitate pyramiding (combining) resistance genes with different specificities and modes of action, thereby reducing the risk of directional selection for virulence. Analysis of the genomes of plant pathogens and invertebrate pests is already providing new information on genes, gene families and processes involved in host colonization and pathogenicity. Comparative genomics of species with diverse host ranges, contrasting feeding habits and different pathogenic lifestyles will identify new targets for inhibiting pest attack and aid the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and pesticides. Understanding the natural ecology of pests and pathogens, such as the factors determining host location, resource exploitation and interactions with other organisms, will improve our ability to manipulate behaviour, or exploit natural enemies or other antagonists of pest species. Volatile signals, either from natural plant sources, or engineered in transgenic crops, will be more widely used to modify pest behaviour. It may also be possible to manipulate microbial communities regulating pathogen populations and activity, and thereby recruit and retain more effective biocontrol agents.
   Insights into the natural diversity and activity of soil and microbial populations in the zones surrounding roots and seeds will provide new information on mechanism of suppression regulating pest species. Fully effective interventions are unlikely, due to the complexity and diversity of the soil system, but there should be progress towards integrated control regimes combining more resistant crop genotypes (either selected or GM) with targeted management of natural suppressive processes. Harnessing new technologies and knowledge to create more durable resistant crops and sustainable disease and pest management systems will require improved understanding of the factors driving pest and pathogen adaptation and evolution. There must also be an increased emphasis on translational research and delivery, and developing strategies appropriate for lower-input production systems, if the second 'green revolution' is to become a reality.

AB Positional cloning in bread wheat is a tedious task due to its huge genome size and hexaploid character. BAC libraries represent an essential tool for positional cloning. However, wheat BAC libraries comprise more than million clones, which makes their screening very laborious. Here, we present a targeted approach based on chromosome-specific BAC libraries. Such libraries were constructed from flow-sorted arms of wheat chromosome 7D. A library from the short arm (7DS) consisting of 49,152 clones with 113 kb insert size represented 12.1 arm equivalents whereas a library from the long arm (7DL) comprised 50,304 clones of 116 kb providing 14.9x arm coverage. The 7DS library was PCR screened with markers linked to Russian wheat aphid resistance gene DnCI2401, the 7DL library was screened by hybridization with a probe linked to greenbug resistance gene Gb3. The small number of clones combined with high coverage made the screening highly efficient and cost effective.

AB Efficiency of plant transformation is less than optimal for many important species, especially for monocots which are traditionally recalcitrant to transformation, such as wheat. And due to limited number of selectable marker genes, identification or selection of those cells that have integrated DNA into appropriate plant genome and to regenerate fully developed plants from the transformed cells, becomes even more difficult. Some of the widely used marker genes belong to the categories of herbicide or antibiotic resistance genes and flourescent protein genes. As they become an integral part of plant genome along with promoters prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin, there are certain health and environmental concerns about the use of these reporter genes. These marker genes are also inefficient with respect to time and space. In this study we have found a novel visible selection agent AtMYB12, to screen transgenic wheat, with in days after transformation. Transformed coleoptiles as well as cells regenerating from transformed cultured scutella, phenotypically exhibit purple pigmentation, making selection possible in limited and reasonable cost, time and space.

AB Fermentation of dietary fiber by the microflora enhances the levels of effective metabolites, which are potentially protective against colon cancer. The specific addition of probiotics may enhance the efficiency of fermentation of wheat aleurone, a source of dietary fiber. We investigated the effects of aleurone, fermented with fecal slurries with the addition of the probiotics LGG and Bb12 (aleurone(+)), on cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation, as well as expression of genes related to growth and apoptosis using two different human colon cell lines (HT29: adenocarcinoma cells; LT97: adenoma cells). The efficiency of fermentation of aleurone was only slightly enhanced by the addition of LGG/Bb12, resulting in an increased concentration of butyrate. In LT97 cells, the growth inhibition of aleurone(+) was stronger than in HT29 cells. In HT29 cells, a cell cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1) and the alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of differentiation, were enhanced by the fs aleurone(+). Treatment with all fermentation supernatants resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis and an upregulation of genes involved in cell growth and apoptosis (p21 and WNT2B). In conclusion, fs aleurone(+) modulated markers of cancer prevention, namely inhibition of cell growth and promotion of apoptosis as well as differentiation.

AB P>The pathogen Stagonospora nodorum produces multiple effectors, also known as host-selective toxins (HSTs), that interact with corresponding host sensitivity genes in an inverse gene-for-gene manner to cause the disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) in wheat. In this study, a sensitivity gene was identified in Aegilops tauschii, the diploid D-genome donor of common wheat. The gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5D and mediated recognition of the effector SnTox3, which was previously shown to be recognized by the wheat gene Snn3 on chromosome arm 5BS. Comparative mapping suggested that Snn3 and the gene on 5DS are probably homoeologous and derived from a common ancestor. Therefore, we propose to designate these genes as Snn3-B1 and Snn3-D1, respectively. Compatible Snn3-D1-SnTox3 interactions resulted in more severe necrosis in both effector infiltration and spore inoculation experiments than compatible Snn3-B1-SnTox3 interactions, indicating that Snn3-B1 and Snn3-D1 may have different affinities in SnTox3 recognition or signal transduction. Wheat bin-mapped expressed sequence tags and good levels of collinearity among the wheat Snn3 regions, rice (Oryza sativa), and Brachypodium distachyon were exploited for saturation and fine mapping of the Snn3-D1 locus. Markers delineating the Snn3-D1 locus to a 1.4 cM interval will be useful for initiating positional cloning. Further characterization of how these homoeologous genes mediate recognition of the same pathogen effector should enhance understanding of host manipulation by necrotrophic pathogens in causing disease.

AB Stem rust resistance gene Sr22 transferred to common wheat from Triticum boeoticum and T. monococcum remains effective against commercially prevalent pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, including Ug99 and its derivatives. Sr22 was previously located on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Several backcross derivatives (hexaploid) possessing variable sized Sr22-carrying segments were used in this study to identify a closely linked DNA marker. Expressed sequenced tags belonging to the deletion bin 7AL-0.74-0.86, corresponding to the genomic location of Sr22 were screened for polymorphism. In addition, RFLP markers that mapped to this region were targeted. Initial screening was performed on the resistant and susceptible DNA bulks obtained from backcross derivatives carrying Sr22 in three genetic backgrounds with short T. boeoticum segments. A cloned wheat genomic fragment, csIH81, that detected RFLPs between the resistant and susceptible bulks, was converted into a sequence tagged site (STS) marker, named cssu22. Validation was performed on Sr22 carrying backcross-derivatives in fourteen genetic backgrounds and other genotypes used for marker development. Marker cssu22 distinguished all backcross-derivatives from their respective recurrent parents and co-segregated with Sr22 in a Schomburgk (+Sr22)/Yarralinka (-Sr22)-derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Sr22 was also validated in a second population, Sr22TB/Lakin-derived F(4) selected families, containing shortened introgressed segments that showed recombination with previously reported flanking microsatellite markers.

AB Eyespot is an economically important fungal disease of wheat and other cereals caused by two fungal species: Oculimacula yallundae and Oculimacula acuformis. However, only two eyespot resistance genes have been characterised and molecular markers made available to plant breeders. These resistances are Pch1, introduced into wheat from the relative Aegilops ventricosa, and Pch2, originally identified in the cultivar Cappelle Desprez (CD). There are drawbacks associated with both resistances; Pch1 is linked to deleterious traits carried on the Ae. ventricosa introgression and Pch2 has been shown to have limited effectiveness. An additional resistance has been reported on chromosome 5A of CD that confers resistance to eyespot in adult plants. In the present study, we demonstrate that resistance on this chromosome is effective against both O. yallundae and O. acuformis eyespot pathogens and confers resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages. This resistance was mapped in both seedling bioassays and field trials in a 5A recombinant population derived from a cross between CD and a CD single chromosome substitution line carrying 5A from the susceptible line Bezostaya. The resistance was also mapped using seedling bioassays in a 5A recombinant population derived from a cross between the susceptible line Chinese Spring (CS) and a single chromosome substitution line carrying 5A from CD. A single major QTL on the long arm of chromosome 5A was detected in all experiments. Furthermore, the SSR marker Xgwm639 was found to be closely associated with the resistance and could be used for marker-assisted selection of the eyespot resistance by plant breeders.

AB Stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.) has re-emerged as a threat to wheat production with the evolution of new pathogen races, namely TTKSK (Ug99) and its variants, in Africa. Deployment of resistant wheat cultivars has provided long-term control of stem rust. Identification of new resistance genes will contribute to future cultivars with broad resistance to stem rust. The related Canadian cultivars Peace and AC Cadillac show resistance to Ug99 at the seedling stage and in the field. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the inheritance and genetically map resistance to Ug99 in these two cultivars. Two populations were produced, an F(2:3) population from LMPG/AC Cadillac and a doubled haploid (DH) population from RL6071/Peace. Both populations showed segregation at the seedling stage for a single stem rust resistance (Sr) gene, temporarily named SrCad. SrCad was mapped to chromosome 6DS in both populations with microsatellite markers and a marker (FSD_RSA) that is tightly linked to the common bunt resistance gene Bt10. FSD_RSA was the closest marker to SrCad (a parts per thousand 1.6 cM). Evaluation of the RL6071/Peace DH population and a second DH population, AC Karma/87E03-S2B1, in Kenya showed that the combination of SrCad and leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 provided a high level of resistance to Ug99-type races in the field, whereas in the absence of Lr34 SrCad conferred moderate resistance. A survey confirmed that SrCad is the basis for all of the seedling resistance to Ug99 in Canadian wheat cultivars. While further study is needed to determine the relationship between SrCad and other Sr genes on chromosome 6DS, SrCad represents a valuable genetic resource for producing stem rust resistant wheat cultivars.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective approach to control the disease, but only a few genes confer effective all-stage resistance against the current populations of the pathogen worldwide. It is urgent to identify new genes for diversifying sources of resistance genes and for pyramiding genes for different types of resistance in order to achieve high levels of durable resistance for sustainable control of stripe rust. The common spring wheat genotype 'PI 181434', originally from Afghanistan, was resistant in all greenhouse and field tests in our previous studies. To identify the resistance gene(s) PI 181434 was crossed with susceptible genotype 'Avocet Susceptible'. Adult plants of 103 F(2) progeny were tested in the field under the natural infection of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. Seedlings of the parents, F(2) and F(3) were tested with races PST-100 and PST-127 of the pathogen under controlled greenhouse conditions. The genetic study showed that PI 181434 has a single dominant gene conferring all-stage resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the gene. A linkage map of 8 RGAP and 2 SSR markers was constructed for the gene using data from the 103 F(2) plants and their derived F(3) lines tested in the greenhouse. Amplification of the complete set of nulli-tetrasomic lines and selected ditelosomic lines of Chinese Spring with an RGAP marker and the two SSR markers mapped the gene on the long arm of chromosome 3D. Because it is the first gene for stripe rust resistance mapped on chromosome 3DL and different from all previously named Yr genes, the gene in PI 181434 was designated Yr45. Polymorphism rates of the two closest flanking markers, Xwgp115 and Xwgp118, in 45 wheat genotypes were 73.3 and 82.2%, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the eight wheat genotypes sharing both flanking markers. The RGAP markers and potential SNP markers should be useful in incorporating the gene into wheat cultivars and in pyramiding it with other genes for durable resistance.

AB The OsGW2 gene is involved in rice grain development, influencing grain width and weight. Its ortholog in wheat, TaGW2, was considered as a candidate gene related to grain development. We found that TaGW2 is constitutively expressed, with three orthologs expressing simultaneously. The coding sequence (CDS) of TaGW2 is 1,275 bp encoding a protein with 424 amino acids, and has a functional domain shared with OsGW2. No divergence was detected within the CDS sequences in the same locus in ten varieties. Genome-specific primers were designed based on the sequence divergence of the promoter regions in the three orthologous genes, and TaGW2 was located in homologous group 6 chromosomes through CS nulli-tetrasomic (NT). Two SNPs were detected in the promoter region of TaGW2-6A, forming two haplotypes: Hap-6A-A (-593A and -739G) and Hap-6A-G (-593G and -769A). A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was developed based on the -593 A-G polymorphism to distinguish the two haplotypes in TaGW2-6A. This gene was fine mapped 0.6 cM from marker cfd80.2 near the centromere in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Two hundred sixty-five Chinese wheat varieties were genotyped and association analysis revealed that Hap-6A-A was significantly associated with wider grains and higher one-thousand grain weight (TGW) in two crop seasons. qRT-PCR revealed a negative relationship between TaGW2 expression level and grain width. The Hap-6A-A frequencies in Chinese varieties released at different periods showed that it had been strongly positively selected in breeding. In landraces, Hap-6A-A is mainly distributed in southern Chinese wheat regions. Association analysis also indicated that Hap-6A-A not only increased TGW by more than 3 g, but also had earlier heading and maturity. In contrast to Chinese varieties, Hap-6A-G was the predominant haplotype in European varieties; Hap-6A-A was mainly present in varieties released in the former Yugoslavia, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary and Portugal.

AB The common wheat genotype 'RL6077' was believed to carry the gene Lr34/Yr18 that confers slow-rusting adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and stripe rust but located to a different chromosome through inter-chromosomal reciprocal translocation. However, haplotyping using the cloned Lr34/Yr18 diagnostic marker and the complete sequencing of the gene indicated Lr34/Yr18 is absent in RL6077. We crossed RL6077 with the susceptible parent 'Avocet' and developed F(3), F(4) and F(6) populations from photoperiod-insensitive F(3) lines that were segregating for resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust. The populations were characterized for leaf rust resistance at two Mexican sites, Cd. Obregon during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 crop seasons, and El Batan during 2009, and for stripe rust resistance at Toluca, a third Mexican site, during 2009. The F(3) population was also evaluated for stripe rust resistance at Cobbitty, Australia, during 2009. Most lines had correlated responses to leaf rust and stripe rust, indicating that either the same gene, or closely linked genes, confers resistance to both diseases. Molecular mapping using microsatellites led to the identification of five markers (Xgwm165, Xgwm192, Xcfd71, Xbarc98 and Xcfd23) on chromosome 4DL that are associated with this gene(s), with the closest markers being located at 0.4 cM. In a parallel study in Canada using a Thatcher x RL6077 F(3) population, the same leaf rust resistance gene was designated as Lr67 and mapped to the same chromosomal region. The pleiotropic, or closely linked, gene derived from RL6077 that conferred stripe rust resistance in this study was designated as Yr46. The slow-rusting gene(s) Lr67/Yr46 can be utilized in combination with other slow-rusting genes to develop high levels of durable APR to leaf rust and stripe rust in wheat.

AB Background: Because of its size, allohexaploid nature and high repeat content, the wheat genome has always been perceived as too complex for efficient molecular studies. We recently constructed the first physical map of a wheat chromosome (3B). However gene mapping is still laborious in wheat because of high redundancy between the three homoeologous genomes. In contrast, in the closely related diploid species, barley, numerous gene-based markers have been developed. This study aims at combining the unique genomic resources developed in wheat and barley to decipher the organisation of gene space on wheat chromosome 3B.
   Results: Three dimensional pools of the minimal tiling path of wheat chromosome 3B physical map were hybridised to a barley Agilent 15K expression microarray. This led to the fine mapping of 738 barley orthologous genes on wheat chromosome 3B. In addition, comparative analyses revealed that 68% of the genes identified were syntenic between the wheat chromosome 3B and barley chromosome 3 H and 59% between wheat chromosome 3B and rice chromosome 1, together with some wheat-specific rearrangements. Finally, it indicated an increasing gradient of gene density from the centromere to the telomeres positively correlated with the number of genes clustered in islands on wheat chromosome 3B.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that novel structural genomics resources now available in wheat and barley can be combined efficiently to overcome specific problems of genetic anchoring of physical contigs in wheat and to perform high-resolution comparative analyses with rice for deciphering the organisation of the wheat gene space.

AB Background: The castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), a monotypic species in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae, 2n = 20), is an important non-edible oilseed crop widely cultivated in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate countries for its high economic value. Because of the high level of ricinoleic acid (over 85%) in its seed oil, the castor bean seed derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants, nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and biodiesel. Due to lack of efficient molecular markers, little is known about the population genetic diversity and the genetic relationships among castor bean germplasm. Efficient and robust molecular markers are increasingly needed for breeding and improving varieties in castor bean. The advent of modern genomics has produced large amounts of publicly available DNA sequence data. In particular, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide valuable resources to develop gene-associated SSR markers.
   Results: In total, 18,928 publicly available non-redundant castor bean EST sequences, representing approximately 17.03 Mb, were evaluated and 7732 SSR sites in 5,122 ESTs were identified by data mining. Castor bean exhibited considerably high frequency of EST-SSRs. We developed and characterized 118 polymorphic EST-SSR markers from 379 primer pairs flanking repeats by screening 24 castor bean samples collected from different countries. A total of 350 alleles were identified from 118 polymorphic SSR loci, ranging from 2-6 per locus (A) with an average of 2.97. The EST-SSR markers developed displayed moderate gene diversity (H(e)) with an average of 0.41. Genetic relationships among 24 germplasms were investigated using the genotypes of 350 alleles, showing geographic pattern of genotypes across genetic diversity centers of castor bean.
   Conclusion: Castor bean EST sequences exhibited considerably high frequency of SSR sites, and were rich resources for developing EST-SSR markers. These EST-SSR markers would be particularly useful for both genetic mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of castor bean.

TI Genome-wide SNPs and re-sequencing of growth habit and inflorescence
   genes in barley: implications for association mapping in germplasm
   arrays varying in size and structure
SO BMC GENOMICS

AB Background: Considerations in applying association mapping (AM) to plant breeding are population structure and size: not accounting for structure and/or using small populations can lead to elevated false-positive rates. The principal determinants of population structure in cultivated barley are growth habit and inflorescence type. Both are under complex genetic control: growth habit is controlled by the epistatic interactions of several genes. For inflorescence type, multiple loss-of-function alleles in one gene lead to the same phenotype. We used these two traits as models for assessing the effectiveness of AM. This research was initiated using the CAP Core germplasm array (n = 102) assembled at the start of the Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP). This array was genotyped with 4,608 SNPs and we re-sequenced genes involved in morphology, growth and development. Larger arrays of breeding germplasm were subsequently genotyped and phenotyped under the auspices of the CAP project. This provided sets of 247 accessions phenotyped for growth habit and 2,473 accessions phenotyped for inflorescence type. Each of the larger populations was genotyped with 3,072 SNPs derived from the original set of 4,608.
   Results: Significant associations with SNPs located in the vicinity of the loci involved in growth habit and inflorescence type were found in the CAP Core. Differentiation of true and spurious associations was not possible without a priori knowledge of the candidate genes, based on re-sequencing. The re-sequencing data were used to define allele types of the determinant genes based on functional polymorphisms. In a second round of association mapping, these synthetic markers based on allele types gave the most significant associations. When the synthetic markers were used as anchor points for analysis of interactions, we detected other known-function genes and candidate loci involved in the control of growth habit and inflorescence type. We then conducted association analyses - with SNP data only - in the larger germplasm arrays. For both vernalization sensitivity and inflorescence type, the most significant associations in the larger data sets were found with SNPs coincident with the synthetic markers used in the CAP Core and with SNPs detected via interaction analysis in the CAP Core.
   Conclusions: Small and highly structured collections of germplasm, such as the CAP Core, are cost-effectively phenotyped and genotyped with high-throughput markers. They are also useful for characterizing allelic diversity at loci in germplasm of interest. Our results suggest that discovery-oriented exercises in AM in such small arrays may generate a large number of false-positives. However, if haplotypes in candidate genes are available, they may be used as anchors in an analysis of interactions to identify other candidate regions harboring genes determining target traits. Using larger germplasm arrays, genome regions where the principal genes determining vernalization sensitivity and row type are located were identified.

AB Early diagnosis and control of different Fusarium species is essential for successful management of plant disease and subsequent prevention of toxins entering the food chain. This issue can be addressed using phylogenetic analyses and other molecular techniques, including the design of species-specific primers and corresponding PCR assays. In practice, only a few genes are sequenced for most species and insights into the evolutionary mechanisms at the species level usually stem from phylogenetic analyses of only one or a small number of genetic loci. This poses the question of whether the recovered tree accurately reflects the relationships among species or rather more local interrelationships particular to the genetic marker employed. This study examined if the Fusarium-specific CYP51C gene can be used to establish evolutionary relationships between Fusarium species and enable species-specific detection. The resolving power of the CYP51C gene was studied for 46 Fusarium isolates representing 18 different species. The resulting phylogeny analysis showed clear and well-structured separation of the isolates according to their species rank, synthesised toxin and Fusarium section. Moreover, a comparison between the individual CYP51C phylogeny and a reference tree (inferred from the concatenation of ITS, CYP51C, beta-tubulin and TEF-1 alpha sequences) indicated superior resolution of CYP51C relative to ITS and beta-tubulin sequences. In addition to its suitability as a reliable marker for diagnosis of different toxigenic Fusarium species, we also show that the CYP51C gene is a promising target for development of species-specific PCR. This was demonstrated by the specific detection of Fusarium cerealis in grain samples of wheat. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A genome-wide assessment of nucleotide diversity in a polyploid species must minimize the inclusion of homoeologous sequences into diversity estimates and reliably allocate individual haplotypes into their respective genomes. The same requirements complicate the development and deployment of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in polyploid species. We report here a strategy that satisfies these requirements and deploy it in the sequencing of genes in cultivated hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) and wild tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, genomes AABB) from the putative site of wheat domestication in Turkey. Data are used to assess the distribution of diversity among and within wheat genomes and to develop a panel of SNP markers for polyploid wheat.
   Results: Nucleotide diversity was estimated in 2114 wheat genes and was similar between the A and B genomes and reduced in the D genome. Within a genome, diversity was diminished on some chromosomes. Low diversity was always accompanied by an excess of rare alleles. A total of 5,471 SNPs was discovered in 1791 wheat genes. Totals of 1,271, 1,218, and 2,203 SNPs were discovered in 488, 463, and 641 genes of wheat putative diploid ancestors, T. urartu, Aegilops speltoides, and Ae. tauschii, respectively. A public database containing genome-specific primers, SNPs, and other information was constructed. A total of 987 genes with nucleotide diversity estimated in one or more of the wheat genomes was placed on an Ae. tauschii genetic map, and the map was superimposed on wheat deletion-bin maps. The agreement between the maps was assessed.
   Conclusions: In a young polyploid, exemplified by T. aestivum, ancestral species are the primary source of genetic diversity. Low effective recombination due to self-pollination and a genetic mechanism precluding homoeologous chromosome pairing during polyploid meiosis can lead to the loss of diversity from large chromosomal regions. The net effect of these factors in T. aestivum is large variation in diversity among genomes and chromosomes, which impacts the development of SNP markers and their practical utility. Accumulation of new mutations in older polyploid species, such as wild emmer, results in increased diversity and its more uniform distribution across the genome.

The conformity between molecular-genetic and storage protein electrophoretic data was revealed: the GliA1.2 allele corresponds to the Gli-A1o and Gli-A1m allelic variants of gliadin blocks; the GliA1.1 PCR allele corresponds to the Gli-A1f, Gli-A1b and Gli-A1c variants of gliadin blocks; the GliB1.1 allele corresponds to the Gli-B1b and Gli-B1d allelic variants; and the GliB1.2 allele corresponds to the Gli-B1e, Gli-B1g and Gli-B1c variants. A new PCR allele with primers for marker GliB1.1 at the Gli-B1 locus in the GLI-B1-12 line (with the gliadin Gli-Blo block), which was generated from crossing of Bezosta 1 and the variety Levent, was detected.

AB The genetic structure of Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici isolates sampled in three different regions of Ethiopia in 2006 and 2007 was investigated using 20 SSRs assuming sexual as well as asexual reproduction. Assays showed a high level of genetic diversity within P. graminis f.sp. tritici populations in Ethiopia in both modes of reproductions. Tests for population subdivision revealed the absence of genetic differentiation among the populations based on geographical separation as reflected by a low coefficient of genetic differentiation (<= 0.046) and a single cluster consisting of all isolates. Gene flow among populations was estimated to be high (10 per generation). This study shows that the pathogen population of Ethiopia is characterized by a high genetic diversity within each population and absence of segregation among populations. Information obtained from this study may serve as a basis to develop better strategies for deployment of resistance genes, e. g. using marker-assisted combination of resistance alleles to achieve better control of wheat stem rust in Ethiopia.

AB The bulk of large plant genomes consists of retrotransposons. Retrotransposons are able to integrate into a multitude of loci in the genome, and can thereby generate insertional polymorphism between individuals, as well as mutations and new characteristics. Retrotransposons are largely quiescent during development, but become more active in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, which cause them to produce larger pools of transcripts. The present study assesses the structural dynamics and putative transcriptional activation of BARE-1 and WIS 2-1A retrotransposons in ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced hexaploid wheat and Triticale sphaerococcum mutants, via an RT-PCR approach that utilized the retrotransposon based markers SSAP, IRAP and REMAP. Our results demonstrate a polymorphic pattern distribution of BARE-1/WIS 2-1A members, and identify new insertions. The WIS 2-1A retrotransposon members have a modulated transcriptional profile, which strongly suggests that EMS treatment encourages their activation Retrotransposon-based methods are efficient for fingerprinting and genetic polymorphism studies of sphaerococcum mutant forms, and can illuminate the genome dynamics affecting the genes responsible for the sphaerococcum phenotype.

AB Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping was carried out in a set of 114 lines of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) mapping population for null nitrogen fertilization during two agricultural cycles. We quantified phenologic parameters (days to: ear emergency time, flowering time) and components of yield (number of plants and ears, plant height, leaf area, length and weight of ear, spikelet number, number and total weight of grains and by third in the ear, weight of thousand grains and total yield). Interval mapping resulted of 138 QTLs, of which 47 were catalogued as major QTLs (LOD >= 3.0) and 91 as minor QTLs (LOD 2.0 <= 2.9). The QTLs were distributed in 14 of the 21 chromosomes of wheat. The data showed that a high percentage of QTLs were in chromosomes 2D (49 or 35.5%), followed by 5A (22 or 15.9%), 1B (10 or 7.2%).

AB In this study, a PCR method based on oligonucleotide primers targeting the Alt a 1 gene has been developed for the rapid detection of DNA from Alternaria spp. and for identification of Alternaria alternata, Alternaria porri, Alternaria radicina, and Alternaria infectoria species-groups in raw materials and processed food products. The assay design consists of two steps. First, a duplex PCR using primers Dir5cAlta1-Inv4Alta1 (that amplifies a specific DNA fragment of approximately 195 bp in all Alternaria spp.) and 18Sfweu-18Srveu (that amplifies a conserved 99 bp fragment on all the eukaryotic species), allows detection of Alternaria spp. DNA in foodstuffs with a high sensitivity and specificity. As a second step, identification of Alternaria species-groups is obtained through a seminested PCR method, without the need for sequencing PCR products. The specificity of the primer pairs designed was verified by PCR analysis of DNA from various Alternaria cultures, and also from several non target species. The detection limit of the method was approximately 10(2) CFU/ml, either in viable culture, heat inactivated culture or inoculated tomato pulp. Nevertheless, a sensitivity of 10(3) CFU/ml was obtained for tomato pulp inoculated with A. alternata or A. porri cultures heat inactivated at 90 degrees C for 5 min. PCR analysis of commercial foodstuff samples demonstrated the presence of DNA from A. alternata species-group in 100% of spoiled tomato samples, and 8% of tomato products, whilst 36.4% of cereal based infant food samples analyzed contained DNA from A. infectoria species-group.

AB Wheat quality, a complex term, depends upon intentional use for unambiguous products. The foremost determinants of wheat quality are endosperm texture (grain hardness), protein content and gluten strength. Endosperm texture in wheat is the single most important and defining quality characteristic, as it facilitates wheat classification and affects milling, baking and end-use quality. Various techniques used for grain hardness measurement are classified into diverse groups according to grinding, crushing and abrasion. The most extensively used methods for texture measurement are PSI, NIR hardness, SKCS, pearling index, SDS-PAGE and PCR markers. Friabilin is a 15 kDa endosperm specific protein associated with starch granules of wheat grain and is unswervingly related to grain softness. Chemically, it is a concoction of different polypeptides, primarily puroindolines; Pin a and Pin b. Hardness (Ha) locus of chromosome 5DS makes the distinction between soft and hard classes of wheat. Some additional modifying genes are also present which contribute to the disparity within wheat classes. Numerous allelic mutations in Pin have been reported and their relation to end product quality has been established. This treatise elaborates the consequence of grain hardness in wheat eminence.

AB Physical maps of chromosomes provide a framework for organizing and integrating diverse genetic information. DNA microarrays are a valuable technique for physical mapping and can also be used to facilitate the discovery of single feature polymorphisms (SFPs). Wheat chromosome arm 2BL was physically mapped using a Wheat Genome Array onto near-isogenic lines (NILs) with the aid of wheat-rice synteny and mapped wheat EST information. Using high variance probe set (HVP) analysis, 314 HVPs constituting genes present on 2BL were identified. The 314 HVPs were grouped into 3 categories: HVPs that match only rice chromosome 4 (298 HVPs), those that match only wheat ESTs mapped on 2BL (1), and those that match both rice chromosome 4 and wheat ESTs mapped on 2BL (15). All HVPs were converted into gene sets, which represented either unique rice gene models or mapped wheat ESTs that matched identified HVPs. Comparative physical maps were constructed for 16 wheat gene sets and 271 rice gene sets. Of the 271 rice gene sets, 257 were mapped to the 18-35 Mb regions on rice chromosome 4. Based on HVP analysis and sequence similarity between the gene models in the rice chromosomes and mapped wheat ESTs, the outermost rice gene model that limits the translocation breakpoint to orthologous regions was identified.

AB Wild Thinopyrum grasses are important gene pools for forage and cereal crops. Knowledge of their chromosome organizations is pivotal for efficient utilization of this important gene pool in germplasm enhancement programs. Expressed sequence tags derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers for Thinopyrum bessarabicum, T. elongatum, and T. junceum chromosomes were identified among amplicons produced from three series of wheat-Thinopyrum addition lines using 193 primer pairs designed from the Leymus EST unigenes. The homology of T. junceum chromosomes in 13 wheat addition lines was tentatively established to reveal that homologous groups 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were represented by HD3515, HD3505, AJDAj11, AJDAj1, and HD3508, whereas groups 1 and 2 were represented by AJADj7-AJDAj9 and AJDAj2-AJDAj4, respectively. AJDAj5 and AJDAj6 had complexly reconstituted T. junceum chromosomes that might have resulted from fusion or translocations of large chromosomal segments from two or more chromosomes, that is (1+5) and (2+5+1), respectively. The identified EST-SSR markers will be useful in comparative gene mapping, chromosome tracing, taxonomic studies, gene introgression, and cultivar identification.

AB The orderly development of winter wheat through its life cycle can be marked at three stages: stem elongation, heading date, and physiological maturity. The duration of a developmental phase between two stages is important in yield component generation. In this study the three developmental stages were characterized and 350 markers were mapped in a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from a cross between two winter wheat cultivars ('Jagger' and '2174'). Three major QTLs were found to control variation in developmental process, and each of them was tightly associated with a known flowering gene, VRN-A1 on chromosome 5A, PPD-D1 on chromosome 2D, and VRN-D3 on chromosome 7D. The average contribution of the gene marker for each QTL to the total phenotypic variation (R (2)) was evaluated over 3 years. The effect of VRN-A1 ranged from 21.5% at stem elongation to 17.4% at physiological maturity. The effect of PPD-D1 was minor (6.7%) at stem elongation but increased to 29.7% at heading and 20.1% at physiological maturity. The effect of VRN-D3 was not detected at stem elongation but increased to 14.6% at heading and to 20.5% at physiological maturity. Hence, the VRN-A1 locus, the PPD-D1 locus, and the VRN-D3 locus had greatest impact on development at stem elongation, heading date, and physiological maturity, respectively. Whereas the Jagger VRN-A1 and VRN-D3 alleles accelerated development, the Jagger PPD-D1 allele delayed the developmental process due to its sensitivity to photoperiod. Our findings suggest that through the appropriate combination of alleles at these three loci one would be able to regulate the various developmental phases to accommodate different agricultural needs.

AB Stem rust is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. The recent emergence of wheat stem rust race Ug99 (TTKS based on the North American stem rust race nomenclature system) and related strains threaten global wheat production because they overcome widely used genes that had been effective for many years. Host resistance is likely to be more durable when several stem rust resistance genes are pyramided in a single wheat variety; however, little is known about the resistance genotypes of widely used wheat germplasm. In this study, a diverse collection of wheat germplasm was haplotyped for stem rust resistance genes Sr2, Sr22, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr36, Sr40, and 1A.1R using linked microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers. Haplotype analysis indicated that 83 out of 115 current wheat breeding lines from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) likely carry Sr2. Among those, five out of 94 CIMMYT spring lines tested had both Sr2 and Sr25 haplotypes. Five out of 22 Agriculture Research Service (ARS) lines likely have Sr2 and a few have Sr24, Sr36, and 1A.1R. Two out of 43 Chinese accessions have Sr2. No line was found to have the Sr26 and Sr40 haplotypes in this panel of accessions. DArT genotyping was used to identify new markers associated with the major stem resistance genes. Four DArT markers were significantly associated with Sr2 and one with Sr25. Principal component analysis grouped wheat lines from similar origins. Almost all CIMMYT spring wheats were clustered together as a large group and separated from the winter wheats. The results provide useful information for stem rust resistance breeding and pyramiding.

AB Resistance of wheat to diseases such as fusarium head blight (FHB) and leaf rust is more effective and durable when resistance genes are stacked. This study investigated whether pairs of disease resistance genes will become fixed at higher frequencies in subsequent generations when placed in the hemizygous condition using telocentric chromosomes. Three pairs of telocentric chromosomes were tested for their male and female transmission to predict the fixation rate of hemizygous chromosome arms using reciprocal testcrosses. Hemizygous arm transmission was about 50% through ovules and about 75% through pollen because of pollen certation. To test if a corresponding increase in disease resistance could be observed in populations utilizing telocentric chromosomes, three resistance gene pairs were analyzed separately in three populations. These pairs were Lr16/Lr34 and Lr22a/Lr52 for resistance to leaf rust and Fhb1/Qfhs.ifa-5A for FHB resistance. Each of these gene combinations was involved in a crossing and selection scheme that identified F(1) plants that were either dihybrid or double monotelodisomic (DMTD). For each resistance gene combination F(3) families were produced for phenotypic testing. The Lr16/Lr34 and Lr22a/Lr52 F(3) populations both showed a sharp increase in leaf rust resistance among families derived from DMTD F(1) plants compared to those from dihybrid F(1) plants. A smaller increased resistance was found in the FHB population. The increased frequency of resistance was attributed to pollen certation and zygotic selection against the ditelosomic and double ditelosomic conditions. We conclude that telocentric chromosomes are a viable breeding tool to fix gene stacks.

AB We present the results of the first molecular mapping work on resistance to bacterial stalk rot (BSR) caused by Pectobacterium chrysanthemi pv. zeae Burk., McFad. and Dim. in tropical white maize. Molecular marker analysis of the P8 (BSR-susceptible) and YIF62 (BSR-resistant) parental inbred lines generated a total of 102 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and resistance gene analog (RGA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA markers. Using the F(2) population of P8 x YIF62, we constructed a genetic linkage map consisting of 77 (35 SSR, 34 AFLP, 8 RGA) markers covering a distance of 932.8 cM with approximately 12.1 cM marker density, which is about 54% of the total map length of the maize standard map. Using the F(2) linkage map and phenotyping data from F(2:3) progenies, we identified a major genomic region located in chromosome 2 which was associated with resistance to BSR. The genomic region showed additive genetic effects which accounted for approximately 26% of the variation observed in BSR resistance.

AB P>The present study was undertaken for developing a pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) tolerant and leaf rust resistant wheat genotype using marker-assisted selection (MAS). A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) (QPhs.ccsu-3A.1) for PHS tolerance (PHST) identified by us earlier was introgressed into HD2329, which is an elite but PHS susceptible cultivar, and carried two Lr genes (Lr24 + Lr28) earlier introgressed by us using MAS. In each backcross generation, foreground selection for PHS QTL was exercised using flanking markers (gwm155 and wmc153), and background selection was performed using 61 simple sequence repeat loci spread over the whole genome. During backcrossing, the desirable alleles of Lr24 and Lr28, were also tracked using linked SCAR markers. Seven BC(3)F(3) progenies having desirable PHST QTL and Lr genes, and showing up to 93.44% genetic similarity with the recipient parent were selected. These lines exhibited high level of PHST (PHS score 2-4) and resistance against leaf rust under artificial conditions. The study demonstrated successful application of MAS for targeted pyramiding of QTL/genes for more than one trait into an improved wheat cultivar.

AB The developing world has many unique constraints to crop production and, lacking inputs, they are best overcome if solutions are seed borne. Classical breeding cannot overcome many of these constraints because the species have attained a 'genetic glass ceiling', the genes are not available within the species. Transgenics can supply the genes, but typically not as 'hand me down genes' from the developed world because of the unique problems: mainly parasitic weeds, and weedy rice, stem borers and post-harvest insects, viral diseases, tropical mycotoxins, anti-feedants, toxic heavy metals and mineral deficiencies. Public sector involvement is imperative for genetically engineering against these constraints, as the private biotechnology sector does not see the developing world as a viable market in most instances. Rice, sorghum, barley, wheat and millets have related weeds, and in certain cases, transgenic gene containment and/or mitigation is necessary to prevent establishment of transgenes in the weedy relatives.

AB A set of 85 Aegilops tauschii accessions were evaluated for morphological traits, disease resistance, high molecular weight glutenin subunits and genetic diversity using D genome specific SSR markers. Screening for leaf rust, stripe rust and Kernel bunt (KB) resistance over four years identified Ae. tauschii ssp strangulate as a potential source for new leaf rust and stripe rust resistance genes and Ae. tauschii ssp tauschii as a source for KB resistance. The Ac. tauschii germplasm also showed a lot of variability for high molecular weight glutenin profile showing 16 combinations of slow (1Dx) and fast (1Dy) mobility subunits. A total of 51 D-genome specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers amplified a total of 241 alleles in 85 accessions of Ac. tauschii and two bread wheat cultivars. The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 11 with an average of 4.75. Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) values for all the 51 primer pairs ranged from 0.02 to 0.88 with an average of 0.62. A phylogenetic tree generated, based on Dice dissimilarity matrix and cluster analysis, led to the clustering of the Ac tauschii accessions into two major groups. The cluster I comprised primarily the strangulate accessions whereas the cluster II comprised of accessions belonging to both the subspecies indicating some gene flow from ssp strangulate to tauschii. Genetically diverse Ac. tauschii accessions with disease resistance and better agronomic and quality traits are being used for the introgression of desirable traits to bread wheat for commercial exploitation.

AB Leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.) is a worldwide and yield-limiting disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The gene Lr32, which confers seedling resistance to leaf rust, was previously transferred from Aegilops tauschii Coss. (RL5497-1) to chromosome 3DS of common wheat. Without exception, Lr32 conferred resistance to 616 diverse isolates of leaf rust sampled from Canadian wheat fields over the past decade (2000 to 2009). Marker alleles specific to chromosome 3DS of RL5497 were found in Lr32 backcross lines of both Katepwa (BW196R) and Thatcher (RL6086). These introgressions from A. tauschii had no adverse effects on either agronomic performance or end use quality. A map based on 338 doubled haploid lines (DHL) from the cross of BW196R x Thatcher showed that Lr32 was slightly distal (0.6 cM) to two simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci wmc43 and barc135, which cosegregated on chromosome 3DS. A survey of the fragments amplified in wheats of diverse origin showed that both wmc43 and barc135 were cross-applicable as markers for stacking Lr32 with other broadly effective leaf rust resistance genes.

AB RL6137, a 'Thatcher' backcross line of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has resistance to Puccinia triticina (causal agent of wheat leaf rust) derived from T monococcum. To determine the chromosome location of this resistance, RL6137 was crossed with Thatcher and F(2) individual seedlings were tested for segregation of leaf rust resistance and segregation of polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Leaf rust resistance genotypes of F(2) individuals were confirmed with segregation of F(3) families. The F(2) seedlings and F(3) families segregated for a single leaf rust resistance gene. The SSR markers barc 57 and barc 321 located on chromosome 3AS were tightly linked with the leaf rust resistance gene. The leaf rust resistance gene in RL6137 was designated as Lr63. This gene conditions low to intermediate infection types to most P. triticina isolates and can be used in wheat improvement programs to enhance leaf rust resistance.

AB The scientific community has long assumed that plant breeding activities decrease genetic diversity in crop species. To determine the influence of plant breeding on peanut, this study was designed to assess allelic diversity changes among peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivars of the runner market type using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. All runner-type cultivars released to date were included with the exception of ten cultivars released in the 2000s. Thirty-four SSR primer pairs amplified a total of 154 alleles. The results indicated that (i) at the gene level, allelic diversity has increased significantly through decades of breeding, (ii) at the population level, genetic diversity was at its lowest during the pre-1980s time period and gradually increased in each subsequent decade, and (iii) most of the observed SSR variation occurred within, rather than among time periods. A principal coordinate analysis (PCO) clearly demonstrated increases in the variation present in each subsequent breeding decade, reaching its maximum in the 2000s. Therefore, it appears that runner-type peanut breeders have been successful at developing improved peanut cultivars while increasing levels of diversity in the last three decades of breeding. In addition, genetic relationships among cultivars reported in this study might be of use for peanut breeders when selecting parents for establishment of breeding populations.

AB Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is the causal agent of stem rust of wheat. A new race designated TTKSK (also known as Ug99) and its variants (TTKST and TTTSK) are virulent to most of the stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in wheat cultivars worldwide. Therefore, identification, mapping, and deployment of effective resistance genes are critical components of global efforts to mitigate this threat. Multipathotype seedling tests demonstrated that resistance gene Sr35 is effective against the three TTKS variants and another broadly virulent race from Yemen, TRTTF. Two genetic maps of Sr35 are presented in diploid (Triticum monococcum) and two in hexaploid wheat (T aestivum). The Sr35 resistance to TRTTF and RKQQC races was mapped in diploid wheat within a 2.2 to 3.1 cM interval on the long arm of chromosome 3A(m) between markers XBF483299 and XCJ656351. This interval corresponds to a 174-kb region in Brachypodium that includes 16 annotated genes. The Sr35 map location was confirmed in two backcross-derived hexaploid populations segregating for Sr35. Recombination between diploid and hexaploid chromosomes was 10-fold lower than between homologous chromosomes, but was sufficient to reduce the introgressed diploid segment. These maps provide markers closely linked to Sr35 that will be useful to accelerate its deployment and pyramiding with other stem rust resistance genes.

AB Wheat yellow mosaic, caused by Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), is one of the most devastating soil-borne diseases of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Japan. Yellow-striped leaves and stunted spring growth, symptomatic of WYMV infection, result in severe yield loss. A new putative WYMV resistance gene in the European wheat cultivar 'Ibis' was mapped in the cluster of microsatellite markers including Xcfd16, Xwmc41, Xcfd168 and Xwmc181 on the long arm of chromosome 2D at the distances of 2.0 cM, 4.0 cM, 7.1 cM and 12.4 cM, respectively. WYMV-resistant cultivars contained a common haplotype of the four markers, whereas moderately susceptible and susceptible cultivars did not. These results should be useful in marker-assisted selection for WYMV resistance in wheat.

AB The foliar wheat disease septoria tritici blotch can cause significant yield losses. A source of resistance has been mapped on chromosome 7D of spelt wheat, Triticum aestivum L. subsp. spelta (L.) Thell. The microsatellite-based genetic map was constructed from a set of 87 single-chromosome recombinant doubled-haploid lines bred from the cross between the landrace 'Chinese Spring' and a 'Chinese Spring'-based line carrying chromosome 7D from spelt wheat. Two regions of the chromosome were associated with isolate-specific QTL expressed one at the seedling and another at the adult plant stage. The seedling resistance locus QStb.ipk-7D1 was found in the centromeric region of chromosome 7D, which corresponds to the location of the major resistance genes Stb4 originating from bread wheat cultivar 'Tadinia' and Stb5 originating from Triticum tauschii. The adult resistance locus QStb.ipk-7D2 was found on the short arm of chromosome 7D in a similar position to the locus Lr34/Yr18 known to be effective against multiple pathogens. Composite interval mapping confirmed QStb.ipk-7D1 and QStb.ipk-7D2 to be two distinct loci.

AB The evolution of five chromosomes of Brachypodium distachyon from a 12-chromosome ancestor of all grasses by dysploidy raises an interesting question about the fate of redundant centromeres. Three independent but complementary approaches were pursued to study centromeric region homologies among the chromosomes of Brachypodium, wheat, and rice. The genes present in pericentromeres of the basic set of seven chromosomes of wheat and the Triticeae, and the 80 rice centromeric genes spanning the CENH3 binding domain of centromeres 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were used as "anchor" markers to identify centromere locations in the B. distachyon chromosomes. A total of 53 B. distachyon bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones anchored by wheat pericentromeric expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used as probes for BAC-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of B. distachyon mitotic chromosomes. Integrated sequence alignment and BAC-FISH data were used to determine the approximate positions of active and inactive centromeres in the five B. distachyon chromosomes. The following syntenic relationships of the centromeres for Brachypodium (Bd), rice (R), and wheat (W) were evident: Bd1 -R6, Bd2-R5-W I, Bd3-R10, Bd4-R11-W4, and Bd5-R4. Six rice centromeres syntenic to five wheat centromeres were inactive in Brachypodium chromosomes. The conservation of centromere gene synteny among several sets of homologous centromeres of three species indicates that active genes can persist in ancient centromeres with more than 40 million years of shared evolutionary history. Annotation of a BAC contig spanning an inactive centromere in chromosome Bd3 which is syntenic to rice Cen8 and W7 pericentromeres, along with BAC FISH data from inactive centromeres revealed that the centromere inactivation was accompanied by the loss of centromeric retrotransposons and turnover of centromere-specific satellites during Bd chromosome evolution.

AB The barley mutant allele sdw3 confers a gibberellin-insensitive, semi-dwarf phenotype with potential for breeding of new semi-dwarfed barley cultivars. Towards map-based cloning, sdw3 was delimited by high-resolution genetic mapping to a 0.04 cM interval in a "cold spot" of recombination of the proximal region of the short arm of barley chromosome 2H. Extensive synteny between the barley Sdw3 locus (Hvu_sdw3) and the orthologous regions (Osa_sdw3, Sbi_sdw3, Bsy_sdw3) of three other grass species (Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium sylvaticum) allowed for efficient synteny-based marker saturation in the target interval. Comparative sequence analysis revealed colinearity for 23 out of the 38, 35, and 29 genes identified in Brachypodium, rice, and Sorghum, respectively. Markers co-segregating with Hvu_sdw3 were generated from two of these genes. Initial attempts at chromosome walking in barley were performed with seven orthologous gene probes which were delimiting physical distances of 223, 123, and 127 kb in Brachypodium, rice, and Sorghum, respectively. Six non-overlapping small bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone contigs (cumulative length of 670 kb) were obtained, which indicated a considerably larger physical size of Hvu_sdw3. Low-pass sequencing of selected BAC clones from these barley contigs exhibited a substantially lower gene frequency per physical distance and the presence of additional non-colinear genes. Four candidate genes for sdw3 were identified within barley BAC sequences that either co-segregated with the gene sdw3 or were located adjacent to these co-segregating genes. Identification of genic sequences in the sdw3 context provides tools for marker-assisted selection. Eventual identification of the actual gene will contribute new information for a basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying growth regulation in barley.

AB Aluminium (Al(3+)) toxicity restricts productivity and profitability of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops grown on acid soils worldwide. Continued gains will be obtained by identifying superior alleles and novel Al(3+) resistance loci that can be incorporated into breeding programs. We used association mapping to identify genomic regions associated with Al(3+) resistance using 1055 accessions of common wheat from different geographic regions of the world and 178 polymorphic diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers. Bayesian analyses based on genetic distance matrices classified these accessions into 12 subgroups. Genome-wide association analyses detected markers that were significantly associated with Al(3+) resistance on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B. Some of these genomic regions correspond to previously identified loci for Al(3+) resistance, whereas others appear to be novel. Among the markers targeting TaALMT1 (the major Al(3+)-resistance gene located on chromosome 4D), those that detected alleles in the promoter explained most of the phenotypic variance for Al(3+) resistance, which is consistent with this region controlling the level of TaALMT1 expression. These results demonstrate that genome-wide association mapping cannot only confirm known Al(3+)-resistance loci, such as those on chromsomes 4D and 4B, but they also highlight the utility of this technique in identifying novel resistance loci.

AB Two highly effective genes for leaf rust resistance viz., Lr24, Lr28 and a stripe rust resistance gene Yr15 were selected for pyramiding in the background of a susceptible but high yielding bread wheat variety HD2877. The screening against most virulent pathotypes of leaf rust 77-5 (121R63-1) and stripe rust, 46S119 and 78S84 indicated that all the three genes confer a high degree of seedling and adult plant resistance, The use of molecular markers, namely, SCS1302(607), SCS421(570) and Xgwm273 validated the presence of resistance genes, Lr24 and Yr15 in Sunstar*(6)/C80-1/N763-2312 and Lr28 in HW2033 both being donors. The application of molecular markers facilitated identification of individual plants in three-way cross (HD2877 x Sunstar*6/C80-1/N763-2312) x HW2033, SCI-FI and BC(2)-F(1) generations possessing the targeted genes. Finally eight plants were selected in BC(2) -F(2) generation carrying the desired resistance genes, Lr24, Lr28 and Yr15 in different combinations in the background of HD2877. The availability of combination of major rust resistance genes in desirable background would facilitate the strategic deployment of wheat varieties to achieve durable resistance.

AB The barley male sterility gene (msg6) located on chromosome 6H has been used in breeding and research since its discovery 7 decades ago, but to date, no research has been reported that linked the gene with molecular markers. The main objective of this study was to identify expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers linked to msg6 as this could provide opportunities for gene discovery. In a cross of a male sterile line (04-042B) with a fully fertile line (VB0330; VB9524/Mundah), male sterility segregated in a 3: 1 ratio of fertile to completely sterile plants (chi(2) = 0.03, P(0.05) = 0.95), in a population of 250 F(2) plants. Multipoint linkage mapping placed the msg6 gene at 4.9 cM from the EST-SSR, GBM1267, whereas 2-point analysis estimated a recombination fraction of 0.05 +/- 0.02 (logarithm of the odds score = 26.34) between the EST-SSR and the male sterility gene. Multiple interval quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of spike weight, an indicative measure of reproductive success, identified a QTL near GBM1267 as having a major influence, explaining 68.7% of the variation in weight of individual spikes. The GBM1267 marker segregated in a 1:2:1 ratio, which makes it highly desirable for marker-assisted selection, as it can distinguish the recessive from the dominant and from heterozygous individuals. Another EST-SSR marker, designated VBMS103, was developed in the present study to provide an additional marker with known sequence (AL501881) close to the msg6 gene. The results provide highly informative functional tools for tracking the msg6 gene in breeding programs.

AB A major objective of quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies is to find genes/markers that can be used in breeding programs via marker assisted selection (MAS). We surveyed the QTLs for yield and yield-related traits and their genomic distributions in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the available published reports. We then carried out a meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis to identify the major and consistent QTLs for these traits. In total, 55 MQTLs were identified, of which 12 significant MQTLs were located on wheat chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2D, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D and 5A. Our study showed that the genetic control of yield and its components in common wheat involved the important genes such as Rht and Vrn. Furthermore, several significant MQTLs were found in the chromosomal regions corresponding to several rice genomic locations containing important QTLs for yield related traits. Our results demonstrate that meta-QTL analysis is a powerful tool for confirming the major and stable QTLs and refining their chromosomal positions in common wheat, which may be useful for improving the MAS efficiency of yield related traits.

TI Marker Development and Saturation Mapping of the Tan Spot Ptr ToxB
   Sensitivity Locus Tsc2 in Hexaploid Wheat
SO PLANT GENOME
LA English
DT Article
AB Ptr ToxB is a host-selective toxin produced by the tan spot fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, that induces chlorosis in wheat lines harboring the Tsc2 gene, which was previously mapped to chromosome arm 2BS in tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.). In this study, molecular mapping in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the Ptr ToxB-sensitive 'Katepwa' and the Ptr ToxB-insensitive landrace Salamouni (Salamouni x Katepwa [SK] population) confirmed the location of Tsc2 on 2BS in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analysis of an F 2 population derived from the same parents indicated that a single dominant gene governed Ptr ToxB sensitivity. Thirteen microsatellite markers were used to construct a basic linkage map of the Tsc2 region in the SK population, and 14 additional markers developed from bin-mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and from ESTs identified based on colinearity with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. were mapped to the Tsc2 region. Tsc2 was delineated to a 3.3 cM interval and cosegregated with marker XBE444541. Spore inoculations and composite interval-regression mapping demonstrated that a compatible Tsc2-Ptr ToxB interaction accounted for 54% of the variation in disease expression. Analysis of Ptr ToxB-sensitive and-insensitive genotypes suggested that XBE444541 is diagnostic for Tsc2 and should be useful for marker-assisted selection.

AB Acid soils limit plant production worldwide because their high concentrations of soluble aluminium cations (Al(3+)) inhibit root growth. Major food crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have evolved mechanisms to resist Al(3+) toxicity, thus enabling wider distribution. The origins of Al(3+) resistance in wheat are perplexing because all progenitors of this hexaploid species are reportedly sensitive to Al(3+) stress. The large genotypic variation for Al(3+) resistance in wheat is largely controlled by expression of an anion channel, TaALMT1, which releases malate anions from the root apices. A current hypothesis proposes that the malate anions protect this sensitive growth zone by binding to Al(3+) in the apoplasm. We investigated the evolution of this trait in wheat, and demonstrated that it has multiple independent origins that enhance Al(3+) resistance by increasing TaALMT1 expression. One origin is likely to be Aegilops tauschii while other origins occurred more recently from a series of cis mutations that have generated tandemly repeated elements in the TaALMT1 promoter. We generated transgenic plants to directly compare these promoter alleles and demonstrate that the tandemly repeated elements act to enhance gene expression. This study provides an example from higher eukaryotes in which perfect tandem repeats are linked with transcriptional regulation and phenotypic change in the context of evolutionary adaptation to a major abiotic stress.

AB Plant oil content and composition improvement is a major goal of plant breeding and biotechnology. The Puroindoline a and b (PINA and PINB) proteins together control whether wheat seeds are soft or hard textured and share a similar structure to that of plant non-specific lipid-transfer proteins. Here we transformed corn (Zea mays L.) with the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) puroindoline genes (Pina and Pinb) to assess their effects upon seed oil content and quality. Pina and Pinb coding sequences were introduced into corn under the control of a corn Ubiquitin promoter. Three Pina/Pinb expression positive transgenic events were evaluated over two growing seasons. The results showed that Pin expression increased germ size significantly without negatively impacting seed size. Germ yield increased 33.8% while total seed oil content was increased by 25.23%. Seed oil content increases were primarily the result of increased germ size. This work indicates that higher oil content corn hybrids having increased food or feed value could be produced via puroindoline expression.

AB A proteomic analysis was conducted to map the events during the initial stages of the interaction between the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum and the susceptible barley cultivar Scarlett. Quantification of fungal DNA demonstrated a sharp increase in fungal biomass in barley spikelets at 3 days after inoculation. This coincided with the appearance of discrete F. graminearum-induced proteolytic fragments of beta-amylase. Based on these results, analysis of grain proteome changes prior to extensive proteolysis enabled identification of barley proteins responding early to infection by the fungus. In total, the intensity of 51 protein spots was significantly changed in F. graminearum-infected spikelets and all but one were identified. These included pathogenesis-related proteins, proteins involved in energy metabolism, secondary metabolism and protein synthesis. A single fungal protein of unknown function was identified. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of selected genes showed a correlation between high gene expression and detection of the corresponding proteins. Fungal genes encoding alkaline protease and endothiapepsin were expressed during 1-3 days after inoculation, making them candidates for generation of the observed beta-amylase fragments. These fragments have potential to be developed as proteome-level markers for fungal infection that are also informative about grain protein quality.

AB A series of expressed sequence tags-derived polymerase chain reaction (EST-PCR) markers specific to chromosome 2Ai#2 from Thinopyrum intermedium were developed in this study using a new integrative approach. The target alien chromosome confers high resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which is a severe virus disease in wheat. To generate markers evenly distributed on 2Ai#2, a total of 105 primer pairs were designed based on mapped ESTs from 8 bins of wheat chromosome 2B with intron-prediction by aligning ESTs with genomic sequences of the new model plant Brachypodium distachyon. Eight and seven polymorphic markers on the short arm and the long arm of chromosome 2Ai#2, respectively, were obtained with a polymorphism rate of 14.3%. These chromosome 2Ai#2-specific EST-PCR markers were then used in tracing and exploring the structural variation of the alien chromosome in the population derived from the immature embryo culture of the cross between N452, a 2Ai#2(2D) substitution line, and common wheat CB037. Two centric fusion of translocations involving 2Ai#2 short or long arm with wheat chromosome 2D and some new genetic stocks including telosomes with the alien chromosome short or long arm were identified in the SC(3) generations, which provided basic materials to further study the mechanism of the BYDV resistance. BYDV tests in two field seasons suggest that the BYDV resistance was mainly conferred by the short arm, gene interaction on both arms of the alien chromosome was discussed.

AB Musa (banana and plantain) is an important genus for the global export market and in local markets where it provides staple food for approximately 400 million people. Hybridization and polyploidization of several (sub)species, combined with vegetative propagation and human selection have produced a complex genetic history. We describe the application of the Ecotilling method for the discovery and characterization of nucleotide polymorphisms in diploid and polyploid accessions of Musa. We discovered over 800 novel alleles in 80 accessions. Sequencing and band evaluation shows Ecotilling to be a robust and accurate platform for the discovery of polymorphisms in homologous and homeologous gene targets. In the process of validating the method, we identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms that may be deleterious for the function of a gene putatively important for phototropism. Evaluation of heterozygous polymorphism and haplotype blocks revealed a high level of nucleotide diversity in Musa accessions. We further applied a strategy for the simultaneous discovery of heterozygous and homozygous polymorphisms in diploid accessions to rapidly evaluate nucleotide diversity in accessions of the same genome type. This strategy can be used to develop hypotheses for inheritance patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms within and between genome types. We conclude that Ecotilling is suitable for diversity studies in Musa, that it can be considered for functional genomics studies and as tool in selecting germplasm for traditional and mutation breeding approaches.

AB Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide and breeding for resistance using diversified disease resistance genes is the most promising approach to prevent outbreaks of powdery mildew. A powdery mildew resistance gene, originating from wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) accessions collected from Israel, has been transferred into the hexaploid wheat line 3D232 through crossing and backcrossing. Inoculation results with 21 B. graminis f. sp. tritici races indicated that 3D232 is resistant to all of the powdery mildew isolates tested. Genetic analyses of 3D232 using an F(2) segregating population and F(3) families indicated that a single dominant gene, Ml3D232, confers resistance in the host seedling stage. By applying molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis (BSA), we have identified polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR), expressed sequence tags (EST) and derived sequence tagged site (STS) markers to determine that the Ml3D232 is located on chromosome 5BL bin 0.59-0.76. Comparative genetic analyses using mapped EST markers and genome sequences of rice and Brachypodium established co-linearity of the Ml3D232 genomic region with a 1.4 Mb genomic region on Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 4, and a 1.2 Mb contig located on the Oryza sativa chromosome 9. Our comparative approach enabled us to develop new EST-STS markers and to delimit the genomic region carrying Ml3D232 to a 0.8 cM segment that is collinear with a 558 kb region on B. distachyon. Eight EST markers, including an NBS-LRR analog, co-segregated with Ml3D232 to provide a target site for fine genetic mapping, chromosome landing and map-based cloning of the powdery mildew resistance gene. This newly developed common wheat germplasm provides broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew and a valuable resource for wheat breeding programs.

AB Better understanding of genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is expected to provide a solid foundation for genetic improvement of crop productivity especially under drought-prone environments. To elucidate the genetic basis of the plant and ear height, 2 F(2:3) populations were derived from the crosses of Qi 319 x Huangzaosi (Q/H) and Ye 478 x Huangzaosi (Y/H) with 230 and 235 families, respectively, and their parents were evaluated under 3 diverse environments in Henan, Beijing, and Xinjiang, China during the year of 2007 and 2008, and all the lines were also evaluated under water stress environment. The mapping results showed that a total of 21 and 12 QTLs were identified for plant height in the Q/H and Y/H population, respectively, and 24 and 13 QTLs for ear height, respectively. About 56 and 73% of the QTLs for 2 traits did not present significant QTL-by-environment interaction (QEI) in the normal joint analyses for Q/H and Y/H population, respectively, and about 73% of the QTLs detected did not show significant QEI according to joint analyses for stress condition in Q/H. Most of the detected major QTLs exhibited high stability across different environments. Besides, several major QTLs were detected with large and consistent effect under normal condition (Chr. 6 and 7 in Q/H; Chr. 1, 3 and 9 in Y/H), or across 2 water regimes (Chr. 1, 8 and 10 for in Q/H). There were several constitutive QTLs (3 for Q/H and 1 for Y/H) with no or minor QTL-by-environment for the 2 populations. Finally, we found several genomic regions (Chr. 1, 10, etc.) to be co-located across the populations, which could provide useful reference for genetic improvement of these traits in maize breeding programs. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that 3 genes/genetic segments associated with plant height in rice were orthologous to these 3 identified genomic regions carrying the major QTLs for plant and ear height on Chr. 1, 6, and 8, respectively.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the major diseases of wheat in China. In order to asses the resistance levels and existing Yr genes among 59 wheat cultivars (lines) from the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States, to provide resistance resources for genetic improvement of wheat stripe rust resistance in China, 59 wheat cultivars (lines) from PNW of the United States were infected by 3 mixed races of predominant Chinese stripe rust races CRY31, CRY32, and CRY33 to evaluate their resistance at seedling and adult plant stages, and screened with molecular markers tightly linked to currently effective all-stage resistance genes Yr10, Yr15 and adult plant resistance genes Yr18, Yr39. Of 59 American cultivars (lines), five cultivars (lines), Expresso, 02W50076, ACS52610, WA008012, and WA00801833, had all-stage resistance, showing resistance to mixed races of CRY31, CRY32, and CRY33 at both seedling and adult plant stages. 33 cultivars (lines) had adult plant resistance, only showing resistance to stripe rust at adult stage. Based on the molecular screening, none of the 59 PNW cultivars (lines) had the polymorphic bands of linked markers to Yr10. There were 12, 33 and 29 cultivars (lines) which had polymorphic bands of linked markers to Yr15, Yr18 and Yr39, accounting for 20, 55 and 49% of the 59 PNW cultivars (lines), respectively. All these results suggested that Yr15, Yr18 and Yr39 were widespread among PNW cultivars (cultivars) and could be utilized in Chinese wheat stripe rust resistance breeding.

AB Large-scale proteomics of three wild relatives of wheat grain (A, B, and D genomes) were analyzed by using multidimensional protein identification technology coupled to liquid chromatography quadruple mass spectrometry. A total of 1568 (peptide match >= 1) and 255 (peptide match >= 2) unique proteins were detected and classified, which represents the most wide-ranging proteomic exploitation to date. The development of standard proteomes exhibiting all of the proteins involved in normal physiology will facilitate the delineation of disease/defense, metabolism, energy metabolism, and protein synthesis. A relative proteome exploration of the expression patterns indicates that proteins are involved in abiotic and biotic stress. Functional category analysis indicates that these differentially expressed proteins are mainly involved in disease/defense (15.38%, 21.26%, and 16.78%), metabolism (8.39%, 12.07%, and 14.09%), energy metabolism (11.19%, 11.49%, and 13.42%), protein synthesis (9.09%, 9.20%, and 8.72%), cell growth and division (9.09%, 4.60%, and 6.04%), cellular organization (4.20%, 5.75%, and 5.37%), development (6.29%, 2.87%, 3.36%), folding and stability (6.29%, 8.62%, and 8.05%), signal transduction (11.19%, 7.47%, and 8.05%), storage protein (4.20%, 1.72%, and 2.01%), transcription (5.59%, 5.17%, and 4.03%), and transport facilitation (1.40%, 1.15%, and 3.36%) in A, B, and D genomes, respectively. Here, we reported genome-specific protein interaction network using Cytoscape software, which provides further insight into the molecular functions and mechanism of biochemical pathways. We provide a promising understanding about the expressed proteins and protein functions. Our approach should be applicable as a marker to assist in breeding or gene transfer for quality and stress research of cultivated wheat.

AB Head blight, caused by Gibberella zeae, is a significant disease among cereal crops, including wheat, barley, and rice, due to contamination of grain with mycotoxins. G. zeae is spread by ascospores forcibly discharged from sexual fruiting bodies forming on crop residues. In this study, we characterized a novel gene, ROA, which is required for normal sexual development. Deletion of ROA (Delta roa) resulted in an abnormal size and shape of asci and ascospores but did not affect vegetative growth. The Delta roa mutation triggered round ascospores and insufficient cell division after spore delimitation. The asci of the Delta roa strain discharged fewer ascospores from the perithecia but achieved a greater dispersal distance than those of the wild-type strain. Turgor pressure within the asci was calculated through the analysis of osmolytes in the epiplasmic fluid. Deletion of the ROA gene appeared to increase turgor pressure in the mutant asci. The higher turgor pressure of the Delta roa mutant asci and the mutant spore shape contributed to the longer distance dispersal. When the Delta roa mutant was outcrossed with a Delta mat1-2 mutant, a strain that contains a green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker in place of the MAT1-2 gene, unusual phenotypic segregation occurred. The ratio of GFP to non-GFP segregation was 1: 1; however, all eight spores had the same shape. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that ROA plays multiple roles in maintaining the proper morphology and discharge of ascospores in G. zeae.

AB Associations of PCR markers with freezing tolerance and acclimation of photosynthetic apparatus to cold were tested on 28 winter barley cultivars and advanced breeding forms to select alleles for practical application in marker assisted selection (MAS). We found significant associations between freezing tolerance evaluated with field-laboratory method (FLM) and markers located on 5H chromosome in region of gene Fr-H2 (bin9-10: Xbmag812, Xmwg2230) and region of gene Fr-H1 (bin11: Xmwg514, HvBM5, Xmwg644). Additionally, significant associations with photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence (q(P)) were found for PCR markers Xpsr115 and Xmwg2062. In our study variation in the promoter region of Vrn-H1 (HvBM5) was directly connected with freezing tolerance of plants partially de-acclimated in the field. The results obtained here showed that different loci of freezing tolerance may play role in variable selection pressure of winter conditions.

AB Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy is a diploid, wild relative of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Previous studies showed that D. villosum chromosome 1V has genes that encode seed storage proteins that may be used to enhance the grain quality of bread wheat. As a first step in genetic transfer, the present study was initiated to develop compensating Robertsonian translocations involving wheat chromosome 1D and D. villosum chromosome 1V and to analyze their effects on grain quality. A monosomic 1D stock was crossed with the disomic addition stock DA1V#3 and the double monosomic plants (20 '' + 1D' + 1V#3') were self pollinated. Two co-dominant STS markers (BE499250 and BE591682) polymorphic for the short arm of 1V#3S and two dominant STS markers (BE518358 and BE585781) polymorphic for the long arm of 1V#3L were developed to screen a large number of progeny to identify plants that had only the 1V#3S or 1V#3L arms. Five compensating Robertsonian heterozygous translocations, two (plants #56 and #83) for the short arm (T1DL.1V#3S)and three (plants #7, #123, and #208) for the long arm (T1DS.1V#3L) were identified from 282 F(2) plants and confirmed by genomic in situ hybridization and C-banding analyses. Two homozygous translocations T1DL.1V#3S (plants #14 and #39) were identified from 52 F(3) plants derived from F(2) plant #83. Four homozygous translocations T1DS.1V#3L (plants #3, #22, #29, and #30) were identified from 68 F(3) plants derived from F(2) plant #208. The homozygous translocation T1DL.1V#3S had a significantly higher (37.4 ml) and T1DS.1V#3L had significantly lower (10 ml) Zeleny sedimentation values compared to Chinese Spring wheat (30.7 ml). Our results showed that 1V#3S increased gluten strength and enhanced wheat quality, but 1V#3L decreased gluten strength and did not enhance wheat quality.

AB Pericarp color in wheat is an important trait related to nutrients and health benefits. Identification of molecular markers closely linked to the grain color genes will help utilize pericarp trait in wheat breeding. Genetic studies involving F(1), F(2), and F(3) populations from the cross Jizi 439 (purple grain)/Gao8901 (white grain) showed that the purple grain color was controlled by two genes. By using the bulked segregant analysis (BSA) approach, two DNA pools were established from the dark purple-grain and white-grain plants respectively. Among the 230 pairs of microsatellite primers used in this study, two markers showed polymorphism in DNA pools, parents, F(1) and F(2) populations. Linkage analysis indicated that the two markers Xgwm47 and Xgwm155 were linked with two purple pigment genes. One of the purple pigment genes is located on chromosome 2AS and is 34.7cM away from the marker Xgwm47, whereas another gene is mapped on 3AL with 14.7cM away from marker Xgwm155.

AB Cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is considered as a non-host or inappropriate host species for wheat stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. Most barley cultivars show a broad-spectrum resistance to wheat stripe rust. To determine the genes for resistance to wheat stripe rust in barley, a cross was made between a resistant barley line Y12 and a susceptible line Y16. The two parents, F(1) and 147 BC(1) plants were tested at seedling stage with Chinese prevalent race CYR32 of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici by artificial inoculation in greenhouse. The results indicated that Y12 possessed one dominant resistance gene to wheat stripe rust, designated YrpstY1 provisionally. A total of 388 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the resistance gene in Y12 using bulked segregant analysis. A linkage map, including nine SSR loci on chromosome 7H and YrpstY1, was constructed using the BC(1) population, indicating that the resistance gene YrpstY1 is located on chromosome 7H. It is potential to transfer the resistance gene into common wheat for stripe rust resistance.

AB The fungus Fusarium globosum was first isolated from maize in South Africa and subsequently from wheat in Japan. Here, multiple analyses revealed that, despite morphological similarities, South African maize and Japanese wheat isolates of the fungus exhibit multiple differences. An amplified fragment length polymorphism-based similarity index for the two groups of isolates was only 45%. Most maize isolates produced relatively high levels of fumonisins, whereas wheat isolates produced little or no fumonisins. The fumonisin biosynthetic gene FUM1 was detected in maize isolates by Southern blot analysis but not in the wheat isolates. In addition, most of the maize isolates produced sclerotia, and all of them produced large orange to dark purple sporodochia in carrot agar culture, whereas wheat isolates did not produce either structure. In contrast, individual isolates from both maize and wheat carried markers for both mating type idiomorphs, which indicates that the fungus may be homothallic. However, a sexual stage of F. globosum was not formed under standard self-fertilization conditions developed for other homothallic species of Fusarium. The inability to produce the sexual stage is consistent with the high similarity of 87-100% and G (ST) index of 1.72 for the maize isolates, which suggests that these isolates are undergoing asexual but not sexual reproduction. Together, the results suggest that the South African maize and Japanese wheat isolates of F. globosum are distinct populations and could be different species.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum in North America. Isolates of F graminearum can be identified as one of three chemotypes: 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON), 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (I5ADON), and nivalenol (NIV). In this study, we characterized F graminearum isolates collected in 1980 to 2000 (old collection) and in 2008 (new collection) from North Dakota and found a I5-fold increase of 3ADON isolates in the new collection. Evaluation of randomly selected 3ADON isolates and 15ADON isolates on three spring wheat genotypes (Grandin. Steele-ND, and ND 2710) by single-floret inoculation indicated that the 3ADON population caused a higher disease severity and produced more DON at a significant level than the 15ADON population on Grandin (susceptible to FHB) and ND 2710 (with FHB resistance from Sumai 3). However, no significant differences in disease severity and DON production were observed between the two populations on Steele-ND (with moderate resistance from Triticum dicoccoides). The 3ADON isolates also exhibited a higher DON production in rice culture and produced more spores on agar media than the 15ADON isolates, suggesting a fitness advantage of the newly emerging 3ADON population over the prevalent 15ADON population. Population genetic analyses using DNA markers revealed a significant genetic differentiation between the two populations. The information obtained in this study could have an impact on development of FHB-resistant wheat cultivars and disease management.

AB P>RE714 is a winter wheat breeding line obtained from two interspecific crosses [(Aegilops tauschii no. 33/Triticum dicoccum no. 119) and VPM = (Aegilops ventricosa no. 10/T. persicum)///Marne]. RE714 expresses powdery mildew resistance at the seedling, vernalized and adult stages. The origin of the main genetic factors involved in RE714 powdery mildew resistance (Pm4b, QPm.inra-5D, QPm.inra-6A2, QPm.inra-7A3a and QPm.inra-7A3b) was studied by comparing alleles of RE714 and those of seven of its parental lines with 36 microsatellite markers previously detected as linked to these factors. VPM, and among its parental lines, the T. persicum accession, were identified as the donor of Pm4b to RE714. Aegilops tauschii no. 33 and T. dicoccum no. 119 were identified as the donors of QPm.inra-5D and QPm.inra-6A2 to RE714, respectively. Beauchamp, a line used at the end of the breeding scheme that created RE714, might be the donor of the favourable alleles of RE714 at quantitative trait loci on linkage group 7A3. These results are discussed in the context of introgression of valuable genetic factors from related species of the primary gene pool into wheat.

AB P>Two greenbug resistance genes Gb2 and Gb6 derived from the same donor rye line 'Insave', are present in wheat germplasm lines 'Amigo' and 'GRS1201', respectively as 1AL.1RS wheat-rye translocations. The allelic relationship between the two genes has not been determined, and no molecular markers for Gb6 are available. In this study, molecular mapping of Gb2 and Gb6 was performed in a mapping population derived from a cross between 'N96L9970' (Gb6Gb6) and 'TAM 107' (Gb2Gb2). Segregation among F(2:3) families of host responses to infestation of greenbug biotypes E and KS-1 revealed that Gb2 and Gb6 were different linked loci in 1RS. Gb2 and Gb6 were 15.8 cM apart with Gb6 being distal to Gb2. Despite the low number of marker polymorphisms between the parental lines, eight markers linked with Gb2 and Gb6 were identified. The closest marker, XIA294, was 11.4 cM proximal to Gb2. Deletion mapping indicated that both Gb2 and Gb6 were physically located in the satellite region of 1RS.

AB To provide insight into the genetic structure of Mycosphaerella graminicola populations in Iran, a total of 221 isolates were collected from naturally infected wheat fields of five major wheat-growing provinces and analysed using AFLP markers and mating-type loci. All populations showed intermediate to high genotypic diversity. In the Golestan and Ardabil populations two mating types were found at near-equal frequencies, whilst all populations were in gametic disequilibrium. Moreover, clonal haplotypes were identified in different sampling sites within a field in both the Khuzestan and Fars provinces, demonstrating that pycnidia are probably the primary source of inoculum. All five populations had low levels of gene diversity and had private bands. Low levels of gene flow and high genetic differentiation were observed among populations and different clustering methods revealed five genetically distinct groups in accordance with the sampling areas. The Golestan and East Azarbaijan populations were more genetically differentiated than the others. Random genetic drift, selection and geographic barriers may account for the differentiation of the populations. The results of this study indicate a population structure of M. graminicola in Iran contrasting to that of most other countries studied.

AB Senescence is the final stage of development in plant tissues. In the senescence process, many senescence-associated genes (SAGs) are reportedly transcriptionally up-regulated. Here, we reported the isolation of nine wheat SAG cDNA clones named TaSAG1 to TaSAG9, and evaluated the usefulness of the SAG homologs for wheat developmental molecular markers based on their expression patterns. The nine wheat SAGs were identified in wheat EST libraries based on their homology to rice SAGs. All wheat SAG transcripts were up-regulated during natural senescence as well as during dark-induced senescence in seedling leaves. However, the expression patterns of wheat SAGs in the flag leaf did not necessarily correspond to those in seedling leaves during senescence. The nine wheat SAGs also showed variable expression patterns in developing and ripening seeds. The transcript accumulation patterns of TaSAG5 and TaSAG6 increased linearly during the period examined in the flag leaf and seed, and are therefore available as molecular markers to respectively evaluate the degree of wheat flag leaf senescence and seed maturation. Transcript accumulation levels of the six SAGs were increased before apparent necrotic cell death of seeding leaves exhibiting wheat hybrid necrosis. These results suggested that necrotic cell death in wheat hybrid necrosis could be closely related not only to senescence but also to defense responses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Previous studies have shown that heterosis is associated with differential gene expression between hybrids and their parents, but the responsible molecular mechanisms have not been determined. Long non-protein coding RNAs (npcRNAs) represent an emerging class of riboregulators, which either act directly in this long form or are processed to shorter miRNAs and siRNAs. Here, a novel npcRNA up-regulated in maize seedling roots of hybrid Zong3/87-1 was identified and named ZmUHR, which comprised multiple members arranged in clusters of 1-4 copies throughout the maize draft genome. Consistent with its preferential expression in young and vigorous growth tissues, promoter sequences of this gene possesses about 10 motifs related to meristem specific activation. Most notably, 41 of 47 siRNAs matched to ZmUHR mRNA were specifically expressed in hybrid and 20 out of 25 (80%) were validated by real-time PCR, which exhibited a good correlation with the up-regulation of ZmUHR gene in hybrid. Collectively, it can be concluded that differential accumulation of some siRNAs may be controlled by transcript levels of the precursor produced, which provide new insights into maize npcRNA biology and the potential roles of this gene in heterosis.

AB Adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and stripe rust derived from the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line PI250413 was previously identified in RL6077 (=Thatcher*6/PI250413). The leaf rust resistance gene in RL6077 is phenotypically similar to Lr34 which is located on chromosome 7D. It was previously hypothesized that the gene in RL6077 could be Lr34 translocated to another chromosome. Hybrids between RL6077 and Thatcher and between RL6077 and 7DS and 7DL ditelocentric stocks were examined for first meiotic metaphase pairing. RL6077 formed chain quadrivalents and trivalents relative to Thatcher and Chinese Spring; however both 7D telocentrics paired only as heteromorphic bivalents and never with the multivalents. Thus, chromosome 7D is not involved in any translocation carried by RL6077. A genome-wide scan of SSR markers detected an introgression from chromosome 4D of PI250413 transferred to RL6077 through five cycles of backcrossing to Thatcher. Haplotype analysis of lines from crosses of Thatcher x RL6077 and RL6058 (Thatcher*6/PI58548) x RL6077 showed highly significant associations between introgressed markers (including SSR marker cfd71) and leaf rust resistance. In a separate RL6077-derived population, APR to stripe rust was also tightly linked with cfd71 on chromosome 4DL. An allele survey of linked SSR markers cfd71 and cfd23 on a set of 247 wheat lines from diverse origins indicated that these markers can be used to select for the donor segment in most wheat backgrounds. Comparison of RL6077 with Thatcher in field trials showed no effect of the APR gene on important agronomic or quality traits. Since no other known Lr genes exist on chromosome 4DL, the APR gene in RL6077 has been assigned the name Lr67.

AB A new CMS system designated as 'msH1' has been reported in bread wheat using the cytoplasm of H. chilense. While testing this system in different wheat backgrounds, a highly fertile line with chromosome number 42 plus an extra acrocentric chromosome was obtained. The extra chromosome did not pair with any wheat chromosome at meiosis, and progeny from this line which lack the acrocentric chromosome showed pollen abortion and male sterility. In order to establish the origin of this chromosome, FISH using H. chilense genomic DNA as probe was used and showed that it had originated from H. chilense chromosome(s). The novel chromosome did not possess sequences similar to wheat rDNA; however, the probe pSc119.2 from S. cereale containing the 120 bp family was found to occur at the end of its long arm. Data obtained from FISH and EST molecular markers confirm that the long arm of the acrocentric chromosome is indeed, the short arm of chromosome 1H(ch) from H. chilense. We suggest that the novel chromosome originated from a deletion of the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 1H(ch). Neither the 1H(ch)S short arm, nor the whole chromosome 1H(ch) restores pollen fertility of the alloplasmic wheat. Therefore, the restorer gene on the acrocentric chromosome must be located on the retained segment from the hypothetical 1H(ch)L, while some pollen fertility inhibitor could be present on the deleted 1H(ch)L distal segment. Disomic addition of the acrocentric chromosome was obtained and this line resulted fully stable and fertile.

AB Beta vulgaris is a facultative perennial species which exhibits large intraspecific variation in vernalization requirement and includes cultivated biennial forms such as the sugar beet. Vernalization requirement is under the genetic control of the bolting locus B on chromosome II. Previously, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of an annual accession had yielded several mutants which require vernalization to bolt and behave as biennials. Here, five F2 populations derived from crosses between biennial mutants and annual beets were tested for co-segregation of bolting phenotypes with genotypic markers located at the B locus. One mutant appears to be mutated at the B locus, suggesting that an EMS-induced mutation of B can be sufficient to abolish annual bolting. Co-segregation analysis in four populations indicates that the genetic control of bolting also involves previously unknown major loci not linked to B, one of which also affects bolting time and was genetically mapped to chromosome IX.

AB In this study, we report results of the detection and analysis of SSR markers derived of cacao-Moniliophthora perniciosa expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in relation to cacao resistance to witches' broom disease (WBD), and we compare the polymorphism of those ESTs (EST-simple sequence repeat (SSR)) with classical neutral SSR markers. A total of 3,487 ESTs was used in this investigation. SSRs were identified in 430 sequences: 277 from the resistant genotype TSH 1188 and 153 from the susceptible one Catongo, totalizing 505 EST-SSRs with three types of motifs: dinucleotides (72.1%), trinucleotides (27.3%), and tetranucleotides (0.6%). EST-SSRs were classified into 16 main categories; most of the EST-SSRs belonged to "Unknown function" and "No homology" categories (45.82%). A high frequency of SSRs was found in the 5'UTR and in the ORF (about 27%) and a low frequency was observed in the 3'UTR (about 8%). Forty-nine EST-SSR primers were designed and evaluated in 21 cacao accessions, 12 revealed polymorphism, having 47 alleles in total, with an average of 3.92 alleles per locus. On the other hand, the 11 genomic SSR markers revealed a total of 47 alleles, with an average of 5.22 alleles per locus. The association of EST-SSR with the genomic SSR enhanced the analysis of genetic distance among the genotypes. Among the 12 polymorphic EST-SSR markers, two were mapped on the F(2) Sca 6 x ICS 1 population reference for WBD resistance.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Psi), is one of the most damaging diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat variety PIW138 introduced from Pakistan is resistant to the currently prevailing Psi race CYR32 in China. In this study, the bulked segregant analysis (BSA) method and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the stripe rust resistance gene in PIW138. The resistant and susceptible DNA bulks were prepared from the segregating F(2) population of the cross between Thatcher, a susceptible variety as the female parent, and PIW138 as the male parent. The segregation of resistant and susceptible F, plants inoculated with CYR32 indicated that single dominant gene determined the reactions of PIW138 line and temporarily designated as YrP138. Total 200 SSR primers were screened, and 4 SSR markers, Xwmc52, Xbarc61, Xgwm268, and Xgwm153, on chromosome 1B were found to be polymorphic between the resistant and the susceptible DNA bulks as well as their parents. Genetic linkage was tested on the segregating F2 population with 259 plants, including 196 resistant and 63 susceptible plants. All 4 SSR markers were linked to the stripe rust resistance gene in PIW138. The genetic distances of Xwmc52, Xbarc61, Xgwm268, and Xgwm153 to the resistance gene were 29.8, 6.2, 6.8, and 8.2 cM, respectively.

AB Because of the huge morphological variations exhibited there, the Abyssinian Highlands (Ethiopia) are thought of as the secondary center of diversity of domesticated emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum L.). The genetic diversity in 88 domesticated,emmer wheat accessions from Ethiopia and other regions was analyzed using DNA sequences of parts of four genes, Acc1-A, Pgk1-B, Waxy-A and Waxy-B, which are single-copy genes in nuclear DNA. The multilocus genotypes determined by analysis using Structure enabled the 88 accessions to be divided into four clusters. Each cluster included both hulled and free-threshing subspecies, and there was no clustering corresponding to specific subspecies. Both hulled and free-threshing emmer landraces in Ethiopia had several characteristic alleles, and the gene flow between them was shown to be limited. The genetic composition of Ethiopian landraces differed from that of emmer in other regions of the world. However, their nucleotide diversity was not as high as that of other emmer populations. The large morphological diversity in Ethiopian emmer landraces must have evolved from a limited genetic background.

AB Among the progenies of crossing Triticum turgidum - Haynaldia villosa amphiploid with synthetic hexaploid wheat (T. carthlicum / Aegilops tauschii) Am3, two lines (SN030713 and SN05078), with good resistance to stripe rust and powdery mildew, were developed. Cytological studies demonstrated that SN030713 contained 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. SN05078 contained 28 chromosomes and formed 14 bivalents. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis using H. villosa V genomic DNA as the probe showed SN030713 and SN05078 had no large H. villosa chromosome fragments. PCR analysis with H. villosa specific primer pHv29 showed that H. villosa genetic materials were introgressed in these two lines. SSR analysis indicated that the genomic composition of SN030713 was 2n = 6x = 42 (AABBDD), and SN05078 was 2n = 4x = 28 (AABB). Introgressed Ae. tauschii genetic materials in SN05078 were also detected.

AB Chromosomal distribution of the Fat element that was isolated from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences of wheat chromosome 3B was studied in 45 species representing eight genera of Poaceae (Aegilops, Triticum, Agropyron, Elymus, Secale, Hordeum, Avena and Triticale) using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). The Fat sequence was not present in oats and in two barley species, Hordeum vulgare and Hordeum spontaneum, that we investigated. Only very low amounts of the Fat element were detected on the chromosomes of two other barley species, Hordeum geniculatum and Hordeum chilense, with different genome compositions. The chromosomes of other cereal species exhibited distinct hybridisation patterns with the Fat probe, and labelling intensity varied significantly depending on the species or genome. The highest amount of hybridisation was detected on chromosomes of the D genome of Aegilops and Triticum and on chromosomes of the S genome of Agropyron. Despite the bioinformatics analysis of several BAC clones that revealed the tandem organisation of the Fat element, hybridisation with the Fat probe produces uneven, diffuse signals in the proximal regions of chromosomes. In some of the genomes we investigated, however, it also forms distinct, sharp clusters in chromosome-specific positions, and the brightest fluorescence was always observed on group 4 chromosomes. Thus, the Fat element represents a new family of Triticeae-specific, highly repeated DNA elements with a clustered-dispersed distribution pattern. These elements may have first emerged in cereal genomes at the time of divergence of the genus Hordeum from the last common ancestor. During subsequent evolution, the amount and chromosomal distribution of the Fat element changed due to amplification, elimination and re-distribution of this sequence. Because the labelling patterns that we detected were highly specific, the Fat element can be used as an accessory probe in FISH analysis for chromosome identification and investigation of evolutionary processes at the chromosomal level.

AB Over 70% of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars grown worldwide have a semidwarf phenotype controlled by the major genes Rht-B1, Rht-D1, and Rht8c. The objective of this study was to determine their frequency in a set of historic and modern soft and hard winter wheat cultivars grown in the central and eastern USA. Three hundred sixty-two cultivars that were developed from 1808 to 2008 were evaluated with molecular markers for Rht-B1, Rht-D1, and Rht8c. All cultivars released before 1964 (41 soft winter wheat and 6 hard winter wheat) had wildtype (tall) alleles at all three loci. After introduction of the dwarfing genes, the percentage of tested lines carrying either Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b increased rapidly to greater than 90% of modern varieties. Among soft winter wheat cultivars, the Rht-D1b dwarfing gene was the most frequent being present in 45% of all lines tested and Rht-B1b was present in 28%, while in the hard winter wheat cultivars the Rht-B1b allele is the most prevalent in 77% of lines. Only 8% of the hard cultivars tested had the Rht-D1b allele. The presence of the 192-base pair (bp) allele of the microsatellite marker Xgwm261 indicated that Rht8c was less frequently used as a source of dwarfing in U.S. winter wheat germplasm, being present in 8 and 3% of the soft winter wheat and the hard winter wheats, respectively. A number of modern cultivars were identified that did not carry any of the dwarfing genes assayed and may possess alternative reduced height genes.

AB The wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr22 confers resistance to Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Pers. race TTKSK (also known as Ug99) that developed in Africa and is an immediate threat to world wheat production. The resistance gene is present on a chromosomal translocation derived from Triticum boeoticum Boiss., which has a genome that is partially homologous to the A genome of T aestivum L. Sr22 has been deployed in a limited number of cultivars due to poor agronomic performance of lines carrying the resistance gene. Linkage analysis of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on chromosome 7A was performed to identify loci closely linked to Sr22. The most tightly linked proximal and distal SSR marker loci were Xcfa2123 and Xwmc633, respectively. A two-step process was then used to develop resistant lines having smaller chromosome segments derived from the diploid donor. First, individuals in which a single recombination event had occurred between wheat and the Sr22 introgression were identified in the mapping populations. In spite of reduced recombination between T boeoticum and T aestivum chromosomes, sufficient recombination events were found among 398 F(3:4) lines derived from recombinant F(2) progeny to recover multiple resistant individuals with smaller alien introgressions. Resistant lines were identified having less than 6% of the chromosome arm derived from T boeoticum. These lines may provide a more agronomically desirable source of Sr22 that can be readily deployed in cultivars resistant to Ug99.

AB The wheat (Triticum aestivum L. and T turgidum L.) stem rust resistance gene Sr6 confers a high level of resistance against a wide range of races of Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn. in North America. In this study, we report the identification of flanking markers for Sr6. We used a population of 139 recombinant inbred lines from the cross MN99394 x MN98550. A partial linkage map of chromosome 2D comprised Xgwm484, Xcfd77, Xcfd43, Xwmc453, Sr6, XwPt_4381, XwPt_0330, Xgpw94049, and Xgwm102. Four markers mapped distal to Sr6, while the other four were proximal within distances of 4.8 and 6.5 cM, respectively. Marker-assisted selection and pyramiding of Sr6 with other stem rust resistance genes could benefit from the availability of Sr6-flanking markers.

AB Plant geneticists consider molecular marker assisted selection a useful additional tool in plant breeding programs to make selection more efficient. Standards for organic agriculture do not exclude the use of molecular markers as such, however for the organic sector the appropriateness of molecular markers is not self-evident and is often debated. Organic and low-input farming conditions require breeding for robust and flexible varieties, which may be hampered by too much focus on the molecular level. Pros and contras for application of molecular markers in breeding for organic agriculture was the topic of a recent European plant breeding workshop. The participants evaluated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the use of molecular markers and we formalized their inputs into breeder's perspectives and perspectives seen from the organic sector's standpoint. Clear strengths were identified, e.g. better knowledge about gene pool of breeding material, more efficient introgression of new resistance genes from wild relatives and testing pyramided genes. There were also common concerns among breeders aiming at breeding for organic and/or conventional agriculture, such as the increasing competition and cost investments to get access to marker technology, and the need for bridging the gap between phenotyping and genotyping especially with complex and quantitative inherited traits such as nutrient-efficiency. A major conclusion of the authors is that more interaction and mutual understanding between organic and molecular oriented breeders is necessary and can benefit both research communities.

AB A quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to pea rust, caused by the fungus Uromyces pisi (Pers.) Wint., has been identified in a F(2) population derived from an intraspecific cross between two wild pea (Pisum fulvum L.) accessions, IFPI3260 (resistant) and IFPI3251 (susceptible). Both parental lines and all the segregating population displayed a fully compatible interaction (high infection type), which indicates absence of hypersensitive response. Nevertheless, differences on the percentage of symptomatic area of the whole plant (disease severity) were observed. A genetic map was developed covering 1283.3 cM and including 146 markers (144 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) and two sequence tagged sites (STSs) markers) distributed in 9 linkage groups. A QTL explaining 63% of the total phenotypic variation was located in linkage group 3. RAPDs markers (OPY11(1316) and OPV17(1078)) flanking this QTL should allow, after their conversion in SCARs, a reliable marker-assisted selection for rust resistance.

AB A monoclonal antibody was raised with specificity for the granule bound starch synthase (GBSS1) Wx-B1 homeoallele of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) using a synthetic peptide immunogen. This was used to develop a simplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the discrimination of Wx-B1 a and Wx-B1b alleles which differ in the starch properties they confer. Discrimination of these alleles is important for the selection of wheat lines for Udon-style noodle production. The simplified ELISA worked in a single antibody (indirect) format and gave improved ease of use, discrimination of alleles and resolution relative to a previously developed 2-antibody (sandwich) ELISA. When the test was validated using breeders seed of a panel of commercial cultivars, heterogeneity of Wx-B1 alleles was observed for a significant proportion of the cultivars tested and this was confirmed using PCR analysis of the Wx-B1 and Wx-A1 genes. This observation has implications for cultivar wheat quality assessment, the application of molecular markers for variety identification purposes and the establishment of mapping populations from commercial cultivars.

AB Catecholase activity was studied polarographically in whole seeds and their three laboratory separated components (seed testa, cotyledons and embryo) of Lupinus albus, Lupinus angustifolius, Lupinus luteus and Lupinus polyphyllus. The weight of seeds and their components and hydration varied noticeably between species. The weight of seeds and their components is not visible in catecholase activity. This enzyme was active in whole seeds and their components but with different intensites. The smallest activity across the four species was measured in Lupinus albus and Lupinus polyphyllus and the highest in Lupinus luteus. The smallest values were found in the embryo and the highest in the cotyledons (Lupinus tabus, Lupinus angustifolius and Lupinus luteus) and seed testa (Lupinus polyphyllus). The present results indirectly provide evidence of the protective potential of seed catecholase activity in cells after mechanical destruction of seed cellular structures. The most relevant explanation for the differences in catecholase activity between lupin species would appear to be genetic. The activity of this enzyme can be used as a taxon parameter and gene expression marker, and has possible implications for use in the intensification of germination and in biotechnological and molecular applications of legumes.

AB P>Mycosphaerella graminicola is a major pathogen of wheat worldwide, causing Septoria leaf blotch disease. Targeted gene disruption in M. graminicola, by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, has become an established functional genomics tool for M. graminicola research in recent years. However, in order to advance research into this economically important pathogen, further functional genomics tools need to be developed. Here, we report three new capabilities for M. graminicola research: (i) two selectable markers have been shown to work robustly in M. graminicola, namely G418 and the fungicide carboxin; (ii) the generation of a strain of M. graminicola in which the KU70 (MUS-51) homologue has been disrupted; in this strain, homologous recombination efficiencies increased to more than 95%, whilst maintaining wild-type growth in vitro and full pathogenicity on wheat leaves; (iii) the ability to efficiently target and generate precise mutations of specific genes in the genomic context in M. graminicola. In addition, the insertion of the E198A mutation into the beta-tubulin gene (MgTUB1), conferring resistance to the fungicide benomyl, suggests that this mutant allele may provide an additional selectable marker. The collective use of these tools will permit further advancements in our knowledge of the biology and pathogenicity of this important plant pathogen.

AB There is growing evidence that lesions of the anterior thalamic nuclei cause long-lasting intrinsic changes to retrosplenial cortex, with the potential to alter its functional properties. The present study had two goals. The first was to identify the pattern of changes in eight markers, as measured by in-situ hydridisation, in the granular retrosplenial cortex (area Rgb) following anterior thalamic lesions. The second was to use retrograde trans-neuronal tracing methods to identify the potential repercussions of intrinsic changes within granular retrosplenial cortex. In Experiment 1, adult rats received unilateral lesions of the anterior thalamic nuclei and were perfused 4 weeks later. Of the eight markers, four (c-fos, zif268, 5ht2rc, kcnab2) showed a very similar pattern of change, with decreased levels in superficial retrosplenial cortex (lamina II) in the ipsilateral hemisphere but little or no change in deeper layers (lamina V). A fifth marker (cox6b) showed a shift in activity levels in the opposite direction to the previous four markers. Three other markers (cox6a1, CD74, ncs-1) did not appear to change activity levels after surgery. The predominant pattern of change, a decrease in superficial cortical activity, points to potential alterations in plasticity and metabolism. In Experiment 2, wheat germ agglutin (WGA) was injected into the anterior thalamic nuclei in rats given different survival times, sometimes in combination with the retrograde, fluorescent tracer, Fast Blue. Dense aggregations of retrogradely labeled cells were always found in lamina VI of granular retrosplenial cortex, but additional labeled cells in lamina II were only found: (1) in WGA cases, that is never after Fast Blue injections, and (2) after longer WGA survival times (3 days). These layer II Rgb cells are likely to have been trans-neuronally labeled, revealing a pathway from lamina II of Rgb to those deeper retrosplenial cells that project directly to the anterior thalamic nuclei.

AB P>Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), vectored by Wheat curl mite, has been of great economic importance in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada. Recently, the virus has been identified in Australia, where it has spread quickly to all major wheat growing areas. The difficulties in finding adequate natural resistance in wheat prompted us to develop transgenic resistance based on RNA interference (RNAi). An RNAi construct was designed to target the nuclear inclusion protein 'a' (NIa) gene of WSMV. Wheat was stably cotransformed with two plasmids: pStargate-NIa expressing hairpin RNA (hpRNA) including WSMV sequence and pCMneoSTLS2 with the nptII selectable marker. When T(1) progeny were assayed against WSMV, ten of sixteen families showed complete resistance in transgenic segregants. The resistance was classified as immunity by four criteria: no disease symptoms were produced; ELISA readings were as in uninoculated plants; viral sequences could not be detected by RT-PCR from leaf extracts; and leaf extracts failed to give infections in susceptible plants when used in test-inoculation experiments. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated hpRNA transgene integrated into the wheat genome. Moreover, accumulation of small RNAs derived from the hpRNA transgene sequence positively correlated with immunity. We also showed that the selectable marker gene nptII segregated independently of the hpRNA transgene in some transgenics, and therefore demonstrated that it is possible using these techniques, to produce marker-free WSMV immune transgenic plants. This is the first report of immunity in wheat to WSMV using a spliceable intron hpRNA strategy.

DT Article
AB Information on genetic diversity and population structure of elite wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding lines promotes effective use of genetic resources. We analyzed 205 elite wheat breeding lines from major winter wheat breeding programs in the USA using 245 markers across the wheat genomes. This collection showed a high level of genetic diversity as reflected by allele number per locus (7.2) and polymorphism information content (0.54). However, the diversity of U. S. modern wheat appeared to be lower than previously reported diversity levels in worldwide germplasm collections. As expected, this collection was highly structured according to geographic origin and market class with soft and hard wheat clearly separated from each other. Hard wheat accessions were further divided into three subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was primarily distributed around centromere regions. The mean genome-wide LD decay estimate was 10 cM (r(2) > 0.1), although the extent of LD was highly variable throughout the genome. Our results on genetic diversity of different gene pools and the distribution of LD facilitates the effective use of genetic resources for wheat breeding and the choice of marker density in gene mapping and marker-assisted breeding.

AB Wheat production in Pakistan is seriously constrained due to rust diseases and stripe rust (yellow) caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, which could limit yields. Thus development and cultivation of genetically diverse and resistant varieties is the most sustainable solution to overcome these diseases. The first objective of the present study was to evaluate 100 Pakistan wheat cultivars that have been grown over the past 60 years. These cultivars were inoculated at the seedling stage with two virulent stripe rust isolates from the United States and two from Pakistan. None of the wheat cultivars were resistant to all tested stripe rust isolates, and 16% of cultivars were susceptible to the four isolates at the seedling stage. The data indicated that none of the Pakistan wheat cultivars contained either Yr5 or Yr15 genes that were considered to be effective against most P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates from around the world. Several Pakistan wheat cultivars may have gene Yr10, which is effective against isolate PST-127 but ineffective against PST-116. It is also possible that these cultivars may have other previously unidentified genes or gene combinations. The second objective was to evaluate the 100 Pakistan wheat cultivars for stripe rust resistance during natural epidemics in Pakistan and Washington State, USA. It was found that a higher frequency of resistance was present under field conditions compared with greenhouse conditions. Thirty genotypes (30% of germplasms) were found to have a potentially high temperature adult plant (HTAP) resistance. The third objective was to determine the genetic diversity in Pakistan wheat germplasms using molecular markers. This study was based on DNA fingerprinting using resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) marker analysis. The highest polymorphism detected with RGAP primer pairs was 40%, 50% and 57% with a mean polymorphism of 36%. A total of 22 RGAP markers were obtained in this study. RGAP, simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers were used to determine the presence and absence of some important stripe rust resistance genes, such as Yr5, Yr8, Yr9, Yr15 and Yr18. Of the 60 cultivars analyzed, 17% of cultivars showed a RGAP marker band for Yr9 and 12% of cultivars exhibited the Yr18 marker band. No marker band was detected for Yr5, Yr8 and Yr15, indicating a likely absence of these genes in the tested Pakistan wheat cultivars. Cluster analysis based on molecular and stripe rust reaction data is useful in identifying considerable genetic diversity among Pakistan wheat cultivars. The resistant germplasms identified with 22 RGAP markers and from the resistance evaluations should be useful in developing new wheat cultivars with stripe rust resistance.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) are two wheat diseases caused by the same Fusarium pathogens. Progress towards CR resistance could benefit from FHB-resistant germplasm if the same genes are involved in resistance to these two different diseases. Two independent studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between host resistances to these two diseases. In the first study 32 genotypes were assessed and no significant correlation between their reactions to FHB and CR was detected. The second study was based on a QTL analysis of a doubled haploid population derived from a variety with resistance to both diseases. Results from this study showed that loci conferring resistance to FHB and CR are located on different chromosomes. Together, these results suggest that, despite a common aetiology, different host genes are involved in the resistance against FHB and CR in wheat. Thus, although it is possible that genes affecting both diseases may exist in other germplasm or under different conditions, separate screening seems to be needed in identifying sources of CR resistance.

AB Thinopyrum intermedium translocations derived from the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) substitution line P-29 were previously characterized by RFLP. We have further analyzed these lines and additional related germplasm with publicly available STS and SSRs. Primers which showed a polymorphism between wheat and P-29, were tested in all recombinant and nulli-tetrasomic lines confirming their position on chromosome 7D. The resulting 7D/7E chromosome maps appeared as a mosaic of wheat and Th. intermedium chromatin sections. To verify the composition of the translocation lines suggested by the RFLP-PCR map, F(2) progeny of two crosses (CS/216-1 and CS/260-1) were analyzed with molecular markers. Both populations gave an unexpectedly diverse number of recombinant individuals, suggesting that interstitial translocations occur more frequently than previously thought. This analysis also showed that there is a wide range in the number and position of the interstitial translocations within a given line such as the mosaic chromosome in recombinant line 260-1/CS-26, which has four Th. intermedium chromosome segments. Phenotypic data of the two populations suggested the presence of one gene which we have called Bdv3 to differentiate it from the previously reported orthologous gene Bdv2. Using the PCR-based molecular markers identified in this study, 5 out of 12 elite lines that showed good yields and no YDV symptoms contained Th. intermedium chromatin. Due to the multiple components involved in the YDV disease complex, combining selection for YDV resistance with the molecular markers and maps identified in this study will increase the efficiency of introgressing Th. intermedium chromatin containing YDV resistance or other beneficial traits into elite wheat germplasm.

AB Charles Darwin began The Origin of Species with a chapter entitled variation under domestication, which encapsulated decades of his research on a diverse array of animal and plant domesticated species. Variation in these species compared with that in their wild relatives, their origins and their selection by humans, formed a paradigm for his theory of the evolutionary origin of species by means of natural selection. This chapter, its subsequent expansion into a two-volume monograph, together with the rediscovery of Mendel's laws, later became the foundation of scientific plant breeding. In the period up to the present, several advances in genetics (such as artificial mutation, polyploidy, adaptation and genetic markers) have amplified the discipline with concepts and questions, the seeds of which are in Darwin's original words. Today, we are witnessing a flowering of genomic research into the process of domestication itself, particularly the specific major and minor genes involved. In one striking way, our view of domestic diversity contrasts with that in Darwin's writing. He stressed the abundance of diversity and the diversifying power of artificial selection, whereas we are concerned about dwindling genetic diversity that attends modern agriculture and development. In this context, it is paramount to strive for a deeper understanding of how farmer selection including both deliberate selection and unconscious selection, might generate and retain diversity. This knowledge is essential for devising in situ conservation measures.

AB Colonization of sorghum and wheat after seed inoculation with Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus strains PAL 5 and UAP 5541/pRGS561 (containing the marker gene gusA) was studied by colony counting and microscopic observation of plant tissues. Inoculum levels as low as 10(2) CFU per seed were enough for root colonization and further spreading in aerial tissues. Rhizoplane colonization was around 7 log CFU g(-1) (fresh weight). G. diazotrophicus was found inside sorghum and wheat roots with populations higher than 5 log CFU g(-1) (fresh weight). Stem colonization remained stable for 30 days post inoculation with endophyte concentrations from 4 to 5 log CFU g(-1) (fresh weight) (in both plants). Population in leaves decreased continuously being undetectable after 17 days post inoculation.

AB Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Russian wheat aphid) has severe economic impacts on wheat and barley production in the United States. The interaction between the Russian wheat aphid and its cereal hosts is poorly understood. However, the recent appearance of new biotypes in the United States showed that specific interactions exist between wheat resistance loci and Russian wheat aphid biotypes. At present, Dn 7 is the only known gene in hexaploid wheat that confers resistance against all U.S. Russian wheat aphid biotypes This study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism of Dn 7-mediated resistance against two U.S. Russian wheat aphid biotypes (Russian wheat aphid 1 and Russian wheat aphid 2). Using GeneChip Wheat Genome Arrays, we compared transcript profiles of resistant and susceptible lines infested with either Russian wheat aphid 1 or Russian wheat aphid 2 using two time intervals (5 and 48 h after infestation). Russian wheat aphid feeding on hexaploid wheat led to the induction of groups of genes functioning in oxidative and general stress, photosynthesis, cell respiration and energy production, signal transduction, calcium-dependent signaling, pathogenesis related (PR) responses, and defense compound synthesis The number of differentially expressed genes was higher in plants infested with Russian wheat aphid 1 compared with those infested with Russian wheat aphid 2. Although most genes involved in basic cellular functions were shared, unique genes were also obtained This finding may indicate subtle differences in genes induced in response to different virulence proteins.

AB The recessive adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr48 in wheat was tagged with flanking random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Markers S336(775) in coupling and S3(450) in repulsion with Lr48 were identified in wheat line CSP44. Tests of these markers on available Thatcher near-isogenic lines (NILs) detected the likely presence of Lr48 in TcLr25. A test of allelism of APR involving the cross TcLr25 x CSP44 indicated that Lr48 was present in both lines. A separate experiment on inheritance of resistance in an F(2) population of TcLr25 x Agra Local confirmed the presence of a dominant seedling resistance gene (Lr25) and a recessive APR gene (Lr48) in TcLr25. This study demonstrated the value of molecular markers in identifying the presence of masked genes in genetic stocks where direct phenotyping failed to detect their presence.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is an important disease for wheat production, both in China and worldwide. In laboratory studies spelt wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) landrace Altgold was resistant to P. triticina races THT and PHT and genetic analysis indicated that it possessed a dominant leaf rust resistance gene, temporarily designated LrAlt. F(6) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross with the susceptible common wheat cultivar Nongda 3338 were used to map LrAlt with SSR markers. The resistance gene was distal to SSR loci Xbarc212, Xwmc382, Xgwm636, and Xwmc407 on the short arm of chromosome 2A. The closest markers Xbarc212 and Xwmc382 which co-segregated were 1.8 cM away from LrAlt. The relationships of LrAlt and other wheat leaf rust resistance genes located on the short arm of chromosome 2A were discussed, suggesting that LrAlt might be a new leaf rust resistance gene.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) spikes is stimulated by cool and wet weather and leads to a decline in grain quality. A low level of harvest-time seed dormancy is a major factor for PHS, which generally is a larger problem in white-grained as compared to red-grained wheat. We have in this study analyzed seed dormancy levels at the 92nd Zadok growth stage of spike development in a doubled-haploid (DH) white wheat population and associated variation for the trait with regions on the wheat genome. The phenotypic data was generated by growing the parent lines Argent (non-dormant) and W98616 (dormant) and 151 lines of the DH population in the field during 2002 and 2003, at two locations each year, followed by assessment of harvest-time seed dormancy by germination tests. A genetic map of 2681 cM was constructed for the population upon genotyping 90 DH lines using 361 SSR, 292 AFLP, 252 DArT and 10 EST markers. Single marker analysis of the 90 genotyped lines associated regions on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 3A, 4A, 5B, 6B, and 7A with seed dormancy in at least two out of the four trials. All seven putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were contributed by alleles of the dormant parent, W98616. The strongest QTLs positioned on chromosomes 1A, 3A, 4A and 7A were confirmed by interval mapping and markers at these loci have potential use in marker-assisted selection of PHS resistant white-grained wheat.

AB Large number of well-filled grains per panicle is an important yield component trait in rice. A combination of QTL mapping and transcriptome profiling was used to identify candidate genes for grain number. A framework linkage map was constructed using 166 SSR markers evenly distributed over the 12 rice chromosomes. QTL mapping using 3 years phenotyping data on a set of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Pusa 1266 (high grain number) and Pusa Basmati 1 (low grain number) identified one consistent QTL qGN4-1 on the long arm of chromosome 4 with major effect on grain number. This QTL was co-localized with major QTLs for primary and secondary branches per panicle, and number of panicles per plant. The QTL interval was narrowed down to 11.1 cM (0.78 Mbp) by targeted enrichment of the region with six additional markers. Microarray transcriptome profiling revealed eight genes in the qGN4-1 region differentially expressed between the two parents during early panicle development. Synteny of this QTL and potential candidates was examined in wheat, barley, maize, sorghum, and Brachypodium to further validate the association.

AB Aims:
   To assess the applicability of sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers obtained from BOX, ERIC and RAPD fragments to design primers for real-time PCR quantification of the phytostimulatory maize inoculants Azospirillum brasilense UAP-154 and CFN-535 in the rhizosphere.
   Methods and Results:
   Primers were designed based on strain-specific SCAR markers and were screened for successful amplification of target strain and absence of cross-reaction with other Azospirillum strains. The specificity of primers thus selected was verified under real-time PCR conditions using genomic DNA from strain collection and DNA from rhizosphere samples. The detection limit was 60 fg DNA with pure cultures and 4 x 103 (for UAP-154) and 4 x 104 CFU g-1 (for CFN-535) in the maize rhizosphere. Inoculant quantification was effective from 104 to 108 CFU g-1 soil.
   Conclusion:
   BOX-based SCAR markers were useful to find primers for strain-specific real-time PCR quantification of each A. brasilense inoculant in the maize rhizosphere.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   Effective root colonization is a prerequisite for successful Azospirillum phytostimulation, but cultivation-independent monitoring methods were lacking. The real-time PCR methods developed here will help understand the effect of environmental conditions on root colonization and phytostimulation by A. brasilense UAP-154 and CFN-535.

AB Detection and utilization of genetic variation available in the germplasm collection for crop improvement have been the prime activities of breeders. Here a set of ICARDA barley germplasm collection comprising of 185 cultivated (Hordeum vulgare L.) and 38 wild (H. spontaneum L.) genotypes originated from 30 countries of four continents was genotyped with 68 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 45 microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from genes (expressed sequence tags, ESTs). As two SNP markers provided 2 and 3 datapoints, a total of 71 SNPs were surveyed that yielded a total of 143 alleles. The number of SSR alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 22 with an average of 7.9 per marker. Average PIC (polymorphism information content) value for SSR and SNP markers were recorded as 0.63 and 0.38, respectively. Heterogeneity was recorded at both SNP and SSR loci in an average of 5.72 and 12.42% accessions, respectively. Genetic similarity matrices for SSR and SNP allelic data were highly correlated (r = 0.75, P < 0.005) and therefore allelic data for both markers were combined and analyzed for understanding the genetic relationships among the germplasm surveyed. Majority of clusters/subclusters were found to contain genotypes from the same geographic origins. While comparing the genetic diversity, the accessions coming from Middle East Asia and North East Asia showed more diversity as compared to that of other geographic regions. Majority of countries representing Africa, Middle East Asia, North East Asia and Arabian Peninsula included the genotypes that contained rare alleles. As expected, spontaneum accessions, as compared to vulgare accessions, showed a higher number of total alleles, higher number of alleles per locus, higher effective number of alleles and higher allelic richness and a higher number of rare alleles were observed. In summary, the examined ICARDA germplasm set showed ample natural genetic variation that can be harnessed for future breeding of barley as climate change and sustainability have become important throughout all growing areas of the world, drought/heat tolerance being the most important ones.

AB P>Evolving high yielding rice genotypes with durable resistance to bacterial leaf blight (BLB) is pertinent considering the extensive damage caused by the disease in most of the rice growing regions. Two high yielding BLB susceptible indica rice cultivars, 'ADT43' and 'ASD16' popular among farmers and consumers across South India have been introgressed with three BLB resistance genes xa5, xa13 and Xa21 from isoline IRBB60 using functional markers. The F(2) populations of 500 plants from ADT43 x IRBB60 and 806 plants from ASD16 x IRBB60 crosses were screened for the presence of all the three resistance genes. Thirty genotypes with three genes in homozygous and 55 genotypes with two genes in homozygous and one gene in heterozygous condition were identified. These pyramided genotypes with two or three resistance genes exhibited high levels of resistance against two predominant Xanthomonas oryzae isolates of South India. Among the 30 pyramided genotypes (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21), 12 were found to be significantly high yielding with desirable agronomic characteristics and the selection efficiency of the present markers was hundred percent.

AB The genetic and physiological mechanisms of aluminum (Al) tolerance have been well studied in certain cereal crops, and Al tolerance genes have been identified in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Rice (Oryza sativa) has been reported to be highly Al tolerant; however, a direct comparison of rice and other cereals has not been reported, and the mechanisms of rice Al tolerance are poorly understood. To facilitate Al tolerance phenotyping in rice, a high-throughput imaging system and root quantification computer program was developed, permitting quantification of the entire root system, rather than just the longest root. Additionally, a novel hydroponic solution was developed and optimized for Al tolerance screening in rice and compared with the Yoshida's rice solution commonly used for rice Al tolerance studies. To gain a better understanding of Al tolerance in cereals, comparisons of Al tolerance across cereal species were conducted at four Al concentrations using seven to nine genetically diverse genotypes of wheat, maize (Zea mays), sorghum, and rice. Rice was significantly more tolerant than maize, wheat, and sorghum at all Al concentrations, with the mean Al tolerance level for rice found to be 2- to 6-fold greater than that in maize, wheat, and sorghum. Physiological experiments were conducted on a genetically diverse panel of more than 20 rice genotypes spanning the range of rice Al tolerance and compared with two maize genotypes to determine if rice utilizes the well-described Al tolerance mechanism of root tip Al exclusion mediated by organic acid exudation. These results clearly demonstrate that the extremely high levels of rice Al tolerance are mediated by a novel mechanism, which is independent of root tip Al exclusion.

AB Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14, JJ or E(b)E(b)) is an important genetic resource for wheat improvement due to its salinity tolerance and disease resistance. Development of wheat-Th. bessarabicum translocation lines will facilitate its practical utilization in wheat improvement. In this study, a novel wheat-Th. bessarabicum translocation line T2JS-2BS center dot 2BL, which carries a segment of Th. bessarabicum chromosome arm 2JS was identified and further characterized using sequential chromosome C-banding, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and DNA markers. The translocation breakpoint was mapped within bin C-2BS1-0.53 of chromosome 2B through marker analysis. Compared to the Chinese Spring (CS) parent and to CS-type lines, the translocation line has more fertile spikes per plant, longer spikes, more grains per spike and higher yield per plant, which suggests that the alien segment carries yield-related genes. However, plants with the translocation are also taller, head later and have lower 1,000-kernel weight than CS or CS-type lines. By using markers specific to the barley photoperiod response gene Ppd-H1, it was determined that the late heading date was conferred by a recessive allele located on the 2JS segment. In addition, four markers specific for the translocated segment were identified, which can be used for marker-aided screening.

AB Responsiveness to abscisic acid (ABA) during vegetative growth plays an important role in regulating adaptive responses to various environmental conditions, including activation of a number of ABA-responsive genes. However, the relationship between gene expression and responsiveness to ABA at the seedling stage has not been well studied in wheat. In the present study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for ABA responsiveness at the seedling stage was performed using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between common wheat cultivars showing different ABA responsiveness. Five QTLs were found to be significant, located on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 3A, 6D and 7B. The QTL with the greatest effect was located on chromosome 6D and explained 11.12% of the variance in ABA responsiveness. The other QTLs each accounted for approximately 5-8% of the phenotypic variation. Expression analyses of three ABA-responsive Cor/Lea genes, Wdhn13, Wrab15 and Wrab17, showed that allelic differences in QTLs on chromosomes 2A, 6D and 7B influenced expression of these genes in seedlings treated with ABA. The 3A QTL appeared to be involved in the regulatory system of Wdhn13 and Wrab15, but not Wrab17. The effects of the 2A and 6D QTLs on gene expression were relatively large. The combination of alleles at the QTLs resulted in an additive or synergistic effect on Cor/Lea expression. These results indicate that the QTLs influencing ABA responsiveness are associated with ABA-regulated gene expression and suggest that the QTL on chromosome 6D with the largest effect acts as a key regulator of ABA responses including seedling growth arrest and gene expression during the vegetative stage.

AB Kernel characteristics, particularly kernel weight, kernel size, and grain protein content, are important components of grain yield and quality in wheat. Development of high performing wheat cultivars, with high grain yield and quality, is a major focus in wheat breeding programs worldwide. Here, we report chromosome regions harboring genes that influence kernel weight, kernel diameter, kernel size distribution, grain protein content, and grain yield in hard red spring wheat breeding lines adapted to the Upper Midwest region of the United States. A genetic linkage map composed of 531 SSR and DArT marker loci spanned a distance of 2,505 cM, covering all 21 chromosomes of wheat. Stable QTL clusters influencing kernel weight, kernel diameter, and kernel size distribution were identified on chromosomes 2A, 5B, and 7A. Phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL at these clusters varied from 5 to 20% depending on the trait. A QTL region on chromosome 2B confers an undesirable pleiotropic effect or a repulsion linkage between grain yield (LOD = 6.7; R (2) = 18%) and grain protein content (LOD = 6.2; R (2) = 13.3%). However, several grain protein and grain yield QTL independent of each other were also identified. Because some of the QTL identified in this study were consistent across environments, DNA markers will provide an opportunity for increasing the frequency of desirable alleles through marker-assisted selection.

AB Background: The introduction of transgenes into plants may cause unintended phenotypic effects which could have an impact on the plant itself and the environment. Little is published in the scientific literature about the interrelation of environmental factors and possible unintended effects in genetically modified (GM) plants.
   Methods and Findings: We studied transgenic bread wheat Triticum aestivum lines expressing the wheat Pm3b gene against the fungus powdery mildew Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici. Four independent offspring pairs, each consisting of a GM line and its corresponding non-GM control line, were grown under different soil nutrient conditions and with and without fungicide treatment in the glasshouse. Furthermore, we performed a field experiment with a similar design to validate our glasshouse results. The transgene increased the resistance to powdery mildew in all environments. However, GM plants reacted sensitive to fungicide spraying in the glasshouse. Without fungicide treatment, in the glasshouse GM lines had increased vegetative biomass and seed number and a twofold yield compared with control lines. In the field these results were reversed. Fertilization generally increased GM/control differences in the glasshouse but not in the field. Two of four GM lines showed up to 56% yield reduction and a 40-fold increase of infection with ergot disease Claviceps purpurea compared with their control lines in the field experiment; one GM line was very similar to its control.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that, depending on the insertion event, a particular transgene can have large effects on the entire phenotype of a plant and that these effects can sometimes be reversed when plants are moved from the glasshouse to the field. However, it remains unclear which mechanisms underlie these effects and how they may affect concepts in molecular plant breeding and plant evolutionary ecology.

AB Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] is an important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Host resistance conferred by H genes has been the most effective means to manage Hessian fly populations. More than 32 H genes have been identified in wheat and its relatives. In a previous study, Hessian fly-resistance gene H32 was assigned to the chromosomal bin 3DL3-0.81-1.00, which also harbors H26 The objectives of this study were to develop and validate sequence-tagged site (STS) markers closely linked to H32 and to determine the genetic relationship between H26 and H32. In this study, 11 wheat EST-derived STS markers linked to H26 and three new STS markers were added to the linkage map of H32 using the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) population. Two of the STS markers, Xrwgs10 and Xrwgs12, were found to flank H32 with a genetic distance of 0.5 cM. Another STS marker Xrwgs11, co-segregated with H32 Molecular markers tightly linked to H32 were validated in 12 bread wheat cultivars and an elite breeding line, demonstrating the efficacy of these markers for marker-assisted selection. Comparative mapping analysis indicated that H26 and H32 are either different alleles at the same gene locus or two different, but tightly linked H genes. Ongoing efforts to perform fine mapping and positional cloning of H26 will resolve the relationship between H26 and H32.

AB The stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f.sp. tritici Eriks. and Henn.) resistance gene Sr39, which confers resistance to TTKSK (Ug99), has been incorporated into the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome from Aegilops speltoides in the form of a chromosome translocation but it has not been deployed into adapted cultivars. In this study, we characterized translocation lines carrying Sr39 in four different wheat backgrounds with fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The results indicated that RL5711 and RL6082 had translocation chromosomes of comparable structure. The translocation chromosome in PI 600683 has lost Ae speltoides chromatin in the telomeric end of the 2S long arm. Six translocation lines derived from the cross PI 600683/3*HY438 had translocation chromosomes of comparable structure to the one found in PI 600683. However, one line (P9714-AM03C51), showed a substantial reduction in Ae. speltoides chromatin in the short arm of the translocated chromosome. The study demonstrated that it is apparently feasible to shorten Ae. speltoides chromatin in some wheat-Ae. speltoides translocation lines. These results and the identification of diagnostic SSR markers will be useful in guiding chromosome manipulation efforts to further shorten the Ae. speltordes chromosome segments in these materials. Greenhouse inoculation of translocation lines with stem rust indicated that the Sr39 gene conditions resistance to at least seven stem rust races.

AB Jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host) with CCDD genomes is a noxious weed of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Wheat (BBAADD) and jointed goatgrass (JGG) can hybridize under natural conditions, leading to a possibility of gene flow between these two species. For a gene to move from herbicide-resistant wheat to JGG, JGG must be the recurrent parent in a series (two) of backcrosses. One way of determining the pollen parent in the first backcross is to visualize C-genome chromosomes using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). By using GISH it was determined that 7 of 88 (8%) BC(1) plants had more than seven C-genome chromosomes, indicating that JGG was the pollen parent. By using wheat-specific chloroplast simple sequence repeat marker (WCt-3) analysis, 13.6% of the hybrids had wheat as the female parent, while the remaining plants had JGG as the female parent. This study presents a reliable way of determining the pollen parent of BC(1) progeny and the hybridization dynamics between wheat and jointed goatgrass under natural field conditions This information can be used to more accurately predict the risk for gene migration between wheat and jointed goatgrass.

AB In annual plant species, flowering time is a major adaptive trait that synchronizes the initiation of reproduction with favorable environmental conditions. Here, we aimed at studying the evolution of flowering time in three experimental populations of bread wheat, grown in contrasting environments (Northern to Southern France) for 12 generations. By comparing the distribution of phenotypic and presumably neutral variation, we first showed that flowering time responded to selection during the 12 generations of the experiment. To get insight into the genetic architecture of that trait, we then tested whether the distribution of genetic polymorphisms at six candidate genes, presumably involved in the trait expression, departed from neutral expectation. To that end, we focused on the temporal variation during the course of the experiment, and on the spatial differentiation at the end of the experiment, using previously published methods adapted to our experimental design. Only those genes that were strongly associated with flowering time variation were detected as responding to selection. For genes that had low-to-moderate phenotypic effects, or when there was interaction across different genes, we did not find evidence of selection using methods based on the distribution of temporal or spatial variation. In such cases, it might be more informative to consider multilocus and multiallelic combinations across genes, which could be the targets of selection.

AB Unigene sequences available in public databases provide a cost-effective and valuable source for the development of molecular markers. In this study, the identification and development of unigene-based SSR markers in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is presented. A total of 1071 SSRs were identified in 15 740 cowpea unigene sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The most frequent SSR motifs present in the unigenes were trinucleotides (59.7%), followed by dinucleotides (34.8%), pentanucleotides (4%), and tetranucleotides (1.5%). The copy number varied from 6 to 33 for dinucleotide, 5 to 29 for trinucleotide, 5 to 7 for tetranucleotide, and 4 to 6 for pentanucleotide repeats. Primer pairs were successfully designed for 803 SSR motifs and 102 SSR markers were finally characterized and validated. Putative function was assigned to 64.7% of the unigene SSR markers based on significant homology to reported proteins. About 31.7% of the SSRs were present in coding sequences and 68.3% in untranslated regions of the genes. About 87% of the SSRs located in the coding sequences were trinucleotide repeats. Allelic variation at 32 SSR loci produced 98 alleles in 20 cowpea genotypes. The polymorphic information content for the SSR markers varied from 0.10 to 0.83 with an average of 0.53. These unigene SSR markers showed a high rate of transferability (88%) across other Vigna species, thereby expanding their utility. Alignment of unigene sequences with soybean genomic sequences revealed the presence of introns in amplified products of some of the SSR markers. This study presents the distribution of SSRs in the expressed portion of the cowpea genome and is the first report of the development of functional unigene-based SSR markers in cowpea. These SSR markers would play an important role in molecular mapping, comparative genomics, and marker-assisted selection strategies in cowpea and other Vigna species.

AB Digestive amylase has been identified as a useful marker for breeding in the silkwrom, Bombyx mori L (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), due to its wide genetic divergence, its role in better digestibility and robustness. The low yielding indigenous B. mori breeds of tropics like India are characterized by high activity amylase genes controlled by Amy d(iv) or d(v) alleles, while the high yielding breeds of temperate origin are endowed with 'null' type (Amy d(n)) with low activity. For improving the digestibility and survival of temperate breeds of Japanese origin, Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) were developed introgressing the Amy d(iv) and d(v) alleles from the Donor Parents (DPs) into the genetic background of the Recurrent Parents (RPs) with 'null' type of amylase, which showed significant improvement in viability of the NILs. With the objective to know whether the amylase gene itself may confer higher survival by improving digestibility or some other closely linked genes flanking the amylase locus is responsible for better viability of the NILs, RAPD profiles among six B. mori breeds comprising of the DPs, RPs, and NILs developed through introgression of Amy div or dv alleles were analysed using 27 sets of RAPD primers. Out of the 27 primers, six (OPA01, OPA06, OPA09, OPA15, OPAH03, and OPAH05) showed RAPD products linked to the amylase genes of the DPs introgressed in the NILs, which were absent in their respective RPs. Three amplicons of 1584 bp, 1904 bp, and 1232 bp were specific to Amy div allele and one amplified product of 1776 bp was found to be linked with the Amy dv allele. Interestingly, two PCR products of 2628 and 1375 bp were associated with both Amy div and dv alleles. The results are discussed in light of further characterization of these amplified products leading to identification of DNA sequences that may be responsible for better digestibility and higher survival in B. mori.

AB Genetic analyses of adult plant stripe rust resistance in Australian wheat cvs Kukri and Sunco were performed using Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotype 134 E16A+ during 2003. Both cultivars showed the presence of three independent adult plant stripe rust resistance genes. Three types of responses were observed among monogenically segregating lines from both cvs Kukri and Sunco. Genotyping with the Lr34-linked marker csLV34 indicated the presence of the linked genes Lr34/Yr18 in cv. Sunco. The other two genes carried by cv. Sunco were YrCk and YrCk2. Based on pedigree analysis, cv. Kukri is expected to carry Yr29 and Yr30, but presence of loci different to these genes cannot be ruled out. The genetic independence of APR genes carried by cvs Kukri and Sunco was confirmed by segregation analysis of a F(3) population derived from a Sunco/Kukri cross.

AB Some root-associated pseudomonads sustain plant growth by suppressing root diseases caused by pathogenic fungi. We investigated to which extent select cereal cultivars influence expression of relevant biocontrol traits (i.e., root colonization efficacy and antifungal activity) in Pseudomonas fluorescens CHAO. In this representative plant-beneficial bacterium, the antifungal metabolites 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), pyrrolnitrin (PRN), pyoluteorin (PLT), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are required for biocontrol. To monitor host plant effects on the expression of biosynthetic genes for these compounds on roots, we developed fluorescent dual-color reporters suited for flow cytometric analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In the dual-label strains, the constitutively expressed red fluorescent protein mCherry served as a cell tag and marker for root colonization, whereas reporter fusions based on the green fluorescent protein allowed simultaneous recording of antifungal gene expression within the same cell. FACS analysis revealed that expression of DAPG and PRN biosynthetic genes was promoted in a cereal rhizosphere, whereas expression of PLT and HCN biosynthetic genes was markedly less sustained. When analyzing the response of the bacterial reporters on roots of a selection of wheat, spelt, and triticale cultivars, we were able to detect subtle species- and cultivar-dependent differences in colonization and DAPG and HCN gene expression levels. The expression of these biocontrol traits was particularly favored on roots of one spelt cultivar, suggesting that a careful choice of pseudomonad cereal combinations might be beneficial to biocontrol. Our approach may be useful for selective single-cell level analysis of plant effects in other bacteria root interactions.

AB Transposable elements (TE) exist in the genomes of nearly all eukaryotes. TE mobilization through 'cut-and-paste' or 'copy-and-paste' mechanisms causes their insertions into other repetitive sequences, gene loci and other DNA. An insertion of a TE commonly creates a unique TE junction in the genome. TE junctions are also randomly distributed along chromosomes and therefore useful for genome-wide marker development. Several TE-based marker systems have been developed and applied to genetic diversity assays, and to genetic and physical mapping. A software tool 'RJPrimers' reported here allows for accurate identification of unique repeat junctions using BLASTN against annotated repeat databases and a repeat junction finding algorithm, and then for fully automated high-throughput repeat junction-based primer design using Primer3 and BatchPrimer3. The software was tested using the rice genome and genomic sequences of Aegilops tauschii. Over 90% of repeat junction primers designed by RJPrimers were unique. At least one RJM marker per 10 Kb sequence of A. tauschii was expected with an estimate of over 0.45 million such markers in a genome of 4.02 Gb, providing an almost unlimited source of molecular markers for mapping large and complex genomes. A web-based server and a command line-based pipeline for RJPrimers are both available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/RJPrimers/.

   Resistance Genes
SO PLANT GENOME
LA English
DT Article
AB We previously identified a region near the centromere of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome 6H that harbors two closely linked net form net blotch resistance genes (rpt.r and rpt.k). In this study, we mined barley expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and developed EST-derived markers for further mapping of this region in a population derived from 'Rika' and 'Kombar'. Additionally, we did a comparative analysis of this region to other grass species. Fifteen newly developed markers were added to the previous map, and most were distributed within a 27.0-cM interval spanning rpt.r and rpt.k. The two resistance loci were delineated to a 1.6 cM genetic interval. Comparison of mapped ESTs along chromosome 6H to wheat bin-mapped ESTs suggests that rpt.r and rpt.k are most likely located on the long arm of chromosome 6H. Comparative analysis revealed that a 12.6-cM region containing the two resistance loci is colinear with a region of rice chromosome 2 between 23.7 and 29.9 Mb with only a few rearrangements, and nearly the same level of colinearity was observed between barley and Brachypodium in this region. This work refines the genetic and physical location of rpt.r and rpt.k and provides an initial step toward the map-based cloning of these two genes.

AB The narrow genetic background of wheat is the primary factor that has restricted the improvement of crop yield in recent years. The kernel number per spike is the most important factor of the many potential characteristics that determine wheat yield. Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn., a wild relative of wheat, has the characteristics of superior numbers of florets and kernels per spike, which are controlled by chromosome 6P. In this study, the wheat-A. cristatum disomic addition and substitution lines were used as bridge materials to produce wheat-A. cristatum 6P translocation lines induced by gametocidal chromosomes and irradiation. The results of genomic in situ hybridization showed that the frequency of translocation induced by gametocidal chromosomes was 5.08%, which was higher than the frequency of irradiated hybrids (2.78%) and irradiated pollen (2.12%). The fluorescence in situ hybridization results of the translocation lines showed that A. cristatum chromosome 6P could be translocated to wheat ABD genome, and the recombination frequency was A genome > B genome > D genome. The alien A. cristatum chromosome 6P was translocated to wheat homoeologous groups 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. We obtained abundant translocation lines that possessed whole-arm, terminal, segmental and intercalary translocations. Three 6PS-specific and four 6PL-specific markers will be useful to rapidly identify and trace the translocated fragments. The different wheat-A. cristatum 6P translocation lines obtained in this study can provide basic materials for analyzing the alien genes carried by chromosome 6P. The translocation line WAT33-1-3 and introgression lines WAI37-2 and WAI41-1, which had significant characteristics of multikernel (high numbers of kernels per spike), could be utilized as novel germplasms for high-yield wheat breeding.

AB Differences in selection patterns among habitats can alter the distribution of genetic diversity even when this is estimated with neutral markers. For plants, light is an essential resource that can influence both abiotic and biotic components of habitat. We examined genetic differentiation between sun and shade habitats in Lindera benzoin L. (Spicebush), a perennial understory shrub. Genetic diversity of 127 plants from sun and shade habitats in two populations of L. benzoin was determined using 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers. We analyzed patterns of genetic diversity using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), and we assessed correlation between genetic and geographic distance using Mantel tests. We found (1) low levels of differentiation among populations (F (ST) = 0.028), (2) little evidence of genetic structure within populations due to isolation-by-distance, and (3) some evidence of habitat-based genetic differentiation. Specifically, the AMOVA showed a small (0.5%) but significant portion of overall variation could be explained by differences between habitats. The overall low levels of differentiation we saw were likely a result of extensive gene flow in this dioecious, bird-dispersed species.

AB Biofortification through genetic manipulation is the best approach for improving micronutrient content of the staple food crops to alleviate hidden hunger, namely, the deficiency of Fe and Zn affecting more than two billion people worldwide. An interspecific hybridization was made between T. aestivum line Chinese Spring (CS) and Aegilops kotschyi accession 3790 selected for high grain iron and zinc concentration. The CS x Ae. kotschyi F(1) hybrid with low chromosome pairing was highly male and female sterile. This was backcrossed with wheat cultivars to get seed set. The selfed BC(1)F(1) and BC(2)F(1) plants with high grain iron and zinc concentration were selected in subsequent generations. The selected derivatives showed 60-136% enhanced grain iron and zinc concentration and 50-120% increased iron and zinc content per seed as compared to the recipient wheat cultivars. Thirteen cytologically stable, fertile and agronomically superior plants with high grain iron and zinc concentrations were selected for molecular characterization. The application of anchored wheat SSR markers, transferable to Ae. kotschyi, to the high grain iron and zinc containing derivatives indicated introgression of group 2 and group 7 chromosomes of Ae. kotschyi. GISH and FISH analysis of some derivatives confirmed the substitution of chromosomes 2S and 7U for their homoeologues of the A genome, suggesting that some of the genes controlling high grain micronutrient content in the Ae. kotschyi accession are on these chromosomes.

AB Little is known about the genetic impacts of modern plant breeding on specific breeding target loci. Resequencing cloned genes can identify all mutations in single genes for population-based analyses of genetic changes in improved gene pools. Ninety-five wheat cultivars released in Canada from 1845 to 2004 were sequenced at the wheat leaf rust resistance locus Lr21. Characterization of the DNA fragment of length 4,071 bp, covering the Lr21 gene from -92 to +4,261, revealed 13 SNPs, four indels, 10 haplotypes, and 4 major haplotype groups. A new SCAR marker was developed to identify the resistant haplotype and haplotype groups. Non-synonymous polymorphic sites and haplotype numbers were increased over the 100 years of wheat breeding. Nucleotide diversity of the wheat cultivars was gradually reduced from 1845 to 1993 and increased after the release of the first Lr21 wheat cultivar AC Cora in 1994. Positive selection measured with Tajima's D was observed in the cultivars released before 1935. At least two recombination events were inferred in those cultivars released before 1993. Linkage disequilibrium at the locus was decreased over time. These findings demonstrate not only the effectiveness of the wheat breeding in the improvement of leaf rust resistance, but also are useful to understand the genetic influences of a long-term artificial selection on individual loci.

AB Leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 is likely the most important leaf rust gene characterized to date. It has been characterized as an adult plant resistance gene and is known to enhance the resistance of other leaf rust resistance genes and to condition resistance to a number of other diseases. Located on chromosome 7D, this gene was identified to be one of six co-located genes of which, an ABC transporter was shown to be the only valid candidate. Ten new molecular markers were developed spanning the Lr34 locus, including six novel microsatellite markers (cam), one insertion site-based polymorphism marker (caISBP), two single nucleotide polymorphisms (caSNP), and one gene-specific marker (caIND). Using these new markers and others that were previously published, a comparative fine map of the locus was constructed from five segregating populations representing 1,742 lines. Identification of a susceptible line with a recombination in the 4.9 kb interval between caSNP4 located in the ABC transporter gene and cam8 located just upstream of this gene provided further evidence to support the identity of the ABC transporter as Lr34 by ruling out four of the adjacent genes. Originally, three mutations forming two haplotypes had been described for the ABC transporter gene. A third combination of the three mutations and an additional rare mutation in exon 22 were subsequently described. We identified an additional novel mutation in exon 10 that would cause a frameshift and is likely non-functional. This mutation was only found in Lr34- lines and constituted a novel molecular haplotype. Characterization of two germplasm collections of 700 Triticum aestivum lines permitted us to gain an understanding of the frequency of the ABC haplotypes characterized to date and their distribution in germplasm from and around the world. In addition to the four haplotypes previously described, a fifth haplotype was found in two of the 700 lines from the germplasm collections. These lines displayed the deletion in indel 11 characteristic of Lr34+ lines, but are likely susceptible to leaf rust. Mapping and haplotyping data suggest that of all the markers described herein, marker caIND11 is the best diagnostic marker for marker-assisted selection of Lr34 because it is co-dominant, robust and with the exception of 2/700 lines, it is highly diagnostic. Other markers are also described to provide alternatives for laboratories with different technologies.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks, is one of the most common and persistent wheat diseases in the US Great Plains. We report that the Lr34 gene was mapped in the center of a QTL for leaf rust reaction and explained 18-35% of the total phenotypic variation in disease severity of adult plants in a Jagger x 2174 population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) field-tested for 3 years. The sequence of the complete Lr34 gene was determined for the susceptible Jagger allele and for the resistant 2174 allele. The two alleles had exactly the same sequence as the resistant allele reported previously in Chinese Spring at three polymorphic sites in intron 4, exon 11, and exon 12. A G/T polymorphism was found in exon 22, where a premature stop codon was found in the susceptible Jagger allele (Lr34E22s), confirming a previous report, due to a point mutation compared with the resistant 2174 allele (Lr34E22r). We have experimentally demonstrated a tight association between the point mutation at exon 22 of Lr34 and leaf rust susceptibility in a segregating biparental population. A PCR marker was developed to distinguish between the Lr34E22r and Lr34E22s alleles. A survey of 33 local hard winter wheat cultivars indicated that 7 cultivars carry the Lr34E22s allele and 26 cultivars carry the Lr34E22r allele. This study significantly improves our genetic understanding of allelic variation in the Lr34 gene and provides a functional molecular tool to improve leaf rust resistance in a major US wheat gene pool.

AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA is a simple, cost effective, and rapid method for the specific detection of genomic DNA using a set of six oligonucleotide primers with eight binding sites hybridizing specifically to different regions of a target gene, and a thermophilic DNA polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus for DNA amplification. The method has been applied in various assays for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections of humans and animals, sexing of bovine and swine embryos, and in the detection of bacteria from environmental samples. Only recently, first applications for fungal organisms were published. During the current study a LAMP assay was developed for the specific detection of Fusarium graminearum, the major causative agent of Fusarium head blight of small cereals and producer of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and zearalenone. The assay was based on the gaoA gene (galactose oxidase) of the fungus. Amplification of DNA during the reaction was indirectly detected in situ by using calcein fluorescence as a marker without the necessity of time-consuming electrophoretic analysis. The assay was optimized for rapidness, specificity, and sensitivity and was shown to detect the presence of less than 2 pg of purified target DNA per reaction within 30 min. Within 132 fungal species tested, exclusively DNA isolated from cultures of F graminearum (lineages 1-9) resulted in a fluorescent signal after amplification with the IAMP assay. The method was demonstrated to be useful in the analysis of fungal cultures by direct analysis of surface scrapings from agar plate cultures, direct testing of single infected barley grains, and detection of F. graminearum in total genomic DNA isolated from bulk samples of ground wheat grains. Results obtained indicate that LAMP offers an interesting new assay format for the rapid and specific DNA-based detection and identification of agriculturally important toxigenic fungi in pure cultures and in contaminated sample materials and therefore presents an alternative to PCR-based assays.

AB Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was carried out in a set of 114 RILs of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) mapping population under salt stress. Seedling population was grown during 8 days, under salt treatment (Hoagland's 1/2 strength + 110 mM NaCl, EC 12.4 mS/cm) and normal treatment (Hoagland's 1/2 strength, EC 0.9 mS/cm). We calculated starch degradation, measuring the dry weight of the grains on the 4th, 6th and 8th days of culturing. Formation of biomass was calculated measuring leaf and root length on the 4th, 6th and 8th days of culture. Interval mapping resulted in 13 QTLs, 2 major QTLs (LOD> 3) and 11 minors QTLs (LOD> 2). A total of 10 QTLs were associated with saline treatment and 3 QTLs at normal treatment. The data show that a high percentage of QTLs were in chromosomes 2B (3, 23.0%), and 1A (3, 23.0%), followed by 4D (2, 13.6%).

AB Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) was used to identify molecular markers associated with yellow rust disease resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). DNAs isolated from the selected yellow rust tolerant and susceptible F(2) individuals derived from a cross between yellow rust resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes were used to established a "tolerant" and a "susceptible" DNA pool. The BSA was then performed on these DNA pools using 230 markers that were previously mapped onto the individual wheat chromosomes. One of the SSR markers (Xgwm382) located on chromosome group 2 (A, B, D genomes) was present in the resistant parent and the resistant bulk but not in the susceptible parent and the susceptible bulk, suggesting that this marker is linked to a yellow rust resistance gene. The presence of Xgwm382 was also tested in 108 additional wheat genotypes differing in yellow rust resistance. This analysis showed that 81% of the wheat genotypes known to be yellow rust resistant had the Xgwm382 marker, further suggesting that the presence of this marker correlates with yellow rust resistance in diverse wheat germplasm. Therefore, Xgwm382 could be useful for marker assisted selection of yellow rust resistances genotypes in wheat breeding programs.

AB A leaf rust resistance gene transferred from the tetraploid wheat Triticum timopheevii (Zhuk.) Zhuk. (genomic composition: A(t)A(t)GG) into common wheat Triticum aestivum L. conditioned resistance at the seedling and adult plant stages in the introgression line 'line 842-2'. To determine chromosome location and to map the resistance gene an F(2) population from a cross between 'line 842-2' and susceptible wheat cultivar 'Skala' was developed and screened against leaf rust pathotype 77 (Puccinia triticina Erikss.). Microsatellite markers detected introgressions of the T. timopheevii genome on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 5B and 6B of 'line 842-2'. Linkage analysis revealed an association between leaf rust resistance and microsatellite markers located on chromosome 5B. The markers Xgwm880 and Xgwm1257 were closely linked to the resistance gene with genetic distances of 7.7 cM and 10.4 cM, respectively. Infection type tests with three leaf rust isolates resulted in different patterns of infection types of 'line 842-2' and 'Thatcher' near-isogenic line with the Lr18 gene on chromosome 5B. The data corroborated the hypothesis of the diversity of the resistance coming from T. timopheevii. The resistance gene of the introgression 'line 842-2' seems to be different than Lr18 and therefore it was designated LrTt2.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping often results in data on a number of traits that have well-established causal relationships. Many multi-trait QTL mapping methods that account for correlation among the multiple traits have been developed to improve the statistical power and the precision of QTL parameter estimation. However, none of these methods are capable of incorporating the causal structure among the traits. Consequently, genetic functions of the QTL may not be fully understood. In this paper, we developed a Bayesian multiple QTL mapping method for causally related traits using a mixture structural equation model (SEM), which allows researchers to decompose QTL effects into direct, indirect and total effects. Parameters are estimated based on their marginal posterior distribution. The posterior distributions of parameters are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods such as the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis Hasting algorithm. The number of QTLs affecting traits is determined by the Bayes factor. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation study and applied to data from a wheat experiment. Compared with single trait Bayesian analysis, our proposed method not only improved the statistical power of QTL detection, accuracy and precision of parameter estimates but also provided important insight into how genes regulate traits directly and indirectly by fitting a more biologically sensible model.

AB The P genome of Agropyron Gaertn., a wild relative of wheat, contains an abundance of desirable genes that can be utilized as genetic resources to improve wheat. In this study, wheat - Aegliops cylindrica Host gametocidal chromosome 2C addition lines were crossed with wheat Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. disomic addition line accession II-21 with alien recombinant chromosome (1.4)P. We successfully induced wheat A. cristatum alien chromosomal translocations for the first time. The frequency of translocation in the progeny was 3.75%, which was detected by molecular markers and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The translocation chromosomes were identified by dual-color GISH /fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The P genomic DNA was used as probe to detect the (1.4)P chromosome fragment, and pHvG39, pAs1, or pSc119.2 repeated sequences were used as probes to identify wheat translocated chromosomes. The results showed that six types of translocations were identified in the three wheat A. cristatum alien translocation lines, including the whole arm or terminal portion of a (1.4)P chromosome. The (1.4)P chromosome fragments were translocated to wheat chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5B, and 3D. The breakpoints were located at the centromeres of 1B and 2B, the pericentric locations of 5BS, and the terminals of 5BL and 3DS. In addition, we obtained 12 addition deletion lines that contained alien A. cristatum chromosome (1.4)P in wheat background. All of these wheat A. cristatum alien translocation lines and addition deletion lines would be valuable for identifying A. cristatum chromosome (1.4)P-related genes and providing genetic resources and new germplasm accessions for the genetic improvement of wheat. The specific molecular markers of A. cristatum (1.4)P chromosome have been developed and used to track the (1.4)P chromatin.

AB The responses to low red light/far-red light (R/FR) ratios simulating dense stands were evaluated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L) cultivars released at different times in the 20th century and consequently resulting from an increasingly prolonged breeding and selection history. While tillering responses to the R/FR ratio were unaffected by the cultivars, low R/FR ratios reduced grain yield per plant (primarily grain number and secondarily grain weight per plant) particularly in modern cultivars. Low R/FR ratios delayed spike growth and development, reduced the expression of spike marker genes, accelerated the development of florets already initiated, and reduced the number of fertile florets at anthesis. It is noteworthy that low R/FR ratios did not promote stem or leaf sheath growth and therefore the observed reduction of yield cannot be accounted for as a consequence of divergence of resources towards increased plant stature. It is proposed that the regulation of yield components by the R/FR ratio could help plants to adjust to the limited availability of resources under crop conditions.

AB Race-specific resistance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f.sp. tritici is often short-lived. Slow-rusting resistance has been reported to be a more durable type of resistance. A set of sixteen bread wheat varieties along with a susceptible control Morocco was tested during 2004-05 to 2006-07 in field plots at Peshawar (Pakistan) to identify slow rusting genotypes through epidemiological variables including final rust severity (FRS), apparent infection rate (r), area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), average coefficients of infection (ACI) and leaf tip necrosis (LTN). Epidemiological parameters of resistance were significantly (P < 0.01) different for years/varieties in three seasons, while variety x year interactions remained non-significant. Sequence tagged site (STS) marker, csLV34 analyses revealed that cultivars Faisalabad-83, Bahawalpur-95, Suleman-96, Punjab-96, Bakhtawar-93, Faisalabad-85, Shahkar-95 and Kohsar-95 possessed Yr18 linked allele. Faisalabad-83, Bahawalpur-95, Suleman-96, Punjab-96, Bakhtawar-93 and Faisalabad-85 were relatively more stable over 3-years where FRS, AUDPC and r values reduced by 80, 84 and 70% respectively compared to control Morocco. These six varieties therefore could be exploited for the deployment of Yr18 in breeding for slow rusting in wheat. Both FRS and ACI are suitable parameters for phenotypic selection.

AB A male sterile line was isolated in marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) and cytological analysis determined this to be a novel genic male sterility trait (Tems). Through the use of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA), tightly linked markers of Tems were identified with a view towards a map-based cloning strategy. It was found that spontaneous homeotic conversion of floral organs was the underlying cause of the male sterility in this marigold line. Thus, petals of male sterile plants resembled sepal-like structures and the stamens were partially converted to styles, although without the full characteristics or function of the true style organs. We have constructed a fine marker-based map for the Tems gene. This is intended to provide a tool for marker assisted selection (MAS) strategies in hybrid breeding and map-based cloning strategies for the male sterility locus. We discuss the significance of this spontaneously derived genic male sterility trait relating to the homeotic conversion of floral organs in marigold.

AB The Chinese winter wheat cultivar Zhoumai 22 is highly resistant to powdery mildew. The objectives of this study were to map a powdery mildew resistance gene in Zhoumai 22 using molecular markers and investigate its allelism with Pm13. A total of 278 F(2) and 30 BC(1) plants, and 143 F(3) lines derived from the cross between resistant cultivar Zhoumai 22 and susceptible cultivar Chinese Spring were used for resistance gene tagging. The 137 F(2) plants from the cross Zhoumai 22/2761-5 (Pm13) were employed for the allelic test of the resistance genes. Two hundred and ten simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to test the two parents, and resistant and susceptible bulks. Subsequently, seven polymorphic markers were used for genotyping the F(2) and F(3) populations. The results indicated that the powdery mildew resistance in Zhoumai 22 was conferred by a single dominant gene, designated PmHNK tentatively, flanked by seven SSR markers Xgwm299, Xgwm108, Xbarc77, Xbarc84, Xwmc326, Xwmc291 and Xwmc687 on chromosome 3BL. The resistance gene was closely linked to Xwmc291 and Xgwm108, with genetic distances of 3.8 and 10.3 cM, respectively, and located on the chromosome bin 3BL-7-0.63-1.0 in the test with a set of deletion lines. Seedling tests with seven isolates of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) and allellic test indicated that PmHNK is different from Pm13, and Pm41 seems also to be different from PmHNK due to its origin from T. dicoccoides and molecular evidence. These results indicate that PmHNK is likely to be a novel powdery mildew resistance gene in wheat.

AB Late maturity alpha-amylase (LMA) is a genetic defect of wheat which results in the production of alpha-amylase, shown as substandard falling numbers, in the absence of preharvest rain and under cool temperatures during ripening. The present study is an attempt to use a whole-genome scan with DArT markers to identify chromosomal regions influencing LMA in synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW). A high heritability estimate of 86.6% was calculated for LMA phenotype measured as optical density in a collection of 91 SHWs. Linkage disequilibrium extended up to 10 cM, and with controls for false positives, significant markers were detected at the chromosome 7B region previously linked to LMA in bread wheat, but not at the chromosome 3B region. Of potentially great interest is a region on chromosome 6B, which was identified as having a significant association with LMA phenotypes in the SHW accessions. Previous investigations suggested existence of an LMA gene on the long arm of 6B, but this is the first time it has been mapped to lie within the centromeric region of chromosome 6B, a region that harbours the Amy-1 genes and whose expression governs activity of the high pI alpha-amylase isoenzymes.

AB Many animal and plant species exhibit increased growth rates, reach larger sizes and, in the cases of crops and farm animals, produce higher yields when bred as hybrids between genetically differing strains, a phenomenon known as hybrid vigour or heterosis. Despite the importance of heterosis, and its extensive genetic analysis, little understanding exists of its molecular basis. We aimed to determine whether characteristics of the leaf transcriptome, as an indicator of the innate functional genetic architecture of a plant line, could be used as markers to predict heterosis and the performance of hybrids, a methodology we term Association Transcriptomics. Relationships between transcript abundance of specific genes and the values of heterosis and heterosis-dependent traits were identified and mathematical models were constructed that relate gene expression characteristics in inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and maize with vegetative biomass and grain yield, respectively, in corresponding hybrids. These models were used to predict, using gene expression data, the performance of additional hybrids. The success of the application in a monocot crop of a methodology developed in a dicot model species indicates that transcriptional markers may have widespread applicability in hybrid breeding.

AB Molecular markers based on retrotransposon insertions are widely used for various applications including phylogenetic analysis. Multiple cases were described where retrotransposon-based markers, namely sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP), were superior to other marker types in resolving the phylogenetic relationships due to their higher variability and informativeness. However, the patterns of evolutionary relationships revealed by SSAP may be dependent on the underlying retrotransposon activity in different periods of time. Hence, the proper choice of retrotransposon family is essential for obtaining significant results. We compared the phylogenetic trees for a diverse set of diploid A-genome wheat species (Triticum boeoticum, T. urartu and T. monococcum) based on two unrelated retrotransposon families, BARE-1 and Jeli. BARE-1 belongs to Copia class and has a uniform distribution between common wheat (T. aestivum) genomes of different origin (A, B and D), indicating similar activity in the respective diploid genome donors. Gypsy-class family Jeli was found by us to be an A-genome retrotransposon with > 70% copies residing in A genome of hexaploid common wheat, suggesting a burst of transposition in the history of A-genome progenitors. The results indicate that a higher Jeli transpositional activity was associated with T. urartu versus T. boeoticum speciation, while BARE-1 produced more polymorphic insertions during subsequent intraspecific diversification; as an outcome, each retrotransposon provides more informative markers at the corresponding level of phylogenetic relationships. We conclude that multiple retroelement families should be analyzed for an image of evolutionary relationships to be solid and comprehensive.

AB P>Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is an important bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) disease that is favoured by the temperate Scandinavian climate. A total of 38 lines, comprising the current spring and winter wheat cultivars in Norway, various breeding lines and introduced sources of partial resistance were evaluated for race-specific resistance at the seedling stage. Various resistance genes were postulated from the reaction patterns of lines with known genes tested against 20 differential isolates in detached leaf assays. Detection of the Pm8 gene and alleles at the Pm3 locus were further aided by specific PCR primers. The most frequently present resistance genes were Pm8, followed by Pm5a, Pm3d, Pm3f, Pm3b and Pm2. Several lines were susceptible to all isolates at the seedling stage, but were known to possess high levels of partial resistance in the field; these included the German spring wheats 'Naxos' and 'Paros' and the Swedish winter wheats 'Folke' and 'Mj circle divide lner'. These lines represent highly valuable sources of partial and potentially durable resistance to powdery mildew.

AB New races of wheat stem rust, namely TTKSK (Ug99) and its variants, pose a threat to wheat production in the regions where they are found. The accession of the wheat cultivar Webster (RL6201) maintained at the Cereal Research Centre in Winnipeg, Canada, shows resistance to TTKSK and other races of stem rust. The purpose of this study was to study the inheritance of seedling resistance to stem rust in RL6201 and genetically map the resistance genes using microsatellite (SSR) markers. A population was produced by crossing the stem rust susceptible line RL6071 with Webster. The F(2) and F(3) were tested with TPMK, a stem rust race native to North America. The F(3) was also tested with TTKSK. Two independently assorting genes were identified in RL6201. Resistance to TPMK was conferred by Sr30, which was mapped with microsatellites on chromosome 5DL. The second gene, temporarily designated SrWeb, conferred resistance to TTKSK. SrWeb was mapped to chromosome 2BL using SSR markers. Comparison with previous genetic maps showed that SrWeb occupies a locus near Sr9. Further analysis will be required to determine if SrWeb is a new gene or an allele of a previously identified gene.

AB Qfhi.nau-4B is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) against Fusarium graminearum infection identified in the Fusarium head blight-resistant germplasm Wangshuibai. To fine map this QTL, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 530 lines derived from Nanda2419 x Wangshuibai and the BC(3)F(2) population derived from the cross of a Qfhi.nau-4B near isogenic line (NIL) with susceptible cultivar Mianyang 99-323 as the recurrent parent were screened for recombinants occurred between microsatellite markers Xbarc20 and Xwmc349 that flank Qfhi.nau-4B. A total of 95 recombinants were obtained, including 45 RIL recombinants obtained through reverse-selection of Qfhi.nau-5A and 50 NIL recombinants from the BC(3)F(2) population. Genotyping these recombinant lines with 22 markers mapping to the Xbarc20 and Xwmc349 interval revealed fourteen genotypes of the RIL recombinants as well as of the NIL recombinants. Two-year field evaluation of their resistance to Fusarium infection showed that these lines could be clearly classified into two groups according to percentage of infected spikes. The more resistant class had over 60% less infection than the susceptible class and were common to have Wangshuibai chromatin in the 1.7-cM interval flanked by Xhbg226 and Xgwm149. None of the susceptible recombinants had this Wangshuibai chromatin. Qfhi.nau-4B was thus confined between Xhbg226 and Xgwm149 and named Fhb4. The interval harboring Fhb4 was mapped to 4BL5-0.86-1.00 bin using Chinese Spring deletion lines, a region with about 5.7 times higher recombination rate than the genome average. This study established the basis for map-based cloning of Fhb4.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. The best strategy to control stripe rust is to grow resistant cultivars. One such cultivar resistant to most races in North America is 'IDO377s'. To study the genetics of its resistance this spring wheat cultivar was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AvS). Seedlings of the parents, F(2) plants, and F(3) lines were tested under controlled greenhouse conditions with races PST-43 and PST-45 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. IDO377s carries a single dominant gene for resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. A total of ten markers were identified, two of which flanked the locus at 4.4 and 5.5 cM. These flanking RGAP markers were located on chromosome 2B with nulli-tetrasomic lines of 'Chinese Spring'. Their presence in the ditelosomic 2BL line localized them to the long arm. The chromosomal location of the resistance gene was further confirmed with two 2BL-specific SSR markers and a sequence tagged site (STS) marker previously mapped to 2BL. Based on the chromosomal location, reactions to various races of the pathogen and tests of allelism, the IDO377s gene is different from all previously designated genes for stripe rust resistance, and is therefore designated Yr43. A total of 108 wheat breeding lines and cultivars with IDO377s or related cultivars in their parentage were assayed to assess the status of the closest flanking markers and to select lines carrying Yr43. The results showed that the flanking markers were reliable for assisting selection of breeding lines carrying the resistance gene. A linked stripe rust resistance gene, previously identified as YrZak, in cultivar Zak was designated Yr44.

AB The male-sterile lines with Ms2 gene were highly evaluated in recurrent selection in wheat (Triticum aestivum L). Three populations C6 (population after six cycles of selection), C7 (population after seven cycles of selection), and C8 (population after eight cycles of selection) were constructed through recurrent selection with 12 parental materials (P) Acid polyacrymide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) analysis was used to identify gliadin patterns and evaluate the genetic diversity in 12 parents and three populations A total of 63 bands were identified, of which 17 polymorphic bands and 7 unique bands were present in populations and seven polymorphic bands and four unique bands were present in parents The number of polymorphic and Unique. bands decreased gradually from C6 to C8, especially for omega- and gamma-gliadins The genetic distances in C6. C7, and C8 were calculated. The distributions of genetic distance were different in three recurrent selection populations From C6 to C8, the genetic distance was 0 2687, 0 2652 and 0.1987, respectively Statistically significant differences were detected between C7 and C8 with the T value of 37.9718 The result of cluster analysis based on genetic similarity matrix of three populations fitted well to those of principle coordinates analysis (PCoA). Compared with 12 parents. almost all individuals of three populations are new genotypes. Most of the individuals from C6 and C7 could be divided into two groups, while most individuals of C8 were in one cluster In conclusion, the results indicated that the genetic diversity was decreased severely according to the information revealed by A-PAGE, although some variations could be created in the recurrent selection It was necessary to introduce diverse germplasm based on the generic database of recurrent population to maintain and improve the breeding efficiency in the further program

TI Wheat gene bank accessions as a source of new alleles of the powdery
   mildew resistance gene Pm3: a large scale allele mining project
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

   BREAD WHEAT; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SEED BANKS; BARLEY; EVOLUTION; LOCUS;
   IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: In the last hundred years, the development of improved wheat cultivars has led to the replacement of landraces and traditional varieties by modern cultivars. This has resulted in a decline in the genetic diversity of agriculturally used wheat. However, the diversity lost in the elite material is somewhat preserved in crop gene banks. Therefore, the gene bank accessions provide the basis for genetic improvement of crops for specific traits and and represent rich sources of novel allelic variation.
   Results: We have undertaken large scale molecular allele mining to isolate new alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 from wheat gene bank accessions. The search for new Pm3 alleles was carried out on a geographically diverse set of 733 wheat accessions originating from 20 countries. Pm3 specific molecular tools as well as classical pathogenicity tests were used to characterize the accessions. Two new functional Pm3 alleles were identified out of the eight newly cloned Pm3 sequences. These new resistance alleles were isolated from accessions from China and Nepal. Thus, the repertoire of functional Pm3 alleles now includes 17 genes, making it one of the largest allelic series of plant resistance genes. The combined information on resistant and susceptible Pm3 sequences will allow to study molecular function and specificity of functional Pm3 alleles.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that molecular allele mining on geographically defined accessions is a useful strategy to rapidly characterize the diversity of gene bank accessions at a specific genetic locus of agronomical importance. The identified wheat accessions with new resistance specificities can be used for marker-assisted transfer of the Pm3 alleles to modern wheat lines.

AB Background: The high-throughput anchoring of genetic markers into contigs is required for many ongoing physical mapping projects. Multidimentional BAC pooling strategies for PCR-based screening of large insert libraries is a widely used alternative to high density filter hybridisation of bacterial colonies. To date, concerns over reliability have led most if not all groups engaged in high throughput physical mapping projects to favour BAC DNA isolation prior to amplification by conventional PCR.
   Results: Here, we report the first combined use of Multiplex Tandem PCR (MT-PCR) and High Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis on bacterial stocks of BAC library superpools as a means of rapidly anchoring markers to BAC colonies and thereby to integrate genetic and physical maps. We exemplify the approach using a BAC library of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Super pools of twenty five 384-well plates and two-dimension matrix pools of the BAC library were prepared for marker screening. The entire procedure only requires around 3 h to anchor one marker.
   Conclusions: A pre-amplification step during MT-PCR allows high multiplexing and increases the sensitivity and reliability of subsequent HRM discrimination. This simple gel-free protocol is more reliable, faster and far less costly than conventional PCR screening. The option to screen in parallel 3 genetic markers in one MT-PCR-HRM reaction using templates from directly pooled bacterial stocks of BAC-containing bacteria further reduces time for anchoring markers in physical maps of species with large genomes.

AB In the present study the microsatellite marker Xgwm261, linked to Rht 8 gene as well as allele specific markers for Ppd-D1 (Ppd1), Vrn-1A and Vrn-1D loci, and the gibberellic acid (GA) test were employed to examine the distribution of semi-dwarf and photoperiod response and vernalization genes in 21 old and modern Bulgarian, 4 introduced cultivars and 11 advanced breeding lines from the wheat germplasm collections of DAI, General Toshevo, Institute of Genetics, Sofia and IPGR, Sadovo. Several allele variants were identified at locus Xgwm261, among which the 192 bp allele can serve as a diagnostic marker for the presence of Rht 8 gene. The Ppd-D1a, vrn-A1 and vrn-D1 alleles were found in almost all wheat genotypes illustrating the relationship between the photoperiod and vernalization response and the adaptability to the regional environments. The photoperiod insensitivity allele (Ppd-D1 a) was found in 93.3% of analyzed modern cultivars released during 1960-2003 and has been most probably introduced from the Ukrainian cultivar Bezostaya1 (192 bp allele at locus Xgwm261), which is the main donor of Rht 8 gene in Bulgarian wheat. All studied modern Bulgarian wheat cultivars excluding cv. Laska (vrn-A1, Vrn-D1) and cv. Gladiator 113 (Vrn-A1a, vrn-D1) were of winter type (vrn-A1 and vrn-D1). Allele Vrn-A1c determining also spring type was not found in the studied set of the old and modern Bulgarian wheat cultivars. The association between specific alleles at the Rht-B1, Xgwm261, Ppd-D1, Vrn1 loci with plant height, heading time and some yield related traits was also examined. The results suggested that allele combination Ppd-D1a/vrn-A1, vrn-D1 led to earlier heading than the allele combination Ppd-D1b/vrn-A1, vrn-D1.
   The recombinant genotypes obtained from the crosses between photoperiod sensitive spring and photoperiod insensitive winter type wheat behave differently under autumn and spring sowing. Under early spring sowing the earliest heading dates and yield per m(2) were observed in lines with Ppd-D1a/Vrn-A1, vrn-D1 and Ppd-D1b/Vrn-A1, vrn-D1 allele combinations.

AB Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. To isolate defense-related genes against the pathogen, a suppression subtractive hybridization library was constructed for an incompatible interaction. From the library, 652 sequences were determined to be unigenes, of which 31 were determined as genes involved in signal transduction and 77 were predicted to encode defense-related proteins. Expression patterns of 12 selected signal transduction and defense-related genes were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Signal transduction genes started increasing their expression at 12 h post inoculation (hpi), and expressions of the most of the transport and resistance-related genes were induced at 18 hpi. The gene expression results indicate specific molecular and cellular activities during the incompatible interaction between wheat and the stripe rust pathogen. In general, the expression increase of wheat signal transduction genes soon after inoculation with the pathogen inducing various defense-related genes, including reactive oxygen species, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, pathogenesis-related proteins, and genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The activities of these defense genes work in a sequential and concerted manner to result in a hypersensitive response.

AB Within Erianthus, a genus close to Saccharum, the species E. arundinaceus has the potential to contribute valuable traits to sugarcane, including adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses and ratooning ability. Sugarcane breeders have tried for a long time to use Erianthus species in their breeding programs but until recently were constrained by a lack of fertile Saccharum x Erianthus hybrids. We report here for the first time the chromosome composition of fertile Saccharum officinarum x E. arundinaceus F(1), BC(1) (F(1) x sugarcane cultivar), and BC(2) (BC(1) x sugarcane cultivar) hybrids. The F(1) and BC(2) resulted from n + n chromosome transmission, while the BC(1) resulted from 2n + n transmission. In the BC(1) clones, the number of E. arundinaceus chromosomes ranged from 21 to 30, and in the BC(2) clones, the number ranged from 14 to 15, revealing cases of chromosome loss. No recombination events between Saccharum and Erianthus chromosomes were observed in either the BC(1) or BC(2) clones. The implications of these results for introgression of genes from E. arundinaceus in sugarcane breeding programs are discussed. We propose a strategy to identify the agronomic value of chromosomes from E. arundinaceus and to conduct targeted breeding based on this information.

AB Genetic stocks WR95 and Sel.T3336 were screened against most prevalent races of stem rust viz., 40A, 40-1 and 117-6 at seedling stage under controlled conditions. Both the genetic stocks, WR95 and Sel.T3336 were found resistant to all the three races. Genetic analysis revealed that WR95 carries a single recessive gene for rust resistance. An effort was made to locate the gene using monosomic series, however, the gene proved to be hemizygous ineffective in monosomic F(1)s. WR95 was also screened with validated molecular markers of the stem rust resistance genes Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr31, Sr36, and Sr38. None of these genes could be detected in WR95 showing that the resistance gene present in WR95 is diverse from these genes. Sel T3336 showed segregation for one stem rust resistance gene against race 40-1. However, screening with molecular markers showed the presence of stem rust resistance genes Sr24 and Sr26 in Sel.T3336. The resistance identified in WR95 may prove very useful in breeding.

AB Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) play a key role in determining the processing quality of the end-use products of common wheat. The objectives of this study were to identify genes at Glu-A3 locus, develop the STS markers, and establish multiplex PCR with the STS markers for Glu-A3 alleles. Gene-specific PCR primers were designed to amplify six near-isogenic lines (NILs) and Glenlea with different Glu-A3 alleles (a, b, c, d, e, f and g) defined by the protein electrophoretic mobility. Three Glu-A3 genes with complete coding sequence were cloned, designated as GluA3-1, GluA3-2 and GluA3-3, respectively. Seven dominant allele-specific STS (sequence tagged sites) markers were designed based on the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) among different allelic variants for the discrimination of the Glu-A3 protein alleles a, b, c, d, e, f and g. Four multiplex PCRs were established including Glu-A3b + Glu-A3f, Glu-A3d + Glu-A3f, Glu-A3d + Glu-A3g, and Glu-A3b + Glu-A3e. These markers and multiplex-PCR systems were validated on 141 CIMMYT wheat varieties and advanced lines with different Glu-A3 alleles, confirming that they can be efficiently used in marker-assisted breeding.

AB Identification of genetic markers involved in stress response to physical factors or chemical substances in organisms is a challenging task. Typing of upregulated gene expression due to selective antibacterial pressure is a promising approach in the search of molecular mechanisms responsible for development of resistance. cDNA-Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (cDNA-FAFLP) strategy was developed and applied in the search of antimycotic drug resistance marker(s) in medically important fungi as an alternative method to microarray analysis. We compared differential gene expression of two sensitive Candida albicans reference strains (ATCC 10231 and ATCC 60133) and two of their paired resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole mutants. Resistant mutants Candida albicans FLC-R, resistant to fluconazole (MIC > 128 mu g/ml) and Candida albicans ICZ-R, resistant to itraconazole (MIC > 4 mu g/ml) were obtained in subcultures with gradual increase of the antifungal in the culture medium. cDNA-AFLP profile in both itraconazole resistant mutants showed specific spectrophotometric peaks with 5-6-fold RNA overexpression product of 500 bp length compared to the sensitive strains. Fluconazole mutants do not reveal RNA level changes under tested by us typing conditions. These results indicate that the cDNA-FAFLP strategy is a relatively rapid, simple, and reliable method for simultaneous typing of both constitutive and induced differences in expression of host genes providing insight into the biological processes involved in response to drugs in bacteria and fungi. Moreover, this methodology could be tested for typing of the genome response of any organism to physical or chemical stress factors.

AB Scab caused by the pathogen Venturia inaequalis is considered the most important fungal disease of cultivated apple (Mains x domestica Borkh.). In all, 16 monogenic resistances against scab have been found in different Mains spp. and some of them are currently used in apple breeding for scab-resistant cultivars. However, the self incompatibility and the long generation time of Malus spp. together with the high standards of fruit quality demanded from the fresh market render the breeding of high-quality cultivars in apple a long and expensive task. Therefore, the cloning of disease resistance genes and the use of the cloned genes for the transformation of high-quality apple cultivars could be an approach to solve these drawbacks. We report the construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning the Rvi15 (Vr2) apple scab resistance locus using two GMAL 2473 BAC libraries. A single BAC clone of the contig was sufficient to span the resistance locus. The BAC clone was completely sequenced, allowing identification of a sequence of 48.6 kb going from the two closest markers (ARGH17 and 77G20RP) bracketing Rvi15 (Vr2). Analysis of the 48.6-kb sequence revealed the presence of three putative genes characterized by a Toll and mammalian interleukin-1 receptor protein nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat structure. All three genes were found to be transcribed.

AB Background and aims: Whole-grain cereals and diets with a low glycemic index may protect against the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We studied the effect of carbohydrate modification on serum metabolic profiles, including lipids and branched chain amino acids, and dependencies between these and specific gene expression pathways in adipose tissue.
   Methods and results: Twenty subjects with metabolic syndrome were selected from the larger FUNGENUT study population, randomized either to a diet high in oat and wheat bread and potato (OWP) or rye bread and pasta (RP). Serum metabolomics analyses were performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS), gas chromatography (GC) and UPLC.
   In the OWP group multiple proinflammatory lysophosphatidylcholines increased, while in the RP group docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6n-3) increased and isoleucine decreased. mRNA expression of stress reactions- and adipose tissue differentiation-related genes were up-regulated in adipose tissue in the OWP group. In the RP group, however, pathways related to stress reactions and insulin signaling and energy metabolism were down-regulated. The lipid profiles had the strongest association with the changes in the adipose tissue differentiation pathway when using the elastic net regression model of the lipidomic profiles on selected pathways. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the dietary carbohydrate modification alters the serum metabolic profile, especially in lysoPC species, and may, thus, contribute to proinflammatory processes which in turn promote adverse changes in insulin and glucose metabolism.

AB Stagonospora nodorum is a foliar pathogen of wheat that produces several host-selective toxins (HSTs) and causes the disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB). The wheat genes Snn1 and Tsn1 confer sensitivity to the HSTs SnTox1 and SnToxA, respectively. The objectives of this study were to dissect, quantify, and compare the effects of compatible Snn1-SnTox1 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions on susceptibility in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem. Inoculation of a wheat doubled haploid population that segregates for both Snn1 and Tsn1 with an S. nodorum isolate that produces both SnTox1 and SnToxA indicated that both interactions were strongly associated with SNB susceptibility. The Snn1-SnTox1 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions explained 22 and 28% of the variation in disease, respectively, and together they explained 48% indicating that their effects are largely additive. The Snn1-SnTox1 interaction accounted for 50% of the variation when the population was inoculated with an S. nodorum strain where the SnToxA gene had been mutated, eliminating the Tsn1-SnToxA interaction. These results support the theory that the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem is largely based on multiple host-toxin interactions that follow an inverse gene-for-gene scenario at the host-toxin interface, but disease exhibits quantitative variation due to the mainly additive nature of compatible interactions. The elimination of either Snn1 or Tsn1 toxin sensitivity alleles resulted in decreased susceptibility, but the elimination of both interactions was required to obtain high levels of resistance. We propose the use of molecular markers to select against Snn1, Tsn1, and other toxin sensitivity alleles to develop wheat varieties with high levels of SNB resistance.

A total of 184 alleles were detected on 24 SSR loci, and the number of alleles on each locus ranged front 2 to 15, with an average of 7 667 The total gene diversity (H 0 683) and the coefficient of population differentiation (G(sr)=0 125) showed that P huashanica had a relatively high level of genetic variation, and the genetic variation was mainly distributed within the populations The gene flow among the populations of P. huashanica (Nm=1.750) was much less than that of the common anemophytes (Nm=5 24). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the number of alleles as well as genetic diversity of the five populations of Huangpu valley decreased along with the increase of altitudes, but the correlation was not significant Implications of these results for future P. hunshanica collection, evaluation and conservation were discussed.

AB Thirty-six Merino Branco lambs were assigned to six dietary treatments: control diet (C) consisting of 90% dehydrated lucerne and 10% wheat bran; control diet with 6% of oil blend (CO); control with 2.5% of grape seed extract (GS); control with 2.5% of grape seed extract and 6% of oil blend (GSO); control with 25% of Cistus ladanifer (an aromatic bush widespread in Portugal; CL): control with 25% of C ladanifer and 6% of oil blend (CLO). The muscle longissimus dorsi was then Subjected to the analysis of volatile compounds (SPME-GC/MS). The CLO diet increased the concentration of heptanal, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone and 2-ethyl-phenol in muscle compared to the CL diet. When lambs received the CL diet, their meat contained lower amounts of 4-heptenal compared to the other treatments. The meat of the GS and GSO lambs contained similar amounts of volatile compounds deriving from lipid oxidation (such as heptanal, 2-nonenal, 4-heptenal and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone). These results indicate that in the presence of grape seed extract, oil supplementation did not enhance the production of lipid-derived volatile compounds. Verbenone and 2,2,6-trimethyl-cyclohexanone were detected only in the meat of the Cistus-fed lambs, suggesting that these compounds could be markers of feeding Cistus-containing diets. Meat volatile compounds profile allowed to discriminate between the lambs receiving C ladanifer and those not receiving this bush in the diet. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To prevent lodging and sprouting damage in rye, a dominant dwarfing gene, Ddw1, has been incorporated into breeding lines to reduce plant height in Finland. However, the inability to identify heterozygous plants makes it difficult to purify breeding lines. Doubled haploidy (EM-1 x Voima) and bulked segregant analysis were used to search for an efficient PCR-based tool to identify homozygous short plants. In addition, SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers were created from the endosperm-specific beta-amylase gene and the microsatellite locus REMS1218 expressed in rye and known to be located near Ddw1. The best marker was a combination of the microsatellite REMS1218 and the SNP created from it, located 13 cM from the QTL corresponding to Ddw1. However, for a rye breeder, the SNP alone is an adequate tool to identify plants homozygous for the EM-1 allele and it can be used in selection for the desirable growth habit in rye.

AB Genetic diversity was investigated in a set of 27 barley genotypes, originated from Egypt, using 23 expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived simple sequence repeats (eSSRs), representatives of the seven barley chromosomes. Ninety-five alleles were detected among all the barley accessions. For 22 polymorphic eSSRs, the number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 12, with a mean of 4.318 alleles per locus. The lowest and the largest number of alleles per locus among the seven homeologous groups was observed in homeologous group 5H and 4H with 3.00 and 6.33, respectively. The gene diversity increased as the number of alleles increased. Gene diversity for 22 ESTs loci varied from 0.137 for GBM1404 to 0.896 for GBM1015 with an average of 0.563. A significant correlation coefficient between gene diversity and the number of alleles was high, r = 0.741 (P < 0.01). Cluster analysis was conducted based on eSSRs data to group the barley genotypes and to construct a dendrogram. Four groups can be distinguished by truncating the dendrogram at gs value of 0.77.

AB The objectives of this study were to identify RAPD and ISSR markers linked to northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) resistant genes in F2 population of maize using bulked segregant analysis and to map NCLB resistance genes in F2 populations of maize. The F2 white population of maize was developed from a cross between the resistant line Sd-63 and the susceptible line Sd-7. Bulked segregant analysis with RAPD and ISSR markers was conducted to identify markers that were linked to the Ht1 gene. The linkage relationship between the RAPD markers (Pr11(180bp), Pr11(300bp) and OPB08(290bp)) and northern corn leaf blight resistance (NCLB) Ht1 gene were estimated using F2 population derived from the cross Sd63 x Sd7. The genetic distances between RAPD markers (Pr11(180bp), Pr11(300bp) and OPB08(290bp)) and NCLB resistance Ht1 gene were determined to be 25.4, 17.5 and 9.6 cM, respectively, with LOD scores of 38.9, 38.5 and 56.5, respectively. Therefore, RAPD markers (Pr11(180bp), Pr11(300bp) and OPB08(290bp)) were linked to the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for (NCLB) resistance Ht1 gene. The genetic distance between ISSR markers (AD1(820bp) and AD6(650bp)) and NCLB resistance Ht1 gene were determined to be 7.4 and 3.3 cM, respectively, with LOD scores of 49.1 and 51.8, respectively. Therefore, ISSR markers (AD1(820bp), and AD6(650bp) were linked to the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for NCLB resistance Ht1 gene. The present study indicated that RAPD and ISSR markers, combined with bulked segregant analysis, could be used to identify molecular markers linked to NCLB resistance gene in maize. Once these markers are identified, they can be used in maize breeding programs, as a selection tool in early generations.

AB Fusarium asiaticum is the predominant causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in southern China. The genetic diversity was assessed by analyzing 448 single-spore F. asiaticum isolates from 18 sampling sites that were 10 to 2,000 kin apart, using seven highly informative variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. This analysis showed a significant degree of population subdivision (P < 0.001) among populations from upper, middle, and lower valleys of the Yangtze River, with little gene flow (Nm = 1.210). We observed a strong association between this genetic Population subdivision and the mycotoxin produced. Our results show that the dramatic cline in trichothecene chemotypes may be explained by a recent and significant invasion of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3ADON) producers in FHB pathogen composition in the middle valley. Using Bayesian statistics, we found a biased gene flow from 3ADON to nivalenol (NIV) Populations. In addition, we observed significant genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium between NIV- and 3ADON-producing isolates at the same sampling sites. The impact of the changed agronomy and trade of cereal commodities on the spread of the new Fusarium population and the consequent increase of FHB observed in southern China are discussed.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is the most prevalent and widespread disease of wheat in South America. The objective of this study was to determine whether genetically differentiated groups of P triticina are currently present in South America and to compare the South American population with the previously characterized Population ill North America. In total, 130 isolates of R triticina from the wheat-growing regions of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru. and Uruguay, mostly from the 1990s to 2008, were tested for virulence on 20 lines of wheat with single genes for leaf rust resistance and for molecular genotypes with 23 simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. After removal of isolates with identical virulence and SSR genotypes, 99 isolates were included for further analysis. Principal coordinate analysis plots indicated five different groups of isolates based on SSR genotypes that also differed for virulence to leaf rust resistance genes. All pairs of groups, except for one pair, were significantly differentiated for SSR genotypes according to R(ST) statistics. All but two pairs of groups were significantly differentiated for virulence phenotype according to Phi(PT) statistics. Isolates in all five groups had high values of fixation index for SSR alleles and linkage disequilibrium was high across all isolates that indicated the clonal reproduction of urediniospores. Only one of the five P. triticina groups from South America was differentiated for SSR genotypes from all of the six P triticina groups from North America. The high degree of similarity for SSR genotype of isolates from both South America and North America Suggested a common European origin of P. triticina that was introduced to both continents. The emergence of the same P. triticina virulence phenotypes with highly related SSR genotypes in the United States in 1996 and in Uruguay in 1999 indicated the likely intercontinental migration of these genotypes from Mexico to both South America and North America.

AB The Streptomyces phage phiC31 integrase was tested for its ability to excise transgenic DNA from the wheat genome by site-specific recombination. Plants that stably express phiC31 integrase were crossed to plants carrying a target construct bearing the phiC31 recognition sites, attP and attB. In the progeny, phiC31 recombinase mediates recombination between the att sites of the target locus, which results in excision of the intervening DNA. Recombination events could be identified in 34 independent wheat lines by PCR and Southern blot analysis and by sequencing of the excision footprints. Recombinant loci were inherited to the subsequent generation. The results presented here establish the integrase-att system as a tool for catalysing the precise elimination of DNA sequences from wheat chromosomes.

AB Crown rot (CR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a chronic wheat disease in Australia. As part of our objective of improving the efficiency of breeding CR resistant wheat varieties, we have been searching for novel sources of resistance. This paper reports on the genetic control of one of these newly identified resistant genotypes, 'CSCR6'. A population derived from a cross between CSCR6 and an Australian variety 'Lang' was analyzed using two Fusarium isolates belonging to two different species, one Fusarium pseudograminearum and the other Fusarium graminearum. The two isolates detected QTL with the same chromosomal locations and comparable magnitudes, indicating that CR resistance is not species-specific. The resistant allele of one of the QTL was derived from 'CSCR6'. This QTL, designated as Qcrs.cpi-3B, was located on the long arm of chromosome 3B and explains up to 48.8% of the phenotypic variance based on interval mapping analysis. Another QTL, with resistant allele from the variety 'Lang', was located on chromosome 4B. This QTL explained up to 22.8% of the phenotypic variance. A strong interaction between Qcsr.cpi-3B and Qcsr.cpi-4B was detected, reducing the maximum effect of Qcrs.cpi-3B to 43.1%. The effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were further validated in four additional populations and the presence of this single QTL reduced CR severity by up to 42.1%. The fact that significant effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were detected across all trials with different genetic backgrounds and with the use of isolates belonging to two different Fusarium species make it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) involved in its resistance.

AB The use of transgenic crops is steadily increasing around the world, led by soybean (based on total area) and maize (in terms of total number of countries). Transgenic maize is grown in at least 17 countries across four continents: Africa, America, Asia and Europe. The comprehensive global spread of transgenic maize has significant implications for organizations involved in germplasm conservation and genetic enhancement; particularly as some countries require a GMO-free declaration when receiving shipments of maize germplasm. This article describes the protocol used by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) for monitoring unintentional transgene flow in maize genebank and breeding plots. The protocol is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers for detecting specific recombinant DNA sequences in bulked samples collected from sentinel plots. To date, no unintentional transgene flow has been detected in CIMMYT fields of maize genebank accessions or breeding materials.

To track the two powdery mildew resistance genes in wheat breeding program by marker assisted selection (MAS), a linked molecular marker was developed in this study. Wheat gene chip hybridization combined with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to develop an sequence-tagged sites (STS) marker for PmLK906 and Pm4. A new 2 125 bp full-length cDNA clone (GenBank accession no. EU082094) similar to csAtPR5 of Aegilops tauschii was isolated from Lankao 90(6) 21-12, and temporarily named TaAetPR5. Specific products could be amplified from cultivars or lines possessing Pm4a, Pm4b and PmLK906 with primers p9-7p1 and p9-7p2 derived from TaAetPR5. TaAetPR5 was linked to PmLK906 at a genetic distance of 7.62 cM, and cosegregated with Pm4a. The p9-7p1 and p9-7p2 could be used as an STS marker for these resistance genes in wheat breeding. Because this marker was cosegregated with Pm4a, it can be used in map-based cloning of the alleles at Pm4 locus also.

AB A genetic cross between Oryza isolate Y93-164a-1 and Eleusine isolate SA98-4 was established, and the pathogenicity of 151 F(1) progeny isolates was investigated on both host plants rice and finger millet. Results showed that the segregation of pathogenicity in this genetic cross was abnormal, i.e., most of the progeny isolates were nonpathogenic on both host plants. However, no abnormal segregation was observed when middle repetitive sequence MGR586 and 31 single-copy RFLP markers from all of the chromosomes were genetically analyzed. At the same time, comparison of the chromosomal organization among two pairs of parental isolates did not find any genomic abnormity. These results suggested that the "abnormal" inheritance of pathogenicity in this cross was most likely due to the reassortment of numerous host species specificity genes but not the biased segregation of the host species specificity genes. The host species specificities in M. grisea were likely to be multigenically controlled, at least in the genetic cross involving rice pathogen and the grasses pathogen other than rice.

AB Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] is a major threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the eastern United States. Cultivar releases containing major Hessian fly resistance genes have proven effective in minimizing losses caused by this pest. Nevertheless, the ephemeral nature of major gene resistance necessitates the identification of novel sources of resistance. Hessian fly resistance from Aegilops tauschii Coss. (2n = 2x = 14; genome DD) was introgressed into the genetic background of the soft red winter wheat cultivar Saluda during the development of the germplasm line NC09MDD14. Our genetic characterization and linkage mapping studies showed that resistance to Hessian Fly biotype L in NC09MDD14 was monogenic and the most likely order of the linked microsatellite markers was: Xcfd13- 4.2 cM-Xcfd42-1.8cM-Xgdm141-4.9cM-Xgdm36-1.5 cM- NC09MDD14 Hf gene/Xcfd132- 13.4 cM- Xcfd19. This linkage map situated the NCD-09MDD14 Hf gene on the short arm of chromosome 6D, within the same deletion bin as the named gene H13. No recombinants between H13 and the NCD-09MDD14 Hf gene were found in an allelism study that included 170 F(2) individuals from the cross between NCD09MDD14 and Molly (H13). The Hessian fly resistance gene present in the germplasm line NC09MDD14 could be an allele of H13, but unlike H13, the gene in NC09MDD14 provides resistance against biotype vrH13.

AB Sharon goatgrass (Aegilops sharonensis Eig) is a useful source of genes for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement, but little is known about its genetic diversity in Israel. We analyzed genetic diversity and population structure of 106 Ae. sharonensis accessions. Twenty-one microsatellites revealed a high level of diversity that was comparable to Triticeae species with larger geographic distribution. The genetic structure of Ae. sharonensis is characterized by high diversity within location and by a short distance (15 km) similarity between populations. Accessions from the Sharon Plain exhibited the highest level of diversity. Because the Sharon Plain is located in the center of geographic distribution of the species and includes the three most genetically diverse sites, it may be the center of diversity of Ae. sharonensis. A wide range of variation was observed in the 11 morphological traits evaluated, and the regional effect on the phenotypic variability was higher than the one observed for genetic diversity. Considerable variability was found in response to leaf rust and stem rust among regions, as a very low frequency of resistance was found for both diseases in the northern regions of Israel. The diversity pattern found in populations of Ae. sharonensis indicate that, to optimize the capture of the greatest diversity, collection and utilization programs should include multiple individuals from as many sites as possible.

AB The stem rust resistance genes Sr24, Sr26, Sr36, and Sr1RS(Amigo) confer resistance to race TTKSK (= Ug99) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Pers. (Pgt). A collection of 776 cultivars and breeding lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from all growing regions of the United States were screened with simple sequence repeat and sequence tagged site markers linked to Sr24, Sr26, Sr36, and Sr1RS(Amigo) to determine frequencies of these genes in U.S. wheat germ-plasm. Marker efficacy in predicting the presence of these genes was evaluated via comparison with assayed seedling infection type. Among the lines evaluated, the most predominant gene is Sr24, present in hard winter, hard spring, and soft winter wheat lines. Resistance in soft winter wheat is primarily due to Sr36. The 1RS.1AL rye translocation carrying Sr1RS(Amigo) is present at equal frequencies in hard winter and soft winter wheat. Utilization of marker-assisted selection for stem rust resistance genes can hasten the development of wheat cultivars resistant to TTKSK and its variants and allow for the development of resistance gene pyramids for more durable stem rust resistance.

AB Near isogenic lines (NILs) varying for reduced height (Rht) and photoperiod insensitivity (Ppd-D1) alleles in a cv. Mercia background (rht (tall), Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1c, Rht8c+Ppd-D1a, Rht-D1c, Rht12) were compared for interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), above-ground biomass (AGB), harvest index (HI), height, weed prevalence, lodging and grain yield, at one field site but within contrasting ('organic' vs. 'conventional') rotational and agronomic contexts, in each of 3 years. In the final year, further NILs (rht (tall), Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1c, Rht-B1b+Rht-D1b, Rht-D1b+Rht-B1c) in Maris Huntsman and Maris Widgeon backgrounds were added together with 64 lines of a doubled haploid (DH) population [Savannah (Rht-D1b) x Renesansa (Rht-8c+Ppd-D1a)]. There were highly significant genotype x system interactions for grain yield, mostly because differences were greater in the conventional system than in the organic system. Quadratic fits of NIL grain yield against height were appropriate for both systems when all NILs and years were included. Extreme dwarfing was associated with reduced PAR, RUE, AGB, HI, and increased weed prevalence. Intermediate dwarfing was often associated with improved HI in the conventional system, but not in the organic system. Heights in excess of the optimum for yield were associated particularly with reduced HI and, in the conventional system, lodging. There was no statistical evidence that optimum height for grain yield varied with system although fits peaked at 85 and 96 cm in the conventional and organic systems, respectively. Amongst the DH lines, the marker for Ppd-D1a was associated with earlier flowering, and just in the conventional system also with reduced PAR, AGB and grain yield. The marker for Rht-D1b was associated with reduced height, and again just in the conventional system, with increased HI and grain yield. The marker for Rht8c reduced height, and in the conventional system only, increased HI. When using the System x DH line means as observations grain yield was associated with height and early vegetative growth in the organic system, but not in the conventional system. In the conventional system, PAR interception after anthesis correlated with yield. Savannah was the highest yielding line in the conventional system, producing significantly more grain than several lines that out yielded it in the organic system.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a significant problem. Introgression of genes controlling grain dormancy into white-grained bread wheat is one means of improving resistance to PHS. In this study seven dormant (containing the SW95-50213 and AUS1408 sources) x non-dormant crosses were produced to investigate the effectiveness of selection for grain dormancy in early segregating generations. Each generation (F(1)-F(4)) was grown in a temperature controlled glasshouse with an extended photoperiod (i.e. continuous light). F(2) and F(3) generations were subject to selection. Five hundred harvest-ripe grains were tested for germination over a 14 day period, and the 100 most dormant grains were retained and grown-on to produce the next generation within each cross. The response to selection was assessed through analysis of the time to 50% germination (G(50)) in the F(2), F(3) and F(4) generations. In addition, changes in marker class frequencies for two SSR markers (barc170 and gpw2279) flanking a known quantitative trait locus (QTL) for grain dormancy on chromosome 4A were assessed in DNA from F(2) plants selected from early germinating (non-dormant) and late germinating (dormant) phenotypic extremes within each cross. Selection for grain dormancy in the F(2) and F(3) generations effectively recovered the dormant phenotype in all seven crosses, i.e. the F(4) generation was not significantly different from the dormant parent. Further, selection based on individual F(2) grains changed marker class frequencies for the 4A dormancy QTL; in most cases eliminating the marker class homozygous for the non-dormant alleles. Application of this screening method will enable breeders to better select for grain dormancy and may lead to development of new cultivars offering effective resistance to PHS in the near future.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in wheat throughout the world. FHB resistance consists of two components: resistance to initial infection (type I) and resistance to spread within infected spikes (type II). Current wheat breeding programs for FHB focus on type II resistance, which limits pathogen spread but may not be sufficiently durable. To combine type I with existing type II resistance, 113 F(9)-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from a cross between three wheat genotypes Frontana, W9207, and Alsen. The RILs were evaluated for resistance to initial infection, FHB spread within spike, kernel damage, and deoxynivalenol (DON) content in two independent greenhouse experiments in 2006 and 2007. Among the 113 RILs, 20% lines showed a parts per thousand currency sign10% initial disease severity (IDS) and a parts per thousand currency sign11 to 30% final disease severity (FDS), and 19% had DON content a parts per thousand currency sign5 mu g/g. Approximately 11% of the RILs showed tendency of higher resistance (as exhibited by lower IDS, FDS, and DON content) than the resistant parents. The 42 of the FHB-resistant RILs were analyzed with seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers or microsatellites known to be linked to FHB resistance. Approximately half of the RILs had molecular markers linked to both types of FHB resistance indicated the presence of type I and II resistance alleles in the RILs. The resistant RILs identified in this study should be useful for the future improvement of FHB resistance in spring wheat.

AB Two hundred and seventy-three CIMMYT bread wheat cultivars and advanced lines grown under irrigated conditions in Mexico during the 2005-06 Yaqui crop cycle were characterized for quality-related genetic traits using gene-specific markers for some high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS and LMW-GS) genes, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phytoene synthase (PSY), and waxy genes. Of them, 142 were analyzed for quality parameters including SDS sedimentation volume (SDS-SV), dough mixing time, and Alveograph parameters, and for HMW-GS and LMW-GS compositions using sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). For the Ppo-A1 locus tested with the marker PPO18, the frequencies of alleles Ppo-A1a and Ppo-A1b were 79.1 and 20.2%, respectively, and no PCR fragment was amplified in 2 lines (0.73%), whereas 227 lines (83.2%) contained the allele Ppo-D1a and 46 lines (16.8%) had Ppo-D1b detected by markers PPO16 and PPO29. For the marker YP7A, 142 lines (52.0%) were assumed to have the allele Psy-A1a and 131 lines (48.0%) contained the allele Psy-A1b. In the case of the marker YP7B for the gene Psy-B1, the alleles Psy-B1a and Psy-B1b were detected in 155 (56.8%) and 43 (15.8%) lines, respectively, and 75 (27.4%) lines possessed the allele Psy-B1d detected by the marker YP7B-3. All 273 lines contained the alleles Wx-A1a and Wx-D1a as determined by markers MAG264 and MAG269, respectively. Using the marker Wx-B1, 204 lines (74.7%) were presumed to have the Wx-B1a allele and 69 (25.3%) possessed Wx-B1b. The over-expressing allele of Bx7 (OE) and subunit By8*, not clearly seen with SDS-PAGE, were detected by RP-HPLC. The numbers of lines with subunits Ax2*, By8, By9, Bx17, Bx20, Dx5, and Glu-B3j were 90, 16, 57, 5, 46, 118, and 33, respectively, in the 142 lines analyzed with molecular markers, and were consistent with the results obtained by SDS-PAGE, except for one line with the 1A.1R translocation. Subunits Ax1 and Ax2* at the Glu-A1 locus showed significantly better effects on all quality parameters than subunit Null. Subunits 5 + 10 gave significantly better effects for all parameters. Subunit Glu-A3b showed more positive effects than its alternative alleles on SDS-SV and SDS-sedimentation volume/protein content index (SPI). The allele Glu-B3g showed the best effect on SDS-SV and Alveograph W, whereas Glu-B3j, associated with the 1B.1R translocation, exhibited a strongly negative effect on all quality parameters.

AB Markers targeting intron length polymorphism of resistance gene analogues (RGA-ILP) are not only expected to be more polymorphic than those designed from conserved exons, but also have potential resistance gene function. Based on known domains of resistance genes, more than 900 wheat RGAs were mined from public databases. Two hundred and seventy-eight intron-containing RGA candidates were predicted based on rice genomic DNA information, and 50 of them were selected for evaluation and mapping. A total of 150 RGA-ILP primer pairs, consisting of exon-primed intron-crossing primers to amplify the intronic regions of RGAs were designed. One hundred and thirty-five pairs were successfully amplified with similar or larger than expected product lengths. Three mapping populations (SOpop, NYpop and WSpop) were screened and 28 pairs of RGA-ILP primers gave reproducible polymorphic amplifications between the mapping parents. Sixteen, 14 and five loci were integrated into SOpop, NYpop and WSpop maps, respectively. The results demonstrated that this method provides an efficient approach for developing polymorphic markers.

AB Microsatellite markers were used to analyse the genetic diversity of 120 individuals of 20 weedy/wild populations of Secale cereale collected all around Iran. High levels of diversity, with an average number of seven alleles per locus (ranging up to 11) and high level polymorphism with polymorphism rate averaging 0.645 (between populations) and 0.364 (within populations) were observed. The Northwestern populations showed the highest and the Northern populations showed the lowest polymorphism and diversity. One population was notably more similar to five of the S. strictum used as outgroups. No taxon or geographic specific marker was detected, suggesting high gene flow between the populations, however some groupings which can be related to the subspecies, were evident. This survey showed the high genetic diversity within the Iranian rye genepool as an important source for crop breeders, and indicated that there is value in sampling for useful genes for crops improvement.

AB The present study was undertaken to evaluate the genetic diversity in gluten subunits and protein content in seed endosperm of wheat for nutritional grading of 60 registered Pakistani wheat varieties using SDS-PAGE and this grading is useful for agricultural development regarding food stuffs and breeding purposes. After calculating the standard factor in spectrophotometer for unit absorbance at 540 nm and the amount of protein were calculated. The wheat varieties GA-2002, C-250 and Chakwal-86 contains maximum amount of HMW-Gs proteins as compared to rest of the varieties. By comparing with the thirteen bands of the standard marker band numbers 5,9,12 and 13 were common in all sixty wheat varieties but the other bands show variation. Most frequent HMW protein bands were with mol. Wt. 110 KDa marker band, while in LMW protein bands most frequent bands were among the 14 KDa marker band. In cluster analysis the above mentioned three wheat varieties grouped in the same cluster showing that they originate from the same parental line and genetically less diverged. However, the only reason for producing variable amounts of HMW-Gs was due to the varying combinations and expression of genes in these lines. (C) 2010 Friends Science Publishers

AB The Hardness locus on the short arm of chromosome 5D is the main determinant of grain texture in bread wheat. The Pina and Pinb genes are tightly linked at this locus, and the soft kernel texture phenotype results when both genes are present and encode the wild-type puroindoline proteins PINA and PINB. In this study a compensating T5VS.5DL Triticum aestivum-Haynaldia villosa translocation line, NAU415, was characterized by chromosome C-banding, genomic in situ hybridization and molecular markers. Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) analysis and scanning electron microscopy indicated that NAU415 had soft endosperm although it lacked the wheat Pina-D1a and Pinb-D1a genes, suggesting the presence of functional Pin gene orthologs on chromosome 5VS. Using a PCR approach, Pina-related (designated Dina) and Pinb-related (Dinb) genes in H. villosa and NAU415 were identified and sequenced. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences showed close similarities to the wild-type puroindolines of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The tryptophan-rich regions of both Dina and Dinb showed a sequence change from lysine-42 to arginine, a feature that may have an effect on grain texture. The potential of T5VS.5DL translocation line as a source of genes that may be used for modulation of endosperm texture and other valuable traits in wheat breeding is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fusarium head blight or scab resistance in wheat is a complex quantitative trait affected greatly by environments. Therefore, the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for scab resistance found in mapping projects require validation to be effectively utilized in breeding programs. In this study, by employing both forward and background selections with the help of molecular markers, near-isogenic lines (NILs) for scab resistance QTLs Qfh.nau-2B, Qfhs.nau-3B, Qfhi.nau-4B and Qfhi.nau-5A, three of which originating in scab resistance germplasm Wangshuibai, were developed with the elite line Miangyang 99-323 as the recurrent parent. During the process of backcross, selection was based solely on marker genotypes of the target regions, and on recipient genome recovery rate in BC(2)F(1) and BC(3)F(1). All the identified BC(3)F(1) plants with the target QTL regions have more than 94% recipient genome composition (RGC), and out of four to five of them a plant with over 97% RGC were obtained in each backcross combination. Compared with Mianyang 99-323, the Qfhs.nau-3B NIL showed much better resistance to disease spread within spikes, the Qfhi.nau-4B and Qfhi.nau-5A NILs showed much better resistance to initial infection, and the Qfh.nau-2B NIL showed improvement in both types of resistance. These results were consistent with findings in the previous QTL mapping studies. Morphologically and agronomically these NILs were similar to Mianyang 99-323 except that Qfhi.nau-4B NIL was taller and had a longer spike, and Qfhi.nau-5A NIL had narrower leaves. These results demonstrated the feasibility of marker-assisted utilization of scab resistance QTLs.

AB Wheat pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an undesired trait, which often reduces yield and downgrades end-use quality of grain. Viviparous-1B (Vp-1B), a regulator gene located on chromosome 3B, has previously been proved to be involved in inducing grain dormancy of wheat. In order to obtain some new or useful alleles associated with PHS tolerance of white-grained wheat, we developed a gene-specific marker (Vp1-b2) to identify allelic variations of Vp-1B using denaturing PAGE in micro-core collections of Chinese wheat and landraces. As a main component observed genetic variation for PHS, seed dormancy evaluated by germination index (GI) was determined at dough-yellow ripening stage in the present study. The results indicated that six alleles of Vp-1B, in our study, were discovered among 276 Chinese wheat varieties. Of these alleles, two variants were validated to be novel alleles and designated as Vp-1Be and Vp-1Bf, respectively. By investigating the association between allelic variations of Vp-1B and seed dormancy, we found allele of Vp-1Ba always inclined to weak seed dormancy and susceptibility to PHS. Up to 62.2% genotypes carrying the allele had high GI value with a range of 0.51-1.00, only 14.4% genotypes had low GI value under 0.30. On the contrary, other variants such as Vp-1Bb, Vp-1Bc, Vp-1Bd, Vp-1Be and Vp-1Bf mostly occurred in varieties with higher PHS tolerance, which average of GI values were 0.204, 0.227, 0.296, 0.256 and 0.186, respectively. In Chinese wheat germplasms, Vp-1Ba and Vp-1Bc showed the most widespread distribution followed by Vp-1Bb; other alleles fell into less used varieties.

AB Retrotransposons constitute a major proportion of the Triticeae genomes. Genome-scale studies have revealed their role in evolution affecting both genome structure and function and their potential for the development of novel markers. In this study, family members of an LTR copia retrotransposon which mediated the duplication of the gene encoding the high molecular weight glutenin subunit Bx7 in cultivar Glenlea were characterized. This novel element was named Sasanda_EU157184-1 (TREP3516). High density filters of the Glenlea hexaploid wheat BAC library were screened with a Sasanda long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific probe and similar to 1,075 positive clones representing an estimated copy number of 347 elements per haploid genome were identified. The 242 BAC clones with the strongest hybridization signal were selected. To maximize isolation of complete elements, this subset of clones was screened with a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain probe and DNA was isolated from the 133 clones that produced a strong hybridization signal. Left (5') and right (3') LTRs as well as the RT domains were PCR amplified and sequencing was carried out on the final subset of 121 clones. Evolutionary relationships were inferred from a data set consisting of 100 RT, 102 5' LTR and 100 3' LTR sequences representing 233, 451 and 495 informative sites for comparison, respectively. Neighbour-joining tree indicated that the element is at least 1.8 million years old and has evolved into a minimum of five sub-families. The insertion times of the 89 complete elements were estimated based on the divergence between their LTRs. Corroborating the inference from the RT domain, analysis of the LTR domains also indicated bursts of amplification from 2.6 million years ago (MYA) to now, except for one member dated to 4.6 +/- A 0.7 MYA, which corresponds to the interval of divergence of Triticum and Aegilops (3 MYA) and divergence of Triticum and Rye (7 MYA). In 44 elements, the 5' and 3' LTRs were identical indicating recent transposition activity. The element can be used to develop retrotransposon-based markers such as sequence-specific amplified polymorphism, retrotransposon microsatellite amplified polymorphism and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism, all of which are well suited for genotyping studies.

AB The evolution of plant breeding is a classic example of how improved biological understanding has been adapted to provide more effective methods of meeting the demands of a changing world. Plant biotechnology offers significant improvements in virtually every area of crop production and utilisation, with potential benefits to farmers, the food industry, consumers and the environment. Recent progress in plant genomics has allowed us to discover and isolate important genes and to analyze functions that regulate yields and tolerance to environmental stress.
   Based on the traditional plant breeding achievements, this review was focused on the recent trends and potential plant of biotechnology and genomics. We summarized some global strategies for radically rethinking agriculture for the 21(st) century. Briefly, we exposed the main lines and ideas for modern agricultural improvement based on the reports of the European Plant Science Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization and The Royal Society. Unfortunately, in this review we couldn't cover all aspects of the future challenges of plant biotechnology and genomics. But, we underlined some hot points, trying to direct the attention to new approaches, new methods, new technology indeed, perhaps even new crops and new agricultural systems.

AB Background: Epimedium sagittatum (Sieb. Et Zucc.) Maxim, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant species, has been used extensively as genuine medicinal materials. Certain Epimedium species are endangered due to commercial overexploition, while sustainable application studies, conservation genetics, systematics, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Epimedium is less-studied due to the lack of molecular markers. Here, we report a set of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified in these ESTs for E. sagittatum.
   Results: cDNAs of E. sagittatum are sequenced using 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology. The raw reads are cleaned and assembled into a total of 76,459 consensus sequences comprising of 17,231 contigs and 59,228 singlets. About 38.5% (29,466) of the consensus sequences significantly match to the non-redundant protein database (E-value < 1e-10), 22,295 of which are further annotated using Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A total of 2,810 EST-SSRs is identified from the Epimedium EST dataset. Trinucleotide SSR is the dominant repeat type (55.2%) followed by dinucleotide (30.4%), tetranuleotide (7.3%), hexanucleotide (4.9%), and pentanucleotide (2.2%) SSR. The dominant repeat motif is AAG/CTT (23.6%) followed by AG/CT (19.3%), ACC/GGT (11.1%), AT/AT (7.5%), and AAC/GTT (5.9%). Thirty-two SSR-ESTs are randomly selected and primer pairs are synthesized for testing the transferability across 52 Epimedium species. Eighteen primer pairs (85.7%) could be successfully transferred to Epimedium species and sixteen of those show high genetic diversity with 0.35 of observed heterozygosity (Ho) and 0.65 of expected heterozygosity (He) and high number of alleles per locus (11.9).
   Conclusion: A large EST dataset with a total of 76,459 consensus sequences is generated, aiming to provide sequence information for deciphering secondary metabolism, especially for flavonoid pathway in Epimedium. A total of 2,810 EST-SSRs is identified from EST dataset and similar to 1580 EST-SSR markers are transferable. E. sagittatum EST-SSR transferability to the major Epimedium germplasm is up to 85.7%. Therefore, this EST dataset and EST-SSRs will be a powerful resource for further studies such as taxonomy, molecular breeding, genetics, genomics, and secondary metabolism in Epimedium species.

AB The genetic diversity of 116 barley accessions, representing five Chinese eco-geographic populations, was studied using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The 21 SSR loci revealed 128 alleles with an average of 6.1 alleles per locus. The highest values of proportion of polymorphic loci (P) and gene diversity index (He) were obtained in the Northern (P = 1.00; He = 0.60) and the Yangtze River reaches and Southern populations (P = 1.00; He = 0.59). The lowest values were in the populations of the Yellow River reaches (P = 0.86; He = 0.44). The highest average number of alleles per locus (4.52) and number of unique alleles (7) were found in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau population. Cluster analysis revealed that together with the row type, strong eco-geographic variables influenced the classification. Associations of SSR and eco-geographic values were established for 11 SSR loci. Four to six markers were found to discriminate among geographic groups, which may serve as tools for diagnosis of the eco-geographic populations and provide evidence for the adaptive nature of SSR markers.

AB Genetic diversity and population structure of 15 wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) populations from Israel were detected by 30 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) primer pairs. Two hundred and forty four fragments out of 438 were polymorphic. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P), the genetic diversity (He), and Shannon's information index were 0.557, 0.198, and 0.295, respectively. The population Amirim had the highest genetic variation, whereas the Population of Tabigha had the lowest genetic variation. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that most of the variation was presented within populations. The value of genetic distance (D) between the Populations varied from 0.027 to 0.165 with an average of 0.079, and the estimates of genetic distance were geographically independent based on the Mantel test (r = 0.105, P = 0.168). A total of 30 significant (P < 0.05) correlations were detected between 14 SRAP loci and 12 ecogeographic factors. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several species of the genus Aegilops, wild relatives of wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) carry gametocidal (Gc) genes. Gc genes kill the gametes without themselves by causing chromosomal breakage during postmeiotic cell divisions, and therefore are strong segregation distorters. The Gc gene Gc3-C1 derived from chromosome 3C of Ae. triuncialis (2n = 4x = 28, CCUU) induces chromosomal breakage in wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring' (CS) but not in cultivar 'Norin 26' (N26). This cultivar-specific inhibition of Gc function is caused by a suppressor gene Igc1 located on chromosome 3B of N26. Igc1 is presumed to be a modified Gc gene without breakage function because of its homoeology to Gc3-C1. Here we report the results of linkage and physical mapping of Igc1 to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Gc action. Segregation analysis of the phenotypic data in BC1F1 mapping population of the cross between (CSxN26)F-1 and CS + 3C" showed a 1:1 segregation ratio indicating that Igc1 is a dominant gene. In the linkage analysis, three molecular marker loci Xgwm285, Xgwm376, and Xcfp1886 cosegregated with the Igc1 locus. Bin mapping assigned the loci Xgwm285 and Xcfp1886 to bin C-3BS1-0.33 and Xgwm376 to bin C-3BL2-0.22. Physical mapping using Gc-induced chromosomal deletion lines of chromosome 3B of N26 revealed that the Igc1 locus resides in 52.0% or 2.1% of bins C-3BS1-0.33 and C-3BL2-0.22, respectively. Pericentromeric localization of Igc1 in chromosome 3B of N26 may have a positive effect to keep the two-component system of the Gc action. Map-based cloning approach to isolate the Igc1 may be difficult because recombination is depleted in the pericentromeric region. As is shown in this study, the combination of genetic and physical mapping offers high efficiency to identify the regions where genes are located especially in regions with low levels of recombination.

ID BREAD WHEAT; RICE; GENE; MAP; EPISTASIS
AB Epistasis underlying fertility plays an important role in crop breeding. Although a new female sterile mutant in wheat, XND126, has been identified and a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), taf1, for the female sterility has been mapped, the genetic architecture of the female sterility needs to be further addressed. To identify the interaction involving the gene(s) controlling the female sterility, an investigation was carried out for the seed setting ratio in an F(2) population derived from the cross between XND126 and Gaocheng 8901. Among 1250 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs in the whole genome, a total of 21 markers, obtained by recessive class approach, along with other ten tightly linked markers on reference maps in wheat, were used to survey 243 F2 individuals. As a result, 28 markers were mapped into five genetic linkage groups. The performance for female sterility for each F2 individual was evaluated simultaneously at the Urumqi and Huai'an experimental stations in 2006-2007. The two phenotypic datasets along with marker information were jointly analysed in the detection of QTL using penalized maximum likelihood approach. A total of six QTLs, including two main-effect QTLs, three epistatic QTLs and one environmental interaction and accounting for 0.67-24.55% of the total phenotypic variance, were identified. All estimated effects accounted for 53.26% of the total phenotypic variation. The taf1 detected in previous study was also located on the same marker interval on chromosome 2DS. These results enrich our understanding of the genetic basis of the female sterility.

AB The Restorer-of-fertility (Rf) gene is used for efficient hybrid seed production in chili pepper. Although molecular markers linked to Rf in pepper are available, their applications have been limited by lack of agreement between marker genotype and phenotype. To overcome this limitation, we developed new molecular markers using an Rf-segregating population for which most of previously developed markers are not suitable, because of lack of polymorphism. The petunia Rf gene was used as a candidate for marker development. First of all, a pepper bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was screened using a pepper homolog of the petunia Rf gene. The 52 selected BAC clones were classified into three contig groups and each contig group was mapped to chromosome 6. Three markers were developed using the three groups; their genetic distances from the Rf locus were 1.4, 3.2 and 14 cM, respectively. In the second place, an Rf-linked marker was developed from the sequence of a tomoto BAC clone containing three genes which are homologous to petunia Rf gene. Genetic distance between this marker and Rf gene was 1.4 cM. When newly-, and previously-developed molecular markers linked to Rf were applied to 55 pepper breeding lines, one marker named CRF-SCAR was found to be the most broadly applicable, based on correct determination of phenotypes. In the present study, we demonstrate that previously cloned Rf genes can be used as candidate genes for development of new markers for the reliable detection of restorer lines. We expect that the newly-developed markers and information obtained from application of markers will be useful for reliable detection of restorer lines.

AB Selection for anthracnose disease resistance is one of the top priorities in white lupin (Lupinus albus) breeding programs. A cross was made between a landrace P27174 (resistant to anthracnose) and a cultivar Kiev Mutant (susceptible). The progeny was advanced to F(8) recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Disease tests on the RIL population from field trials over 2 years indicated that the disease resistance in P27174 was polygenic controlled. A modified selective genotyping strategy was applied in the development of molecular markers linked to quantitative loci conferring anthracnose diseases resistance. Eight individual plants representing high level of anthracnose resistance (HR), eight plants representing susceptibility (S), together with eight lines representing medium level of anthracnose resistance (MR), were subjected to DNA fingerprinting by Microsatellite-anchored Fragment Length Polymorphisms (MFLP). Six MFLP polymorphisms, which had the banding pattern matching the HR plants and the S plants, were identified as candidate markers linked to quantitative loci conferring anthracnose resistance. The six candidate MFLP markers were delineated into three groups based on their banding variation on the eight MR plants. One candidate MFLP marker each from the three groups was selected, cloned, sequenced, and converted into co-dominant, sequence-specific PCR markers. These three markers, designated as WANR1, WANR2 and WANR3, were tested on a segregating population containing 189 F(8) RILs. The disease phenotyping data and the marker genotyping data on the F(8) RILs were merged and analysed by the JMP software using the 'fit-model' function, which revealed that 71% of the phenotypic variation was controlled by genetic factors, while the other 29% of the phenotypic variation was due to environmental factors and environment x genotype interactions. On individual marker basis, marker WANR1 conditioned 39% of phenotypic variations of anthracnose resistance, followed by marker WANR2 with 8%, and WANR3 with 12%. Further analysis showed that WANR2 and WANR3 were on the same linkage group with a genetic distance of 15.3 cM. The combination of the two markers WANR1 and WANR3 explained 51% out from the 71% of the genetic controlled variations for disease resistance, indicating that the two QTLs working additively for anthracnose disease resistance. A simulation of marker-assisted selection on the F(8) RIL population using the two markers WANR1 and WANR3 identified 42 out of the 189 RILs being homozygous for resistance-allele bands for both markers, and 41 of them showed disease severity below 3.0 on the 1 (highly resistant) to 5 (susceptible) scale. The two markers WANR1 and WANR3 have now been implemented for marker-assisted selection for anthracnose resistance in the L. albus breeding program in Australia.

AB Ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) catalysis three steps in the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway, which yields a large hormone family affecting plant growth and development. In the current study, we performed partial gene cloning and comparative structural and mapping analysis among three Kao genes in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Molecular-marker-based mapping demonstrated that the Kao loci map to the distal ends of the chromosome arms 7AS, 4AL and 7DS, corresponding to the 7BS/4AL translocation region. Co-linearity of the chromosomal regions carrying the Kao genes was shown. It was concluded that the Kao genes we mapped represent a homoeoloci set, therefore the genes were designated Kao-A1 (chromosome 7AS), Kao-B1 (4AL), and Kao-D1 (7DS). It was found that exonic sequences of the three homoeologues differ from each other mainly by silent mutations, and each homoeologue is expressed.

   EXPRESSION
AB Ppd-D1 is one of the most potent genes affecting the photoperiod response of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Only two alleles, insensitive Ppd-D1a and sensitive Ppd-D1b, were known previously, and these did not adequately explain the broad adaptation of wheat to photoperiod variation.
   In this study, five diagnostic molecular markers were employed to identify Ppd-D1 haplotypes in 492 wheat varieties from diverse geographic locations and 55 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor species of wheat.
   Six Ppd-D1 haplotypes, designated I-VI, were identified. Types II, V and VI were considered to be more ancient and types I, III and IV were considered to be derived from type II. The transcript abundances of the Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed continuous variation, being highest for haplotype I, lowest for haplotype III, and correlating negatively with varietal differences in heading time. These haplotypes also significantly affected other agronomic traits. The distribution frequency of Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed partial correlations with both latitudes and altitudes of wheat cultivation regions.
   The evolution, expression and distribution of Ppd-D1 haplotypes were consistent evidentially with each other. What was regarded as a pair of alleles in the past can now be considered a series of alleles leading to continuous variation.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB The major limit to plant growth in acid soils is the presence of toxic aluminum (Al) cations, which limit growth by inhibiting root elongation. Aluminum tolerance in rye is controlled by (at least) four independent loci (Alt1, Alt2, Alt3 and Alt4) located on chromosome arms 6RS, 3RS, 4RL and 7RS, respectively. In this work, we analyzed several F(2) populations in which two different Alt loci were segregating. We constructed a map of chromosome 7R, which contains the Alt4 locus and microsatellite and PCR-markers (B1, B4, B11, B26 and BCD1230). These markers were mapped to the S arm of 7R using wheat-rye addition lines. Our results show that all these markers are linked to the Alt4 locus already known to be on 7RS. In addition, the OPS14 (705) RAPD marker was linked to the Alt3 locus using bulked segregant analysis. This RAPD marker was transformed into a SCAR (ScOPS14 (705) ) and was localized to arm 4RL using wheat-rye addition lines. Finally, this SCAR was linked to the Alt3 locus at a genetic distance of 23.4 cM. In light of the current findings, and taking into account the synteny relationships in cereals, we propose candidate Alt3 and Alt4 orthologues in other cereals.

AB In wheat, the deployment of marker-assisted selection has long been hampered by the lack of markers compatible with high-throughput cost-effective genotyping techniques Recently, insertion site-based polymorphism (ISBP) markers have appeared as very powerful new tools for genomics and genetic studies in hexaploid wheat To demonstrate their possible use in wheat breeding programmes, we assessed their potential to meet the five main requirements for utilization in MAS flexible and high-throughput detection methods, low quantity and quality of DNA required, low cost per assay, tight link to target loci: and high level of polymorphism in breeding material Toward this aim, we developed a programme, IsbpFinder for the automated design of ISBP markers and adapted three detection methods (melting curve analysis, SNaPshot(R) Multiplex System and Illumina BeadArray technology) for high throughput and flexible detection of ISBP or ISBP-derived SNP markers We demonstrate that the high level of polymorphism of the ISBPs combined with cost-effective genotyping methods can be used to efficiently saturate genetic maps, discriminate between elite cultivars, and design tightly linked diagnostic markers for virtually all target loci in the wheat genome All together, our results suggest that ISBP markers have the potential to lead to a breakthrough in wheat marker-assisted selection

AB Lolium perenne L. (perennial ryegrass), and Lolium multiflorum Lam. (annual or Italian ryegrass), differ in several traits related to seed yield. Generally, L. multiflorum spikes are larger than L. perenne spikes, and have more spikelets, more florets per spikelet, larger seeds and awns. The greater number of spikelets and florets and larger seeds are associated with higher seed yield in L. multiflorum. Ryegrass (Lolium sp.) cultivars are produced by seed multiplication and understanding the genetics of seed production traits would aid in plant improvement. A total of 30 QTL for seed production related traits were identified in this study. The QTLs were primarily located on linkage groups 2 and 4 which appear to be the most important for distinguishing L. multiflorum and L. perenne. These QTL will be used to develop molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding and screening of L. perenne seed lots to detect seed contamination with L. multiflorum.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most devastating diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). With the objective of identifying and tagging a new gene for resistance to stripe rust in wheat line P81, F(1), F(2) and F(2:3) populations from the cross 'Chuanmai 28'/P81 were inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR32 in greenhouse and field trials. P81 carried a single dominant gene for resistance ( designated YrP81) to CYR32. Tests of allelism showed that YrP81 was different from Yr5, Yr10, Yr15 and Yr26. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and resistance gene-analogue polymorphism (RGAP) between the parents were used for genotyping the F(2) populations. YrP81 was closely linked to four SSR loci on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 18.3 cM (Xwmc25), 1.8 cM (Xgwm429), 4.1 cM (Xwmc770) and 5.3 cM (Xgwm148). Two RGAP markers RGA1 (NLRR/XLRR) and RGA2 (Pto kin4/NLRR-INV2) were also closely linked to YrP81 with genetic distances of 4.7 and 6.3 cM, respectively. The linkage map of YrP81 and molecular markers was established in the order Xwmc25-RGA2-RGA1-Xgwm429-YrP81-Xwmc770-Xgwm148. Pedigree analysis, response patterns with Chinese PST races and associations with markers suggested that YrP81 is a novel stripe rust resistance gene. The PCR-based microsatellite and RGAP markers identified here could be applied in selection of YrP81 in wheat breeding.

AB The aim of this study was to give a comparative overview of diversity in Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), the take-all plant pathogenic fungus. For this, 98 Ggt isolates of a worldwide collection were first compared with two sets of specific PCR tools that discriminate G(1)/G(2) and A/B genetic groups. A correspondence was found between G(1) and B on the one hand and between G(2) and A on the other, and less frequent divergent genotypes were also found. For more insight into Ggt diversity, a deeper phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the DNA sequences of two regions: the coding region of the RAPD-PCR marker previously selected and used for genotyping G(1)/G(2) isolates, corresponding to the gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase-like gene, and the rDNA region corresponding to a part of the 18S gene, 5.8S gene, ITS1 and ITS2 DNA sequences. The distribution of Ggt genotypes into two main groups was confirmed by this phylogenetic analysis. The results give some evidence of the congruence of the molecular markers used by different teams and describe for the first time at the level of a worldwide collection two major genetically different groups of Ggt. The use of a universal molecular descriptor of Ggt groups is useful for investigating the occurrence, distribution and changes in Ggt populations in relation to epidemic dynamics.

AB Barley seed proteins, Hordoindolines, are homologues of wheat Puroindolines, which are associated with grain hardness. Barley Hordoindoline genes are known to comprise Hina and Hinb, and Hinb consists of two Hinb genes, Hinb-1 and Hinb-2. Two types of allele were found for Hina, Hinb-1 and Hinb-2 genes, respectively, among Japanese two- and six-rowed barley lines. One of the alleles of Hinb-2 (Hinb-2b) had a frame-shift mutation resulting in an in-frame stop codon. For two-rowed barley lines, grain hardness was significantly higher among lines with the Hinb-2b than those with the wild type Hinb-2 gene (Hinb-2a). Protein spots corresponding to HINa, HINb-1, and HINb-2 were identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis among barley lines with Hinb-2a. Among the lines with Hinb-2b, HINa and HINb-1 were expressed at similar levels as those in the wild type, but HINb-2 was not detected. A DNA (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence) marker was developed to distinguish between the Hinb-2a and Hinb-2b gene sequences. Analysis of grain hardness among F(2) lines derived from a cross between a line with Hinb-2a (Shikoku hadaka 115) and a line with the Hinb-2b (Shikoku hadaka 84) showed significantly higher grain hardness in the mutant lines. From these results, the Hinb-2b frame-shift (null) mutation might play a critical role in barley grain hardness. The DNA marker will be useful in barley breeding to select lines having harder grain texture.

AB Natural variation in wheat requirement of long exposures to cold temperatures to accelerate flowering (vernalization) is mainly controlled by the Vrn-1, Vrn-2, Vrn-3, and Vrn-4 loci. The first three loci have been well characterized, but limited information is available for Vrn-4. So far, natural variation for Vrn-4 has been detected only in the D genome (Vrn-D4), and genetic stocks for this gene are available in Triple Dirk (TDF, hereafter). We detected heterogeneity in the Vrn-1 alleles present in different TDF stocks, which may explain inconsistencies among previous studies. A correct TDF seed stock from Japan carrying recessive vrn-A1, vrn-B1, and vrn-D1 alleles was crossed with three different winter cultivars to generate F(2) mapping populations. Most of the variation in flowering time in these three populations was controlled by a single locus, Vrn-D4, which was mapped within a 1.8 cM interval flanked by markers Xcfd78 and Xbarc205 in the centromeric region of chromosome 5D. A factorial ANOVA for heading time using Vrn-D4 alleles and vernalization as factors showed a significant interaction (P < 0.0001), which confirmed that the Vrn-D4 effect on flowering time is modulated by vernalization. Comparison of the different Triple Dirk stocks revealed that Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and Vrn-D4 all have a small residual response to vernalization, but Vrn-D4 differs from the other two in its response to short vernalization periods. The precise mapping and characterization of Vrn-D4 presented here represent a first step toward the positional cloning of this gene.

AB Allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) white clover (Trifolium repens L.) is the most commonly cultivated legume component of temperate pastures, sown in swards with a companion grass species. Genetic control of growth performance of white clover on saline land is highly important for dairy industries, due to increasing soil salinity problems. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for salinity tolerance in terms of vegetative growth under stress. Two parental genetic maps consisting of 213 and 159 marker loci and spanning 1,973.0 and 1,837.6 cM, respectively, were constructed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from a two-way pseudo-test cross F(1) population derived from pair-crossing of the Haifa(2) and LCL(2) genotypes. A total of 8 unique genomic regions on 8 linkage groups (LGs) of the Haifa(2) parental map and 6 unique regions on 5 LGs in the LCL(2) parental map were associated with plant growth under salt stress and relative growth under stress, as compared to control conditions. The results of this study indicate that salt tolerance in white clover is controlled by multiple QTLs, some at common locations, but each of limited magnitude. Location of these QTLs provides the genetic basis and potential for pyramiding of salt tolerance genes in breeding improvement.

AB Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat. A new race of the pathogen named TTKSK (syn. Ug99) and its derivatives detected in East Africa are virulent to many designated and undesignated stem rust resistance genes. The emergence and spread of those races pose an imminent threat to wheat production worldwide. Genes Sr25 and Sr26 transferred into wheat from Thinopyrum ponticum are effective against these new races. DNA markers for Sr25 and Sr26 are needed to pyramid both genes into adapted germplasm. The previously published dominant markers Gb for Sr25 and Sr26#43 for Sr26 were validated with eight wheat lines with or without Sr25 or Sr26. We tested six published STS (sequence tagged site) markers amplifying diagnostic bands of Th. ponticum. Marker BF145935 consistently amplified well and can be used as a co-dominant marker for Sr25. Among 16 STS markers developed from wheat ESTs mapped to deletion bin 6AL8-0.90-1.00, none was co-dominant for tagging Sr26. However, five 6A-specific markers were identified. Multiplex PCR with marker Sr26#43 and 6A-specific marker BE518379 can be used as a co-dominant marker for Sr26. The co-dominant markers for Sr25 and Sr26 were validated with 37 lines with known stem rust resistance genes. A diverse set of germplasm consisting 170 lines from CIMMYT, China, USA and other counties were screened with the co-dominant markers for Sr25 and Sr26. Five lines with the diagnostic fragment for Sr25 were identified, and they all have 'Wheatear' in their pedigrees, which is known to carry Sr25. None of the 170 lines tested had Sr26, as expected.

AB Background: Although rapid changes in copy number and gene order are common within plant mitochondrial genomes, associated patterns of gene transcription are underinvestigated. Previous studies have shown that the gynodioecious plant species Silene vulgaris exhibits high mitochondrial diversity and occasional paternal inheritance of mitochondrial markers. Here we address whether variation in DNA molecular markers is correlated with variation in transcription of mitochondrial genes in S. vulgaris collected from natural populations.
   Results: We analyzed RFLP variation in two mitochondrial genes, cox1 and atp1, in offspring of ten plants from a natural population of S. vulgaris in Central Europe. We also investigated transcription profiles of the atp1 and cox1 genes. Most DNA haplotypes and transcription profiles were maternally inherited; for these, transcription profiles were associated with specific mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. One individual exhibited a pattern consistent with paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA; this individual exhibited a transcription profile suggestive of paternal but inconsistent with maternal inheritance. We found no associations between gender and transcript profiles.
   Conclusions: Specific transcription profiles of mitochondrial genes were associated with specific mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in a natural population of a gynodioecious species S. vulgaris. Our findings suggest the potential for a causal association between rearrangements in the plant mt genome and transcription product variation.

TI DNA polymorphisms and haplotype patterns of transcription factors

AB Background: Association mapping is receiving considerable attention in plant genetics for its potential to fine map quantitative trait loci (QTL), validate candidate genes, and identify alleles of interest. In the present study association mapping in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is investigated by associating DNA polymorphisms with variation in grain quality traits, plant height, and flowering time to gain further understanding of gene functions involved in the control of these traits. We focused on the four loci BLZ1, BLZ2, BPBF and HvGAMYB that play a role in the regulation of B-hordein expression, the major fraction of the barley storage protein. The association was tested in a collection of 224 spring barley accessions using a two-stage mixed model approach.
   Results: Within the sequenced fragments of four candidate genes we observed different levels of nucleotide diversity. The effect of selection on the candidate genes was tested by Tajima's D which revealed significant values for BLZ1, BLZ2, and BPBF in the subset of two-rowed barleys. Pair-wise LD estimates between the detected SNPs within each candidate gene revealed different intra-genic linkage patterns. On the basis of a more extensive examination of genomic regions surrounding the four candidate genes we found a sharp decrease of LD (r2< 0.2 within 1 cM) in all but one flanking regions. Significant marker-trait associations between SNP sites within BLZ1 and flowering time, BPBF and crude protein content and BPBF and starch content were detected. Most haplotypes occurred at frequencies < 0.05 and therefore were rejected from the association analysis. Based on haplotype information, BPBF was associated to crude protein content and starch content, BLZ2 showed association to thousand-grain weight and BLZ1 was found to be associated with flowering time and plant height.
   Conclusions: Differences in nucleotide diversity and LD pattern within the candidate genes BLZ1, BLZ2, BPBF, and HvGAMYB reflect the impact of selection on the nucleotide sequence of the four candidate loci. Despite significant associations, the analysed candidate genes only explained a minor part of the total genetic variation although they are known to be important factors influencing the expression of seed quality traits. Therefore, we assume that grain quality as well as plant height and flowering time are influenced by many factors each contributing a small part to the expression of the phenotype. A genome-wide association analysis could provide a more comprehensive picture of loci involved in the regulation of grain quality, thousand grain weight and the other agronomic traits that were analyzed in this study. However, despite available high-throughput genotyping arrays the marker density along the barely genome is still insufficient to cover all associations in a whole genome scan. Therefore, the candidate gene-based approach will further play an important role in barley association studies.

AB At a molecular level, the length of the vernalization period of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is determined mainly by three loci: VRN-1, VRN-2 and VRN-3. in hexaploid wheat, the Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 genes are dominant for spring growth habit and epistatic to the alleles for winter growth habit. We used DNA markers to determine the VRN-1 genotypes of 43 common wheat cultivars from the Polish register. All of the 30 examined winter wheat cultivars carried the recessive vrn-A1 allele, and all of the 13 analyzed spring cultivars carried the dominant Vrn-A1a allele. Moreover, 13 winter and 11 spring cultivars carried the dominant Vrn-B1 allele. These results confirmed that the hexaploid wheat growth habit is determined mainly by the VRN-A1 locus.

AB Germination potential, i.e. vigour manifested at sensu stricto germination, was studied in 22 rice varieties to distinguish between the genetic control for low vigour (lv) at fresh harvest and lv after ageing of seeds. For identifying seed vigour-associated DNA marker(s), correlative studies between (1) physiological parameters viz. germination of (a) unaged seeds under optimum and cold stressed condition, (b) aged seeds under optimal condition and (2) growth-associated biochemical parameters viz. alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and esterase (EST) activity during early germination of fresh seeds and antioxidant potential in dry embryos of fresh and aged (1 year) seeds were undertaken. ADH and EST activity as well as antioxidant potential showed positive correlation with speed of embryo emergence and early seedling growth of seeds. The reduction of antioxidant potential in aged seeds also appeared proportional to germination performance. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis between the varieties was correlated with the above-mentioned vigour parameters, using multiple regression analysis. This led to the identification of four bands associated with the vigour trait at 99% significance level; of these, the similar to 900-bp DNA fragment (named as HVAC 19), through basic local alignment search tool nucleotides analysis, revealed a sequence homology with acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) gene of wheat at 94% similarity level.

AB Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the causal organism of the necrotrophic foliar wheat disease tan spot [also known as yellow (leaf) spot in Australia] is an important disease in Australia and in many parts of the world. North American isolates of the pathogen have been shown to produce combinations of three host-specific toxins, ToxA, ToxB and ToxC. Each toxin interacts with a host sensitivity locus, respectively Tsn1, Tsc2 and Tsc1. The virulence of an isolate is partially correlated with the presence of these toxins and resistance in the host is associated with absence of the sensitivity loci. Breeding for resistance to tan spot can, therefore, be aided by knowledge of the prevalence of the toxin-encoding genes in local pathogen populations. Two of the toxins, A and B, are encoded by known genes and molecular tests for the genes have been developed. We screened a diverse collection of 119 tan spot isolates collected between 1984 and 2008 and from all affected regions of Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia). In all cases, the gene for ToxA was present and the gene for ToxB was absent. The implications for resistance breeding and epidemiology of the disease are discussed. We also de. ne a diagnostic molecular marker for P. tritici-repentis.

AB Brassicaceae is an important family of the plant kingdom which includes several plants of major economic importance. The Brassica spp. and Arabidopsis share much-conserved colinearity between their genomes which can be exploited for the genomic research in Brassicaceae crops. In this study, 131,286 ESTs of five Brassicaceae species were assembled into unigene contigs and compared with Arabidopsis gene indices. Almost all the unigenes of Brassicaceae species showed high similarities with Arabidopsis genes except those of B. napus, where 90% of unigenes were found similar. A total of 9,699 SSRs were identified in the unigenes. PCR primers were designed based on this information and amplified across species for validation. Functional annotation of unigenes showed that the majority of the genes are present in metabolism and energy functional classes. It is expected that comparative genome analysis between Arabidopsis and related crop species will expedite research in the more complex Brassica genomes. This would be helpful for genomics as well as evolutionary studies, and DNA markers developed can be used for mapping, tagging, and cloning of important genes in Brassicaceae.

AB Wheat end-use product quality is highly influenced by the composition and quantity of high-and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS and LMW-GS). In the present study, 224 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines were characterised for the HMW-GS and LMW-GS with allele-specific PCR markers and sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results showed that 56 cultivars (25.0%) carried the allele Glu-D1-1d (Dx5), while 80 cultivars (35.7%) with the allele Glu-B1-2a (By8) produced a 527-bp specific band. Fourteen genotypes (6.3%) with the allele Glu-B1e (Bx20) yielded a 701-bp amplicon with the marker Mar and a 753-bp specific PCR fragment with the marker ZSBy9aF1/R3. Glu-B1h (Bx14+By15) was present in only 1 genotype, and 2 cultivars contained the allele Glu-B1f (Bx13+By16) identified with the marker ZSBy9F2/R2. Four genotypes (1.8%) with the allele Glu-B1-1d (Bx6) gave 695-bp and 830-bp bands, and 5 genotypes (2.2%) with the allele Glu-B1i (Bx17+By18) amplified a 659-bp fragment using the marker Bx. One hundred and six cultivars (47.3%) had the allele Glu-B1-2b (By9), amplifying a 663-bp fragment with the marker ZSBy9aF1/R3; 34 genotypes (15.8%) contained the allele Glu-B3d, generating a 662-bp PCR fragment with the marker gluB3d. Fifteen cultivars (7.0%) with the allele Glu-B3b yielded 1570-bp and 750-bp PCR amplicons with the markers gluB3b and gluB3bef, respectively. The allele Glu-B3h was found in 7 cultivars, generating a 1022-bp PCR fragment with the marker gluB3h. The genotypes detected by SDS-PAGE were mostly consistent with those identified by molecular markers, confirming the utility of the molecular markers. The information for the HMW-GS and LMW-GS in Chinese wheat cultivars will be useful in wheat breeding programs.

AB Late maturity alpha-amylase (LMA) in wheat is a defect where high-isoelectric point (pI) alpha-amylase accumulates in the ripening grain. Wheat genotypes vary in expression from zero to high levels of alpha-amylase, the latter with detrimental consequences on their use for value-added end products. Expression in each genotype is characterised by varying numbers of grains affected and different levels in each grain. Analysis of a doubled haploid (DH) population (188 lines) from WW1842 x Whistler has identified significant QTL on chromosomes 2DL, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4B, 4D, 5DS and 5BL. The 4B LMA allele (P < 0.0001) from Whistler is closely linked to the QTL for the 'tall' allele (P < 0.0001) of the Rht-B1 gene. The 4D LMA QTL (P < 0.0001) in WW1842 co-locates with the QTL for the 'tall' allele (P < 0.0001) of the Rht-D1 gene. This study has shown for the first time that a DH cross between two semi-dwarf cultivars with low or no LMA produces similar to 25% of progeny lines of the 'tall' genotypes with a high frequency of LMA. This is attributed to the large additive positive effects from the combination of one recessive 'tall' Rht-B1 gene and one recessive 'tall' Rht-D1 gene. High-yielding semi-dwarf genotypes with different combinations of Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 alleles which have very low or nonexistent LMA expression (e. g. WW1842 and Whistler) may meet industry criteria for registration as commercial wheat varieties. However, when they are used as breeding lines, the cross produces some progeny genotypes with severe levels of LMA. These LMA genotypes comprise the gibberellic acid-sensitive 'tall' progenies and a very small proportion of semi-dwarfs. Thus, it is of paramount importance to screen the defect in wheat breeding programs. The suite of QTL identified for LMA will enable the use of marker assisted selection in the pyramiding of the beneficial QTL to maximise yield and minimise (or eliminate) LMA in semi-dwarf genotypes.

AB Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops of the world. In order to achieve continued genetic gain in wheat improvement programs, an assessment and utilisation of genetic diversity in a wide range of germplasm are required. The Australian Winter Cereal Collection (AWCC, Tamworth) holds over 33 000 accessions of wheat. In this study, we scanned the genome of 1057 accessions of hexaploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) originating from different geographic regions of the world, with 178 polymorphic DArT (TM) markers. These accessions comprised modern cultivars (MCs), advanced breeding lines (BLs), and landrace cultivars (LCs). Our results indicate that the LCs had higher polymorphic information content (PIC values) than the MCs and BLs. Cluster and principal coordinate analysis based on genetic distance matrices enabled classification of the 1057 accessions into 12 subgroups. The structure of subgroups appeared to be geographically determined and was generally consistent with pedigrees. Molecular analyses revealed that LCs have unique alleles compared with MCs and BLs, which may be useful for the genetic improvement of wheat.

AB Photoperiod and vernalization genes are important for the optimal adaptation of wheat to different environments. Diagnostic markers are now available for Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1 and Ppd-D1, with all four genes variable in southern Australian wheat-breeding programs. To estimate the effects of these genes on days to heading we used data from 128 field experiments spanning 24 years.
   From an analysis of 1085 homozygous cultivars and breeding lines, allelic variation for these four genes accounted for similar to 45% of the genotypic variance for days to heading. In the presence of the photoperiod-insensitive allele of Ppd-D1, differences between the winter genotype and genotypes with a spring allele at one of the genes ranged from 3.5 days for Vrn-B1 to 4.9 days for Vrn-D1. Smaller differences occurred between genotypes with a spring allele at one of the Vrn genes and those with spring alleles at two of the three genes. The shortest time to heading occurred for genotypes with spring alleles at both Vrn-A1 and Vrn-D1. Differences between the photoperiod-sensitive and insensitive alleles of Ppd-D1 depended on the genotype of the vernalization genes, being greatest when three spring alleles were present (11.8 days) and least when the only spring allele was at Vrn-B1 (3.7 days). Because of these epistatic interactions, for the practical purposes of using these genes for cross prediction and marker-assisted selection we concluded that using combinations of alleles of genes simultaneously would be preferable to summing effects of individual genes.
   The spring alleles of the vernalization genes responded differently to the accumulation of vernalizing temperatures, with the common spring allele of Vrn-A1 showing the least response, and the spring allele of Vrn-D1 showing a response that was similar to, but less than, a winter genotype.

AB Degenerate primers designed from the conserved regions of nucleotide-binding site domains of known plant resistance gene products were used to scan a complete set of wheat-Lophopyrum elongatum addition lines. Forty-six clones were isolated and they were grouped into seven families of resistance gene analogues (RGA). All families were characterised as the Toll-Interleukin receptor group of R-genes (plant disease resistance genes). The putative chromosome-specific SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) loci were identified by multiple sequence alignments. Furthermore, 20 E chromosome-specific RGA markers were used to identify polymorphic fragments in wheat-Lo. elongatum addition lines and amphidiploid. The results suggested that these chromosome-specific markers could be not only useful for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning of R-genes in Lo. elongatum, but also feasible for investigating the evaluation process of the E genome.

AB Diuraphis noxia (Russian wheat aphid, RWA), one of the most aggressive pests of wheat, has evolved several biotypes with virulence matching known Dn resistance genes. This paper was aimed at determining the location of plant-defence genes triggered by RWA in a set of doubled haploid (DH) lines obtained from the cross of winter wheat varieties 'Spark' and 'Rialto'. Both parental lines, 110 DH and CItr2401 (a RWA-resistant line) were screened for antixenosis, tolerance and antibiotic mechanisms of resistance with a population of RWA collected in Argentina. Antixenosis was not significantly linked to any marker locus. Tolerance traits showed significant associations with several chromosomes. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the foliar area developed during infestation was significantly associated with marker loci Xpsp3103 on 4DS, and Xgdm3 on 5DS. QTL for chlorophyll content in the infested plants were significantly associated with the marker loci Xgwm533 on 3BS and Xpsp3094 on 7AL, and a QTL for the number of expanded leaves was associated with the marker loci Xwmc264 on 3AS and XwPt8836 on 4DS. QTL for most of the tolerance traits were significantly associated with the same chromosome intervals on chromosomes 4DS and 5DS. The 4DS QTL were linked to or had a pleiotropic effect on Rht-D1. Most of the antibiosis traits were significantly associated with the same marker loci on chromosomes 4A (XwPt7405), 1B (XwPt9032) and 5B (Xbarc109 and Xbarc74). Several novel genes conferring tolerance and antibiosis to RWA were identified and these could be transferred into wheat cultivars to enlarge the genetic base of defence against this aphid pest. These new genes can be designated as QDn.unlp genes, following the rules for gene nomenclature in wheat.

AB Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) have significant effects on the processing quality of enduse products of common wheat. It is more efficient to discriminate LMW-GSalleles with PCR-based molecular markers than with SDS-PAGE. In the present study, we developed an allele-specific PCR marker, designated Glu-B3abefg, which can be used to discriminate protein alleles Glu-B3a, b,e,f, and g simultaneously. Based on ten previously developed allele-specific STS markers, three multiplex PCRs, viz. Glu-B3c + Glu-B3d, Glu-B3b + Glu-B3g, and Glu-B3h + Glu-B3i, were established. Six Glu-B3 alleles (b, c, d, g, h, and i) could be discriminated using the three multiplex PCRs. Results of tests on 158 wheat varieties and lines using Glu-B3abefg and the three multiplex PCRs were consistent with those using the ten STS markers separately. The new allele-specific marker and three multiplex PCRs represent an efficient way to undertake marker-assisted selection of Glu-B3 alleles.

AB The growing demands for food, feed, and bio-energy worldwide will require a 2% per annum increase in global maize (Zea mays L.) production. Maize is one of the most important staple food crops across the developing world as well as being an important feed crop for global livestock production and the emerging biofuel industry. Maize genotypes can range from 0.5 to 5 m standing height at flowering, mature in 60 to 330 d from planting, produce 1 to 4 ears per plant, 10 to 1800 kernels per ear and yield from 0.5 to 23.5 Mg of grain per hectare. Even greater genetic diversity is present in related species yet surprisingly little of the maize-related biodiversity is present in the current elite breeding pools. Improved methods and tools for germplasm conservation, characterization, and data sharing, as well as for population improvement, gene pool enhancement, and genomics-aided breeding are urgently needed if increases in maize productivity, particularly in the developing world, are to keep pace with predicted increases in demand. Progress in the private sector, particularly with the development of temperate maize cultivars, is far beyond that of the public sector, particularly regarding tropical maize cultivar development. This article provides an overview of progress at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) with national partner across the developing world. Particular emphasis is given to issues related to the continued development of elite maize breeding material as global public goods, especially regarding the introgression of new variations from genetic resources and the legal and phytosanitary issues related to international exchange of maize germplasm.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with long coleoptiles can be sown deeply for better seedling establishment in drought environments. A population of 139 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between a long-coleoptile Chinese landrace, Wangshuibai, and short-coleoptile U.S. wheat cultivar, Wheaton, were characterized for coleoptile length and plant height. Heritabilities for coleoptile length were high (h(2) > 0.82). Interval mapping identified six significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) on 1B, 3D, 4DS, 4DL, 5AS, and 513 for coleoptile length; four of them, on 3D, 4DS, 4DL, and 5AS, showed pleiotropic effects on plant height. One major QTL for long coleoptile was mapped on the locus Rht-D1 (Rht2) for reduced height (Rht) on chromosome 4DS and explained up to 65% of phenotypic variation for coleoptile length. Another major QTL was located on 4DL and explained up to 33% of phenotypic variation for coleoptile length. Standard height allele RhtD1a from Wangshuibai appeared to have an epistatic effect on the 4DL QTL for long coleoptile. Other QTL showed only a minor effect. Although Rht-D1a explained a major portion of genetic variation for long coleoptile in Wangshuibai, a combination of Rht-D1a in Wangshuibai with gibberellic acid (GA)-sensitive Rht genes for reduced wheat height from other sources should be able to select long coleoptiles, semi-dwarf cultivars in wheat breeding programs for which long coleoptile is a breeding objective.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., is an important foliar disease of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Leaf rust resistance gene Lr42 from Aegilops tauschii Coss has been used as a source of rust resistance in breeding programs. To identify molecular markers closely linked to Lr42, a segregating population, of near-isogenic lines contrasting for the presence of Lr42 was developed in the hard winter wheat cultivar Century background and evaluated for rust infection type at both seedling and adult-plant stages. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened using bulked-segregant analysis. Two markers closely linked to Lr42 were identified on chromosome 1DS. The closest marker, Xwmc432, is about 0.8 cM from Lr42. Physical mapping of both SSR markers using Chinese Spring nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic genetic stocks confirmed that the markers lined to Lr42 were on 1DS. Markers for Lr42 were highly polymorphic between parents and among a diverse set of wheat parents and among a diverse set of wheat germplasm collected from several countries, indicating that these markers are useful for marker-assisted selection for Lr42.

AB The large bread wheat genome (1C similar to 17 Gbp) contains a preponderance of repetitive DNA and the species is polyploid. These characteristics together serve to hamper the molecular analysis of the wheat genome. Its complexity can, however, be reduced by using flow cytometry to isolate individual chromosomes, and these can be exploited to construct chromosome-specific BAC libraries. Such libraries simplify the task of physical map construction, positional cloning and the targeted development of genetic markers. Rapid improvements in the efficiency and cost of DNA sequencing provide an opportunity to contemplate sequencing the wheat genome by preparing sequence-ready physical maps for each chromosome or chromosome arm in turn. The quality of the chromosome-specific libraries depends on their chromosome coverage and the mean insert size. First-generation libraries suffered from a relatively low mean insert size, but improvements to the protocol have generated a second wave of libraries with a significantly increased mean insert size and better chromosome coverage. Each chromosome (arm)-specific library is composed of a manageable number of clones, and so represents a practical tool in the area of wheat genomics. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB The short arm of rye chromosome 1R (1RS) is introduced into many common wheat cultivars because of its agronomic importance. The gametocidal system has been used to produce dissection lines carrying segments of rye chromosome 1R. We focused on establishing more dissection lines for 1RS and on obtaining PCR-based markers specific to 1RS. We established 66 1RS dissection lines carrying 1RS segments of chromosome 1R derived from a common wheat cultivar 'Burgas 2' and obtained 27 markers. We conducted a PCR analysis using the dissection lines and markers, and divided 1RS into 17 regions separated by the breakpoints. Comparison of the 'Burgas 2' 1RS map with another map of 1RS derived from 'Imperial' rye implied a restructuring between the 2 1RS chromosomes. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

ID STATISTICAL-METHODS; MAP; GENES
AB Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping is based on radiation-induced chromosome breakage rather than meiotic recombination, as a means to induce marker segregation for mapping. To date, the implementation of this mapping approach in hexaploid (Triticum aestivum L.; 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD) and tetraploid (T. turgidum L.; 2n = 4x = 28; AABB) wheat has concentrated on the production of mapping panels for individual chromosomes. In order to extend the usefulness of this approach, we have devised a method to produce panels for the simultaneous mapping of all chromosomes of the D sub-genome of hexaploid wheat. In this approach, seeds of hexaploid wheat (AABBDD) are irradiated and the surviving plants are crossed to tetraploid wheat (AABB) to produce a mapping panel based on quasi-pentaploids (AABBD). Chromosome lesions in the A and B genomes are largely masked in the quasi-pentaploids due to the presence of A-and B-genome chromosomes from the tetraploid parent. On the other hand, the chromosomes from the D-genome are present in one copy (hemizygous) and allow radiation hybrid mapping of all D-genome chromosomes simultaneously. Our analyses showed that transmission of D-genome chromosomes was apparently normal and that radiation-induced chromosome breakage along D-genome chromosomes was homogeneous. Chromosome breakage levels between D-genome chromosomes were comparable except for chromosome 6D which suffered greater chromosome breakage. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing D-genome radiation hybrids (DGRHs) in wheat. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Multiplex PCR was developed and optimized for simultaneous detection of wheat leaf rust resistance genes Lr26 and Lr37. The presence of the genes was analyzed in 21 winter wheat cultivars registered in the Czech Republic. Gene Lr37 was detected in four tested cultivars (Bakfis, Biscay, Nicol, Mulan), gene Lr26 occurred only in one cultivar (Etela) and three cultivars (Clarus, Orlando and Rapsodia) were found to carry both these genes. Data obtained by PCR markers were compared with results of greenhouse and field tests. Seedling reactions of cultivars possessing Lr26 to seven different leaf rust isolates conformed to the results obtained by the marker analysis, however, there were found some discrepancies in the detections of Lr37, which could be detected in greenhouse seedling tests only with difficulties.

AB T he sequences of the closely linked barley dehydrin genes Dhn4 and Dhn7 are both known to vary allelically. Here we associated allelic constitution at Dhn4/7 with frost sensitivity across a panel of 30 diverse barley varieties. The combined presence of a 6 bp insertion in exon1 of Dhn4 and a 30 bp deletion in exon1 of Dhn7 was restricted to six-rowed winter and intermediate varieties characterised by relatively higher frost tolerance (12 genotypes; LT(50) from -14.2 degrees C to -15.6 degrees C). The alternative combination was present with one exception (six-rowed winter variety Alissa) only in spring and two-rowed winter varieties (17 genotypes; LT(50) from -10.0 degrees C to -14.3 degrees C). The genetic linkage between Dhn4 and Dhn7 identified e. g. in Dictoo and Morex varieties was verified by segregation analysis of F(2) plants from a cross between two genotypes carrying different allelic combination of Dhn4 and Dhn7 genes (two-rowed spring variety Akcent x six-rowed winter variety Okal). The potential of the former allelic combination as a marker for enhanced frost tolerance was tested in a sample of F(5) derivatives of a cross between the two-rowed winter type variety Monaco (Akcent allele combination) and the six-rowed winter type variety Okal. Plants with the Okal allele combination showed significantly higher frost tolerance than those with the alternative growth habit. The effect of ear type on frost tolerance was insignificant.

AB The Lr56/Yr38 translocation consists primarily of alien-derived chromatin with only the 6AL telomeric region being of wheat origin. To improve its utility in wheat breeding, an attempt was made to exchange excess Ae. sharonensis chromatin for wheat chromatin through homoeologous crossover in the absence of Ph1. Translocation heterozygotes that lacked Ph1 were test-crossed with Chinese Spring nullisomic 6A tetrasomic 6B and nullisomic 6A-tetrasomic 6D plants and the resistant (hemizygous 6A) progeny were analyzed with four microsatellite markers. Genetic mapping suggested general homoeology between wheat chromosome 6A and the translocation chromosomes, and showed that Lr56 was located near the long arm telomere. Thirty of the 53 recombinants had breakpoints between Lr56 and the most distal marker Xgwm427. These were characterized with additional markers. The data suggested that recombinants #39, 157 and 175 were wheat chromosomes 6A with small intercalary inserts of foreign chromatin containing Lr56 and Yr38, located distally on the long arms. These three recombinants are being incorporated into adapted germplasm. Attempts to identify the single shortest translocation and to develop appropriate markers are being continued.

AB Rust resistance genes (introgressions S24 and S13) transferred to hexaploid wheat from two Aegilops speltoides accessions could not be used commercially due to associated gametocidal (Gc) genes. Crosses to wheat followed by rigorous selection for increased fertility were employed in an attempt to separate the unmapped S24 stem rust resistance from the Gc gene(s). However, improved fertility of the better selections could not be maintained in subsequent generations. Since the S13 introgression (leaf, stripe and stem rust resistances) mapped to chromosome 3A, allosyndetic pairing induction was used in an attempt to remove the Gc gene(s). This produced putative primary recombinants with improved fertility and plant type, the best of which had exchanged a small region of Ae. speltoides chromatin, yet was still associated with (reduced) Gc effects. This selection (04M127-3, which appears to have the Su1-Ph1 suppressor) was then crossed with wheat. Surprisingly, the 04M127-3 gametocidal effect differed drastically from that of the original introgression allowing the recovery of 35 recombinant, leaf rust resistant progeny. Microsatellite and DArT markers showed that each secondary recombinant had exchanged most of the Ae. speltoides chromatin. Although the data suggested that a complex multigenic interaction may govern the gametocidal response, preliminary indications are that the Gc effect had largely been removed and it now seems possible to completely separate the gametocidal genes from the S13 leaf rust resistance gene (here designated Lr66). The associated (S13) stripe rust and stem rust resistance genes were lost during recombination.

AB A recent introduction of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) pathotype 134 E16A+ in Western Australia differed from existing pathotypes in its virulence for stripe rust resistance genes Yr8 and Yr9, and avirulence for Yr3, Yr4, Yr34 and some uncharacterized sources of resistance. The Australian wheat cultivar Rubric exhibited a very low seedling stripe rust response when tested against the Pst pathotype 134 E16A+. Genetic analysis of a Rubric/Avocet 'S' F(3) population indicated monogenic inheritance of resistance. The resistance gene was tentatively designated YrRub. Bulked segregant analysis using multiplex-ready PCR technology placed YrRub distal to the microsatellite marker barc75 in chromosome 3BS. Follow up studies mapped SSR marker cfb3530 between YrRub (2.9 +/- A 1.3 cM) and barc75 (2.4 +/- A 1.2 cM). Genotypes Bolac, EMU 'S', Nesser, Hybrid 46 (Yr4) and Avalon (Yr4) amplified the YrRub-linked barc75 and cfb3530 alleles. The amplification of PCR products similar to that of Rubric in Yr4-carrying cultivars Hybrid 46 and Avalon suggested that YrRub was most likely to be Yr4. Due to unavailability of genotypes carrying Yr4 singly, test of allelism was not possible. Thirty-eight Australian wheat cultivars known to lack YrRub, an advanced breeding line WAWHT2046 (Yr34) and Vilmorin 23 (Yr3) amplified PCR products different from that of Rubric at the barc75 and cfb3530 marker loci. The amplification of non-Rubric alleles at the marker barc75 and cfb3530 loci among a set of diverse wheat genotypes demonstrated that these markers could be used for marker assisted selection of YrRub in combination with other molecularly tagged seedling and adult plant stripe rust resistance genes in wheat breeding programs.

AB Two wheat varieties, one highly resistant (HD29) and another susceptible (WH542) and their recombinant lines were taken for expression profiling of cystatins at three stages (WS1, WS2 and WS3) of the developing spikes. Different biochemical and immunological techniques like protease inhibitor assay, ELISA, DOT-BLOT immunoassay and SDS-PAGE analysis were employed to reveal the relationship of cystatin expression with stage dependent resistance (P0.01). Interestingly, in all the genotypes cystatin expression was the highest at WS2 stage which is most susceptible to Karnal bunt (KB) pathogen. Expression was higher in the resistant recombinant inbred lines than in the susceptible ones (P0.0001). Percent disease severity results were also in accordance with cystatin expression studies and thus suggesting a direct role of cystatins in providing resistance against KB. Based on the presence of potential component markers like cystatins which are involved in defence, identification of resistant wheat germplasms can prove to be an important strategy for successful KB management.

AB Expressed sequence tag (EST) markers have been used to assess variety and genetic diversity in wheat (Triticum aestivum). In this study, 1549 ESTs from wheat infested with yellow rust were used to examine the genetic diversity of six susceptible and resistant wheat cultivars. The aim of using these cultivars was to improve the competitiveness of public wheat breeding programs through the intensive use of modern, particularly marker-assisted, selection technologies. The F 2 individuals derived from cultivar crosses were screened for resistance to yellow rust at the seedling stage in greenhouses and adult stage in the field to identify DNA markers genetically linked to resistance. Five hundred and sixty ESTs were assembled into 136 contigs and 989 singletons. BlastX search results showed that 39 (29%) contigs and 96 (10%) singletons were homologous to wheat genes. The database-matched contigs and singletons were assigned to eight functional groups related to protein synthesis, photosynthesis, metabolism and energy, stress proteins, transporter proteins, protein breakdown and recycling, cell growth and division and reactive oxygen scavengers. PCR analyses with primers based on the contigs and singletons showed that the most polymorphic functional categories were photosynthesis (contigs) and metabolism and energy (singletons). EST analysis revealed considerable genetic variability among the Turkish wheat cultivars resistant and susceptible to yellow rust disease and allowed calculation of the mean genetic distance between cultivars, with the greatest similarity (0.725) being between Harmankaya99 and SOnmez2001, and the lowest (0.622) between Aytin98 and Izgi01.

AB Pigeonpea is the second most important pulse crop of India accounting for almost 90% of the World's pigeonpea area and production. Altering the plant types could improve the economic yield and its adaptability as well. Molecular markers can identify and tag plant type genes without much environmental interference. In the present investigation of identifying and tagging RAPD markers linked with the plant type trait, the plant material consisted of parents, F(1) and a F(2) population obtained by crossing genotypes TT44-4 with open-tall and TD12004-1 with compact-dwarf plant types. RAPD analysis was performed on 84 genotyped F(2) plants following a bulked segregant analysis (BSA) approach. In the parental screening with 200 random decamer primers, only eight showed polymorphism, of which only two could be linked to the plant type gene. Two markers (OPF04(700) and OPA09(1375)) were identified that were present in the open-tall plants, while absent in compact-dwarf plants. Linkage analysis showed that the markers OPF04(700) and OPA09(1375) were located 8.4 +/- 0.03 cM and 9.6 +/- 0.032 cM, respectively away from the plant type gene locus. The markers were validated in 15 genotypes with open-tall plant type. The utilization of the marker and the dwarfing gene is discussed.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive disease in wheat. The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on 3BS from Sumai 3 and its derivatives has been used as a major Source of the resistance to FHB worldwide, but the discrepancy in reported location of the major QTL could block its using in map based cloning and marker assisted selection. In this study, Chinese Spring-Sumai 3 chromosome 3B substitution line was used as resistant parent of the mapping population to reduce the confounded effect of genetic background in Sumai 3. The major QTL region was saturated with the Sequence Tagged Microsatellite (STM) and Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers. A linkage map of chromosome 313 with 36 markers covering a genetic distance of 112.4 cM was constructed. Twelve new markers were inserted into the chromosome region where the major QTL was located. The average interval distance between markers was 1.5 cM. Multiple QTL Models (MQM) mapping indicated that the major QTL was located in the interval of Xgwm533-Xsts9-1, and explained 45.6% of phenotypic variation of the resistance to FHB. The SSR (simple sequence repeat) marker Xgwm533 and STM marker Xstm748tcac are closely linked to the major QTL.

AB The genetic stability of wheat/rye ('Chinese Spring'/'Imperial') disomic addition lines was checked using the Feulgen method and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Feulgen staining detected varying proportions of disomic, monosomic, and telosomic plants among the progenies of the disomic addition lines. The greatest stability was observed for the 7R addition line, while the most unstable lines were those with 2R and 4R additions. Chromosome rearrangements were also detected using FISH. Based on the specific hybridization patterns of repetitive DNA probes pSc119.2 and (AAC)(5), as well as ribosomal DNA probes (5S and 45S), isochromosomes were identified in the progenies of 1R and 4R addition lines. The results draw attention to the importance of continuous cytological checks on basic genetic materials by using FISH, because this method reveals chromosome rearrangements that could not be detected either with the conventional Feulgen staining technique or with molecular markers.

AB The winter wheat cultivar Red Chief has been identified as the wheat cultivar most resistant to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr). This study was undertaken to determine the inheritance, chromosomal location and molecular mapping oft tan spot resistance gene in Red Chief. chi(2) analysis of the F(2) segregation data of the hybrids between 21 monosomic lines of the susceptible wheat cultivar Chinese Spring and the resistant cultivar Red Chief revealed that tan spot resistance in cv. Red Chief is controlled by a single recessive gene located on chromosome 3A. Linkage analysis using SSR markers in the Red Chief/Chinese Spring F(2) population showed that the tsr4 gene is clustered in the region aroundXgwm2a, on the short arm of chromosome 3A. This marker has also been identified as the closest marker to the tsr3 locus on chromosome 3D in synthetic wheat lines. Validation analysis of this marker for the tsr3 and tsr4 genes using 28 resistant and 6 susceptible genotypes indicated that the 120 bp allele (the tsr3 gene) specific fragment was observed in 11 resistant genotypes, including the three synthetic lines XX41, XX45 and XX110, while the 130 bp allele was amplified only in CV. Red Chief and Dashen. Xgwm2a can be used to trace the presence of the target gene in successive backcross generations and pyramiding of the tsr3 & tsr4 genes into a commonly grown and adaptable cultivar.

AB The OS9XQ36 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) mapping population (Reg. No. MP-2, NSL 465170) is a set of 164 F-6-derived recombinant inbred lines (USDA-ARS Germplasm Resources Information Network [GRIN] accession no. GSTR 11903 through GSTR 12066) from the cross between OS9A (PI 658243), a single plant selection from the cultivar Stephens (CI 17596), and QCB36 (PI 658244), a single plant selection from the elite breeding line OR9900553. This population was developed to investigate the consistently lower grain hardness and superior end-use quality of OR9900553 compared with Stephens. This population has also been genotyped with diversity array technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers resulting in the construction of a 270-marker linkage map covering 1785 cM at a density of one marker per 7 cM. This F-6-derived population is one of 20 mapping populations being used by the WheatCAP consortium (http://maswheat.ucdavis.edu/) for extensive quantitative trait locus analysis and forms part of a publicly available long-term genetic resource to map complex traits in wheat.

AB Using degenerate primers based on the conserved nucleotide binding site (NBS) and protein kinase domain (PKD), 100 resistance gene analogs (RGAs) were isolated from tobacco variety Nicotiana repanda. BLASTx search against the GenBank database revealed that 27 belong to the NBS class and 73 belong to the protein kinase (PK) class. Cluster analysis and multiple sequence alignment of the deduced protein sequences indicate that RGAs of the NBS class can be divided into two groups: toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) and non-TIR types. Both types possess 6 conserved motifs (P-loop, RNBS-A, Kinase-2, RNBS-B, RNBS-C, GLPL). Based on their sequence similarity, the tobacco RGAs of the PK class were assigned to 8 subclasses. We examined their expression after infection with either Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or the tobacco black shank pathogen (Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae). The expression levels of 4 RGAs of the PK class were significantly elevated by TMV and 1 RGA of the PK class and 3 RGAs of the NBS class were up-regulated by P. parasitica var. nicotianae. The expression of two RGAs of the PK class was induced by P. parasitica var. nicotianae. Infection by either TMV or P. parasitica var. nicotianae enhanced the expression of NtRGA2, a RGA of the PK class. The present study shows that RGAs are abundant in the tobacco genome and the identification of tobacco RGAs induced by pathogens should provide valuable information for cloning related resistance genes in tobacco.

AB Zinc deficiency is a critical nutritional problem in soils, restricting yield and nutritional quality of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Some genotypes (Zn-efficient) can produce greater yield and accumulate more Zn in seed under Zn deficiency than standard (Zn-inefficient) genotypes. However, there is little information regarding the genetics of Zn uptake/accumulation and location of genes conferring Zn efficiency in barley. Selection through molecular markers for seed Zn accumulation might be an efficient complementary breeding tool in barley. With the aim of developing molecular markers for increased accumulation of Zn in seed, a population of 150 DH lines derived from a cross between Clipper (low-Zn-accumulator) and Sahara 3771 (high-Zn-accumulator) was screened in the field and glasshouse for seed Zn concentration and content. One dominant DNA polymorphism was detected using the microsatellite-anchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) technique. The candidate MFLP marker was isolated from the MFLP gel, re-amplified by PCR, cloned, sequenced, and converted into simple sequence-specific and PCR-based marker. This marker, located on the short arm of chromosome 2H, might be useful for the improvement of barley nutritional quality and productivity programs in Zn-deficient environments. However, high seed Zn alone can not replace the need for Zn fertilization.

AB P>The study of genetic diversity between a crop and its wild relatives may yield fundamental insights into evolutionary history and the process of domestication.
   In this study, we genotyped a sample of 303 accessions of domesticated soybean (Glycine max) and its wild progenitor Glycine soja with 99 microsatellite markers and 554 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.
   The simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci averaged 21.5 alleles per locus and overall Nei's gene diversity of 0.77. The SNPs had substantially lower genetic diversity (0.35) than SSRs. A SSR analyses indicated that G. soja exhibited higher diversity than G. max, but SNPs provided a slightly different snapshot of diversity between the two taxa. For both marker types, the primary division of genetic diversity was between the wild and domesticated accessions. Within taxa, G. max consisted of four geographic regions in China. G. soja formed six subgroups. Genealogical analyses indicated that cultivated soybean tended to form a monophyletic clade with respect to G. soja.
   G. soja and G. max represent distinct germplasm pools. Limited evidence of admixture was discovered between these two species. Overall, our analyses are consistent with the origin of G. max from regions along the Yellow River of China.

AB P>To understand key mechanisms leading to stabilized allopolyploid species, we characterized the meiotic behaviour of wheat allohexaploids in relation to structural and genetic changes.
   For that purpose, we analysed first generations of synthetic allohexaploids obtained through interspecific hybridization, followed by spontaneous chromosome doubling, between several genotypes of Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii wheat species, donors of AB and D genomes, respectively.
   As expected for these Ph1 (Pairing homoeologous 1) gene-carrying allopolyploids, chromosome pairing at metaphase I of meiosis essentially occurs between homologous chromosomes. However, the different synthetic allohexaploids exhibited progenitor-dependent meiotic irregularities, such as incomplete homologous pairing, resulting in univalent formation and leading to aneuploidy in the subsequent generation.
   Stability of the synthetic allohexaploids was shown to depend on the considered genotypes of both AB and D genome progenitors, where few combinations compare to the natural wheat allohexaploid in terms of regularity of meiosis and euploidy. Aneuploidy represents the only structural change observed in these synthetic allohexaploids, as no apparent DNA sequence elimination or rearrangement was observed when analysing euploid plants with molecular markers, developed from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as well as simple sequence repeat (SSR) and transposable element sequences.

AB Waxflower is one of Australia's major native cut flowers for the export market. A number of interspecific hybrid cultivars such as the 'Pearl' series bred by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia have increased the competitiveness of waxflower on world markets. To improve the breeding efficiency, resistance gene analog polymorphisms (RGAP) are investigated as molecular markers for the early identification of interspecific hybrids between Chamelaucium uncinatum and C. megalopetalum. The results show that RGAP can be effectively applied to generate DNA markers to identify true waxflower hybrids. The RGAP marker system provides a reliable, simple, fast and inexpensive approach for hybrid identification in waxflower breeding.

AB Upland rice (UR) is a unique rice ecotype that can be grown on upland fields without surface water accumulation in cultivation. Although UR has long been recognised as an important genetic resource for breeding of drought-tolerant rice varieties, it is facing the risk of genetic erosion due to the rapid spread of high-yielding modern rice strains. In this study, genetic diversity and relationships among 221 UR accessions collected from southwest China were evaluated using microsatellite (i.e. simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers. A total of 269 alleles were detected using 28 pairs of SSR primers, and the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 20, with an average of 9.6. The polymorphism information content value, a measure of gene diversity, was 0.63 with a range of 0.25-0.89. Clustering analysis showed that all 236 accessions fell into two groups corresponding to indica and japonica. More than 75% of UR accessions were identified as japonica. We detected no clear relationship between genetic similarity and geographical distances, which may be partially due to the frequent seed exchange by local farmers. Our study revealed relatively high levels of genetic diversity in the Chinese UR germplasm, which could provide invaluable genetic resources for improving economically important traits in rice, such as tolerance to drought stress.

AB Sixty two doubled haploid (DH) lines from the cross between cultivars Izvor (high osmotic adjustment) and Jiana (medium osmotic adjustment), obtained using the "Zea system", were used to study the association between the capacity for osmotic adjustment, as estimated by the pollen grain test developed by Morgan (1999), and several SSR markers located on chromosome 7A. SSR m arkers Xwmc9, Xwmc596 and Xwmc603 were significantly associated with pollen grain response to immersion in solution of 55% PEG + KCI, being located at approximately 9.1 cM estimated distance from the osmotic adjustment gene. These markers, which had a relatively low recombination frequency with the osmotic adjustment locus, can prove useful for increasing the frequency of progenies with better performance under drought in a wheat breeding program.

AB Accumulated evidence has shown that each of the three basic Brassica genomes (A, B and C) has undergone profound changes in different species, and has led to the concept of the "subgenome". Significant intersubgenomic heterosis was observed in hybrids between traditional Brassica napus and first generation lines of new type B. napus. The latter were produced by the partial introgression of subgenomic components from different species into B. napus. To increase the proportion of exotic subgenomic components and thus achieve stronger heterosis, lines of first generation new type B. napus were intercrossed with each other, and subjected to intensive marker-assisted selection to develop the second generation of new type B. napus. The second generation showed better agronomic traits and a higher proportion of introgression of subgenomic components than did the first generation. Compared with the commercial hybrid and the hybrids produced with the first generation new type B. napus, the novel hybrids showed stronger heterosis for seed yield during the 2 years of field trials. The extent of heterosis showed a significant positive correlation with the introgressed subgenomic components in the parental new type B. napus. To increase the content of the exotic subgenomic components further and to allow sustainable breeding of novel lines of new type B. napus, we initiated the development of a gene pool for new type B. napus that contained a substantial amount of genetic variation in the A(r) and C(c) genome. We discuss new approaches to broaden the avenue of intersubgenomic heterosis in oilseed Brassica.

AB The aim of the present study was to detect candidate DNA markers for leaf rust resistance gene Lr13. The NIL groups were constructed from a set of near isogenic lines of wheat cv. Thatcher containing in total 41 different Lr resistance genes. A total number of 246 primer combinations in the NIL groups were screened for DNA polymorphism by using the AFLP method. Twenty-eight AFLP primer combinations yielded 33 polymorphic bands in Tc+Lr13 line. To confirm these polymorphic bands, 28 primer combinations were investigated in 41 Thatcher near isogenic lines. Six primer combinations amplified specific band products in Tc+Lr13. It was concluded that these AFLP markers can be linked to Lr13 gene and in further studies on Lr13 resistance gene, these six AFLP markers should be analyzed in near isogenic lines. Also, construction of the NIL groups can be useful in terms of time and cost of the molecular researches including Thatcher near isogenic lines.

AB Low temperature is one of the most important abiotic stresses limiting wheat growth and productivity. Selection for complex genetic traits, such as freezing resistance, can simplify the plant breeding programs when related markers are identified and present in the breeding lines. In the present study, ten improved bread wheat lines were assessed for freezing resistance based on LT50 measurement. Randomized complete block design with three replications were used. Four types of seed proteins: high molecular weight glutenin, low molecular weight glutenin, gliadin and some water-salt soluble proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAG..Our results showed significant differences between studied lines in respect with LT50. Some relationships were also seen between protein subunits and freezing resistance. In addition, significant increase in prolific accumulation in leaf tissue of LT-tolerant cultivars was seen during cold acclimation. This may be used as a biochemical marker to identify resistant cultivars.

TI Development and implementation of high-throughput SNP genotyping in

DT Article

   SSR; DNA; POPULATION; WHEAT; RICE
AB Background: High density genetic maps of plants have, nearly without exception, made use of marker datasets containing missing or questionable genotype calls derived from a variety of genic and non-genic or anonymous markers, and been presented as a single linear order of genetic loci for each linkage group. The consequences of missing or erroneous data include falsely separated markers, expansion of cM distances and incorrect marker order. These imperfections are amplified in consensus maps and problematic when fine resolution is critical including comparative genome analyses and map-based cloning. Here we provide a new paradigm, a high-density consensus genetic map of barley based only on complete and error-free datasets and genic markers, represented accurately by graphs and approximately by a best-fit linear order, and supported by a readily available SNP genotyping resource.
   Results: Approximately 22,000 SNPs were identified from barley ESTs and sequenced amplicons; 4,596 of them were tested for performance in three pilot phase Illumina GoldenGate assays. Data from three barley doubled haploid mapping populations supported the production of an initial consensus map. Over 200 germplasm selections, principally European and US breeding material, were used to estimate minor allele frequency (MAF) for each SNP. We selected 3,072 of these tested SNPs based on technical performance, map location, MAF and biological interest to fill two 1536-SNP "production" assays (BOPA1 and BOPA2), which were made available to the barley genetics community. Data were added using BOPA1 from a fourth mapping population to yield a consensus map containing 2,943 SNP loci in 975 marker bins covering a genetic distance of 1099 cM.
   Conclusion: The unprecedented density of genic markers and marker bins enabled a high resolution comparison of the genomes of barley and rice. Low recombination in pericentric regions is evident from bins containing many more than the average number of markers, meaning that a large number of genes are recombinationally locked into the genetic centromeric regions of several barley chromosomes. Examination of US breeding germplasm illustrated the usefulness of BOPA1 and BOPA2 in that they provide excellent marker density and sensitivity for detection of minor alleles in this genetically narrow material.

TI Simultaneous mutation detection of three homoeologous genes in wheat by
   High Resolution Melting analysis and Mutation Surveyor (R)
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM MARKERS; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; AMPLICONS
AB Background: TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a powerful tool for reverse genetics, combining traditional chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput PCR-based mutation detection to discover induced mutations that alter protein function. The most popular mutation detection method for TILLING is a mismatch cleavage assay using the endonuclease CelI. For this method, locus-specific PCR is essential. Most wheat genes are present as three similar sequences with high homology in exons and low homology in introns. Locus-specific primers can usually be designed in introns. However, it is sometimes difficult to design locus-specific PCR primers in a conserved region with high homology among the three homoeologous genes, or in a gene lacking introns, or if information on introns is not available. Here we describe a mutation detection method which combines High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis of mixed PCR amplicons containing three homoeologous gene fragments and sequence analysis using Mutation Surveyor (R) software, aimed at simultaneous detection of mutations in three homoeologous genes.
   Results: We demonstrate that High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis can be used in mutation scans in mixed PCR amplicons containing three homoeologous gene fragments. Combining HRM scanning with sequence analysis using Mutation Surveyor (R) is sensitive enough to detect a single nucleotide mutation in the heterozygous state in a mixed PCR amplicon containing three homoeoloci. The method was tested and validated in an EMS (ethylmethane sulfonate)-treated wheat TILLING population, screening mutations in the carboxyl terminal domain of the Starch Synthase II (SSII) gene. Selected identified mutations of interest can be further analysed by cloning to confirm the mutation and determine the genomic origin of the mutation.
   Conclusion: Polyploidy is common in plants. Conserved regions of a gene often represent functional domains and have high sequence similarity between homoeologous loci. The method described here is a useful alternative to locus-specific based methods for screening mutations in conserved functional domains of homoeologous genes. This method can also be used for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) marker development and eco-TILLING in polyploid species.

AB Oryza sativa L. F(2) population and F(2:3) derived from a cross between salt tolerance cv. Tarommahali and salt sensitive cv. Khazar were used in this study. A linkage map based on F(2) population was constructed (74 SSR markers on 192 individuals), which covered a total of 1231.50 cM with an average two locus interval of 19.83 cM. Two QTLs related to Na(+)/K(+) ratio were found on chromosome 3 and 6. qDM-3 and qDM-8 (for dry mass of shoot) are major QTLs with very large effects explained 20.90 and 17.72 % of the total phenotypic variance, respectively. Major locus for DM (qDM-3) was bracketed by RM1022 - RM6283 spread over 13.6 cM on chromosome 3. Major part of the variability for standard tolerance ranking (STR) was explained by the qSTR-6 flanked by RM3727 - RM340 on chromosome 6, which exhibited phenotypic variance of 17.25 % and peak likelihood ratio (LR) of 17.51. The length of this QTL is 8.8 cM and identification of any tightly linked markers in this region will serve as a candidate gene for fine-mapping. qSTR-3 overlapped with qNA-3 and qNAK-3. The qSTR-3 may contain a new major gene for salt stress tolerance at seedling stage in rice. Major QTLs identified in this paper, after fine-mapping, could be used for marker assisted selection.

AB The teosinte Zea nicaraguensis forms constitutive aerenchyma in the root cortex as observed in flooding tolerant wetland plants. We have previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling aerenchyma formation under non-flooding conditions on chromosome I (Qaer1.06) using 214 individuals of a maize Mi29 x Z nicaraguensis BC2F1 population. The present studies objective was to increase the marker density around the Qaer1.06 locus, which is essential for the development of near-isogenic lines possessing the aerenchyma-forming gene with only a small region of the Z nicaraguensis chromosome segment. A survey of 62 SSR and 38 insertion/deletion (INDEL) markers identified a total of 36 useful markers in the region of interest. These were selected for the construction of a linkage map in a 214 individual BC2F1 and a 123 individual BC4F1 population from a cross between Mi29 x Z nicaraguensis. Using the BC4F1 population, we performed QTL mapping and the results indicated that a QTL for aerenchyma formation under non-flooding condition was located on chromosome I (bin 1.05) at a position that is near to Qaer1.06. The markers obtained here should be useful for the development of high quality near-isogenic lines possessing the Qaer1.05-6.

AB Barley is one of the major cereals in the world. The analysis of genomes is important in modem breeding, but the barley genome is too huge and complicated that it is still difficult to arrange sequenced pieces of the genome in order. Each of the barley chromosomes or chromosome arms has been added to common wheat and such barley chromosome addition lines have been used in determining the chromosomal regions of genes and DNA markers. It is undoubtedly desirable to have the genome divided into smaller pieces in separate common wheat lines. There is a unique genetic system in common wheat that induces frequent chromosomal structural rearrangements. This system is called the gametocidal (Gc) system involving alien chromosomes called Gc chromosomes, which were introduced into common wheat from certain wild species belonging to the genus Aegilops. When the Gc chromosome exists in a common wheat plant in monosomic condition, the plant produces two types of gamete, one with the Gc chromosome and the other without the Gc chromosome; chromosomal rearrangements occur only in the latter one. Such Gc-induced chromosomal rearrangements are either lethal to gametes or semi-lethal, and in the latter case the gametes are fertilized to develop into viable zygotes carrying rearranged chromosomes. The Gc system proved to be effective in inducing structural rearrangements in barley chromosomes added to common wheat, as well as in common wheat chromosomes. Thus-induced rearranged chromosomes include deletions of barley chromosomes and translocations between the barley and wheat chromosomes. The present author termed common wheat lines carrying rearranged barley chromosomes 'dissection lines' of a barley chromosome. So far dissection lines for three barley chromosomes have been produced and used in the cytological mapping of the barley chromosomes. In this article the progress in the cytological dissection of the barley genome is described.

AB The Triticeae crops comprise wheat, barley, rye and triticale, which together provide a major portion of the world's food and feed. The growing demand for human nutrition and renewable energy requires an intensification in application-oriented research and the establishment and utilization of current biotechnology in these crops. Genetic transformation provides an important means both to elucidate gene function, and to engineer crop plants in a directed and precise way. This review covers a range Of issues surrounding the production of stable transgenic lines within the Triticeae. Some quality aspects of transgenesis of particular relevance to the Triticeae are also discussed.

AB Flowers which show cleistogamy (CL) remain closed during pollen shedding, and thus are predominantly self-pollinated. CL in barley is controlled either by the single, multi-allelic gene cly1 located on the long arm of chromosome 2H, or by two closely linked, epistatic genes (cly1 and Cly2). Here, we have taken advantage of the co-linearity which exists between chromosome 2H of barley and rice chromosome 4 to generate de novo markers targeted to the CL region, and these have been used to construct a localized high resolution genetic map. While synteny is largely conserved in this region, the critical 18 cM barley segment appears to be inverted with respect to the equivalent 1.6 Mb physical stretch of the rice genome. The cly1 locus was located in a 0.76 cM region of barley genetic map, and rice orthologue of cly1 (if there is one) is one of the 11 genes predicted to lie within 90 kb interval of rice genome.

AB The crossability of common wheat with alien species, e.g., rye, wild and cultivated barley, is known to be controlled by the Kr gene family. The reproduction barrier caused by Kr genes decreases hybrid seed set; however, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. We attempted to localize the QTLs controlling the crossability of wheat in wheat-rye crosses by using molecular markers on wheat chromosome 5B on which the most effective Kr gene is known to be located. QTL mapping was carried out using the F-7 population derived from a cross between Chinese Spring (high crossability) and a chromosome substitution line of Chinese Spring which has its chromosome 5B of Cheyenne (low crossability), and pollinated with rye cv. Petkus. In this population, a major QTL region controlling crossability with rye was detected on the locus closely linked to a SSR marker, Xgwm443, on the short arm of chromosome 5B which was supposed to be Skr locus.

AB Barley is more sensitive than the other major cereal crops to aluminium (Al) toxicity. Here, a doubled haploid mapping population was exploited to study the inheritance of Al tolerance in barley. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was based on a genetic map constructed with genic markers. Al tolerance QTL were identified on chromosomes 2H, 3H and 4H. A sequence homology search was used to derive the putative function of the genes linked to the QTL, in order to identify potential candidate genes for Al tolerance. Some of these candidates are implicated in stress/defence responses, in particular, stress signal transduction, transcription regulation factors and cell metabolism.

AB Rye chromosome 1R harbors many agronomically important genes such as resistance genes for rusts. Using the gametocidal system, we dissected the 1R chromosome substituted for wheat chromosome 1B in a common wheat cultivar 'Burgas 2'. The gametocidal system induces chromosomal breakage in the 1R chromosome, as well as in wheat chromosomes. We cytologically examined a pool of prescreened common wheat plants that had been shown to have single or multiple rearranged 1R chromosomes and established 95 common wheat lines carrying single 1R segments. We conducted PCR analysis of these lines, termed '1R dissection lines', using 10 PCR-based 1R-specific markers. We mapped the 10 PCR-based markers along the 1R chromosome with the breakpoints of the 1R dissection lines. Based on the PCR result and the positions of the primary and secondary constrictions, we could separate the breakpoints of the rearranged 1R chromosomes into 12 regions along the 1R chromosome. On the other hand, using the breakpoints, we could separate the PCR-based markers from each other except for two markers. These dissection lines are useful in mapping DNA markers and may facilitate the construction of costing maps.

AB Microsatellites are highly mutable, repetitive sequences commonly used as genetic markers, but they have never been studied en masse. Using a custom microarray to measure hybridization intensities of every possible repetitive nucleotide motif from 1-mers to 6-mers, we examined 25 genomes. Here, we show that global microsatellite content varies predictably by species, as measured by array hybridization signal intensities, correlating with established taxonomic relationships, and particular motifs are characteristic of one species versus another. For instance, hominid-specific microsatellite motifs were identified despite alignment of the human reference, Celera, and Venter genomic sequences indicating substantial variation (30-50%) among individuals. Differential microsatellite motifs were mainly associated with genes involved in developmental processes, whereas those found in intergenic regions exhibited no discernible pattern. This is the first description of a method for evaluating microsatellite content to classify individual genomes.

AB Alternative oxidase (Aox) has been proposed as a functional marker for breeding stress tolerant plant varieties. This requires presence of polymorphic Aox allele sequences in plants that affect plant phenotype in a recognizable way. In this review, we examine the hypothesis that organization of genomic Aox sequences and gene expression patterns are highly variable in relation to the possibility that such a variation may allow development of Aox functional markers in plants. Aox is encoded by a small multigene family, typically with four to five members in higher plants. The predominant structure of genomic Aox sequences is that of four exons interrupted by three introns at well conserved positions. Evolutionary intron loss and gain has resulted in the variation of intron numbers in some Aox members that may harbor two to four introns and three to five exons in their sequence. Accumulating evidence suggests that Aox gene structure is polymorphic enough to allow development of Aox markers in many plant species. However, the functional significance of Aox structural variation has not been examined exhaustively. Aox expression patterns display variability and typically Aox genes fall into two discrete subfamilies, Aox1 and Aox2, the former being present in all plants and the latter restricted in eudicot species. Typically, although not exclusively, the Aox1-type genes are induced by many different kinds of stress, whereas Aox2-type genes are expressed in a constitutive or developmentally regulated way. Specific Aox alleles are among the first and most intensively stress-induced genes in several experimental systems involving oxidative stress. Differential response of Aox genes to stress may provide a flexible plan of plant defense where an energy-dissipating system in mitochondria is involved. Evidence to link structural variation and differential allele expression patterns is scarce. Much research is still required to understand the significance of polymorphisms within AOX gene sequences for gene regulation and its potential for breeding on important agronomic traits. Association studies and mapping approaches will be helpful to advance future perspectives for application more efficiently.

AB Wheat head blight caused by Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusarium graminearum) is a threat to food safety in China because of mycotoxin contamination of the harvested grain, the frequent occurrence of the disease, and the failure of chemical control in some areas due to benzimidazole resistance in the pathogen population. The molecular resistance mechanism, however, of G. zeae to benzimidazole fungicides (especially carbendazim; active ingredient: methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate [MBC]) is poorly understood. DNA sequences of a beta-tubulin gene (beta(2)tub) (GenBank access number FG06611.1) in G. zeae were analyzed. Mutations in beta(2)tub in moderately resistant strains (MBC(MR)) included TTT (Phe) -> TAT (Tyr) at codon 167 or TTC (Phe) -> TAC (Tyr) at codon 200. A highly resistant strain (MBC(HR)) had two point mutations, one at codon 73, CAG (Gln) -> CGG (Arg), and the other at codon 198, GAG (Glu) -> CTG (Leu). To confirm that mutations in the beta(2)tub confer resistance to benzimidazole fungicides, the entire beta(2)Tub locus was deleted from MBC(MR) and MBC(HR) strains of G. zeae. The resulting. Delta beta(2)tub mutants from both MBCMR and MBCHR strains grew normally on MBC-free potato dextrose agar medium and were supersensitive to MBC. Complementation of the. beta(2)tub mutants by transformation with a copy of the intact beta(2)Tub locus from their parent strains exhibited less resistance than the original strains, and complementation of the. beta(2)tub mutants by transformation with a copy of the intact beta(2)Tub locus from sensitive strains restored MBC sensitivity. The results indicated that the mutations in the beta(2)tub gene conferred resistance of G. zeae to benzimidazole fungicides and this gene can be used as a genetic marker in G. zeae.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the Vrn-1 allelic composition of spring wheat germplasm from the Pacific Northwest region of the USA. Individual plants from 56 spring wheat lines were crossed to near-isogenic tester lines carrying the dominant allele Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1 or Vrn-D1. F(2) progeny were evaluated for growth habit in the field and Vrn-1 allelic composition was determined through chi-square analysis. Lines also were analysed with DNA sequence-based Vrn-1 allele-specific markers. A majority of the germplasm carried the dominant allele Vrn-A1a alone or in combination with Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1 or Vrn-B3 alleles. Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 were almost always associated with other dominant Vrn-1 allele(s). Based on DNA sequence analysis, a novel Vrn-B1 allele referred to as Vrn-B1b, which carried a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a 36 bp deletion, was identified in cultivar 'Alpowa'. These results will be useful to wheat breeders for choosing parents with different Vrn-1 alleles for crossing to maximize diversity at the Vrn-1 loci with an expectation of identifying superior Vrn-1 allelic combinations for cultivar improvement.

AB A mutant tomato cultivar (HT10-3-2) with indeterminate growth habit was obtained from a cultivar (T10-3-2) with determinate growth habit. The character of indeterminate growth habit in HT10-3-2 could be inherited stably. Unlike other normal growth habit cultivars, which are controlled by the SELF PRUNING gene, it was shown here that HT10-3-2 has no mutation in the sp gene. Two hundred random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers were used to screen for polymorphism between the two genotypes from genomic DNA, and a polymorphic fragment (S168(1458)) was obtained and subsequently sequenced. However, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool searches indicated that the sequence of this RAPD fragment shares no significant homology with known sequences in GenBank. The RAPD marker (S168(1458)) was converted to a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, SCA168(1453). The SCAR marker was tested using an F(2) population derived from the cross of T10-3-2 and HT10-3-2 and the results showed that this marker was closely linked with the unknown factor influencing the growth habit in HT10-3-2.

AB A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the winter wheat cultivars Arina and Forno was used to study the genetic relationship between genes Yr1 and SrAn1 in chromosome 2AL. Yr1 from Forno showed repulsion linkage (16 center dot 5 cM) with SrAn1 carried by Arina and was proximal to SrAn1. Based on the chromosomal location of SrAn1 with respect to Yr1 and its ineffectiveness against the Australian Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici pathotype 34-1,2,7 + Sr38, it was concluded that SrAn1 is distinct from Sr21 and was designated as Sr48. An attempt was made to map more markers in the distal region of chromosome 2AL in order to determine the precise location of Sr48. Unfortunately none of the markers tested mapped between Yr1 and Sr48, with the latter being the most distal locus. However, close linkage was identified between Yr1 and the PCR-based molecular marker stm673acag. Genotyping with stm673acag amplified a 120-bp fragment in eight of nine genotypes carrying Yr1. Avocet S was the only line tested without Yr1 that also amplified the 120-bp product. A 124-bp product was amplified in 40 Australian wheat cultivars known to lack Yr1. These results suggest that stm673acag could be used for marker assisted selection of Yr1. Genotypes carrying both Yr1 and Sr48 were identified.

AB Storage protein activator (SPA) is a key regulator of the transcription of wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain storage protein genes and belongs to the Opaque2 transcription factor subfamily. We analyzed the sequence polymorphism of the three homoeologous Spa genes in hexaploid wheat. The level of polymorphism in these genes was high particularly in the promoter. The deduced protein sequences of each homoeolog and haplotype show greater than 93% identity. Two major haplotypes were studied for each Spa gene. The three Spa homoeologs have similar patterns of expression during grain development, with a peak in expression around 300 degree days after anthesis. On average, Spa-B is 10 and seven times more strongly expressed than Spa-A and Spa-D, respectively. The haplotypes are associated with significant quantitative differences in Spa expression, especially for Spa-A and Spa-D. Significant differences were found in the quantity of total grain nitrogen allocated to the gliadin protein fractions for the Spa-A haplotypes, whereas the synthesis of glutenins is not modified. Genetic association analysis between Spa and dough viscoelasticity revealed that Spa polymorphisms are associated with dough tenacity, extensibility, and strength. Except for Spa-A, these associations can be explained by differences in grain hardness. No association was found between Spa markers and the average single grain dry mass or grain protein concentration. These results demonstrate that in planta Spa is involved in the regulation of grain storage protein synthesis. The associations between Spa and dough viscoelasticity and grain hardness strongly suggest that Spa has complex pleiotropic functions during grain development.

AB Transgene copy number is an important criterion for determining the utility of transgenic events. Single copy integration events are highly desirable when the objective is to produce marker free plants through segregation or when it is necessary to introgress different transgenes into commercial cultivars from different transgenic events. In contrast multi-copy events are advocated by several authors for higher expression of the transgene. Till recently, it was thought that employment of the particle gun for transformation results in the production of a high proportion of multi-copy events often with complex integration pattern when compared to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. However, it has been demonstrated that usage of cassette DNA for bombardment in place of whole plasmids would result in simple insertion pattern of the transgenes. While investigating the effect of varying the cassette DNA amount on stable transformation, the frequency of occurrence of low copy events was observed to increase when lower doses of cassette DNA was employed for bombardment. Large scale experimentation with rigorous statistical analysis performed to verify the above observations employing Helium gun and the Electric discharge gun for gene delivery confirmed the above observations. Helium gun experiments involving production of more than 1,600 corn events consistently yielded single copy events at higher frequencies at lower cassette DNA load (46% at 2.5 ng/shot) as compared to higher cassette DNA load (29% at 25 ng/shot) across 18 independent experiments. Results were nearly identical with the Electric discharge particle gun device where single copy events were recovered at frequencies of 54% at 2.5 ng cassettes DNA per shot as compared to 18% at 25 ng cassette DNA per shot. The transformation frequency declined from 41 to 34% (Helium gun) and from 48 to 31% (Electric discharge gun) with reduction in cassette DNA quantity from 25 to 2.5 ng per shot. This reduction in the transformation frequency is more than compensated by the savings in time and effort involved in the production and screening of events if the desired outcome is single copy events. These results demonstrate the flexibility of the particle gun method for controlling the frequency of production of either low copy or high copy events by altering the quantity of cassette DNA used for bombardment. The transgene expression levels over generations in relation to its integration need further investigations.

AB Two PCR based markers tightly linked to Cre1 and Cre3 resistant genes against the Cereal Cyst Nematode (CCN, causal agent Heterodera avenae) were used to characterize a number of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat germplasm consisting of obsolete, advanced lines and new cultivars from the Turkish National Breeding Program and the joint TURKEY CIMMYT ICARDA International Winter Wheat Improvement Program. In addition a number of landraces and wild relatives of wheat collected from the Turkish side of the Fertile Crescent, the centre of origin of cereals, were included. None of the genetic material tested positive for either marker except the land race Sardari which originated from neighboring Iran was found positive for Cre1 gene. Combining both of these molecular markers in one assay for fast and cost-effective screening of the germplasm was not effective, so marker genotyping with germplasm was realized using each primer alone. Most work that has been reported is on the CCN species H. avenae, however the predominant species in Turkey is the closely related H. filipjevi. In vitro resistance assaying for this species indicates that Cre1 is a moderate source of resistance against the H. filipjevi population, however Cre3 gene appears ineffective. It is suggested that a larger pool of a range of germplasm should be screened for Cre1 in Turkey. Furthermore, the landrace Sardari could be used as a parent to deploy CCN resistance in to genetic background of Turkish bread wheat cultivars with a targeted Marker Assisted Selection Backcrossing approach.

AB Russian wheat aphid (RWA; Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov) infestations of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) have reduced yield and quality in the United States since 1986. Resistant germplasm lines, including STARS-9577B, have been used for cultivar development. Our objective was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for RWA resistance in STARS-9577B and compare them to previously mapped loci. A set of 185 F(2:3) families from 'Morex'/STARS-9577B was tested in replicated trials in the greenhouse based on a 1 to 9 visual rating of chlorosis. Morex is a susceptible six-rowed malting barley. Polymerase chain reaction-based markers polymorphic between STARS-9577B and Morex were used to create a 146 marker linkage map: Quantitative trait loci analysis located two loci for resistance, one on the short arm of chromosome 1H and the other on the long arm of 3H. The 1H locus was associated with a B-hordein marker showed additive gene action and explained 19% of the variation. The 3H locus was associated with marker EBmac0541, showed partial domiance and explained 47% of the variation . Combined, the two loci explain 55% of the phenotypic variation for RWA reaction . Results showed that STARS 9577B lacks a resistance allele at one of the QTL found is STARS-9301B, which may explain the consistently higher RWA score (lower resistance) of 3 in STARS-9577B versus the lower score (higher resistance) of 2 in STARS 9301B, indicating that the QTL on chromosome 2H is an important factor in determining resistance.

AB Little is currently known about the genetic variation within diverse gene pools of cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Knowledge in this area could aid in future germplasm maintenance activities, provide additional information in the area of N. tabacum population genetics, and assist in selection of materials for breeding or genetic investigations. To this end, 702 N. tabacum accessions from the U.S. Nicotiana Germplasm Collection were genotyped with 70 microsatellite markers. A total of 1031 alleles were detected, with an average of 14.7 alleles per marker. Average gene diversity was quite large (0.7362) and was three times the value for a diverse population of U.S. flue-cured tobacco. Cluster analysis using various distance coefficients generated seven consistent groups. Patterns of geographic-specific clustering were frequent but not universal. An analysis of molecular variance for tobacco collected from Central and South America revealed that 92% of the total genetic variation among samples could be attributed to country-specific subpopulations. There was also a significant level of population subdivision between country-specific subpopulations, however. Tobacco samples collected from Peru had both the largest average gene diversity and the largest mean genetic distance, although N. tabacum collected from Mexico had the greatest allelic richness. Tobacco samples collected from Argentina were the most divergent subpopulation.

AB Genetic diversity and genetic integrity were tested for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landraces conserved in two gene banks with considerably different germplasm management systems. We identified two sets of 17 wheat accessions derived from identical sources collected in Pakistan, which were later deposited at the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Japan (NIAS) and the Plant Genetic Resources Program, Pakistan (PGRP). Regeneration of the conserved germplasm was infrequent at both gene banks. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) profiles did not indicate prominent changes in the banding patterns of the wheat landraces conserved at the two gene banks. No significant differences were observed in allele frequency of the detected loci in comparison to the original collections (materials preserved without regeneration and multiplication), except in one accession at NIAS. We conclude that genetic diversity was conserved at these two gene banks with different management systems. However, among the 161 scored loci, 26 AFLP bands disappeared at the same loci in NIAS and PGRP accessions, four disappeared only in NIAS accessions, and 28 only in PGRP accessions. At one particular locus, the band disappeared in 12 PGRP accessions but not in NIAS accessions. The results indicate that unique selection might occur at PGRP and that regeneration strategies to reduce it will be needed in the future.

AB The resistance genes Lr9, Lr24, Lr25, Lr29, Lr35 and Lr37, which were not previously utilised in Hungary, have been incorporated into four Martonvasar winter wheat cultivars using marker-assisted selection with PCR-based markers. In the course of a backcross programme, the genes were transferred into Martonvasar wheat varieties and various BC generations were produced. Work aimed at pyramiding resistance genes is currently underway in Martonvasar, and plants containing the gene combinations Lr9 + Lr24, Lr9 + Lr25 and Lr9 + Lr29 are now available. From the BC2F4 generation of the 'Mv Emma'*3/'R. L. 6010' combination ('R.L. 6010' is the donor of the Lr9 gene) 287 lines were tested for leaf rust resistance in an artificially inoculated nursery. A co-dominant primer combination was designed to identify both resistant and susceptible offsprings. The results of resistance tests and molecular marker detection agreed in most cases. Designated leaf rust resistance genes were identified with molecular markers in wheat varieties and breeding lines. The Lr26 and Lr34 resistance genes occur frequently in the Martonvasar gene pool, and the presence of the Lr37 gene has also been detected in a number of Hungarian genotypes.

AB Recent updates in comparative genomics among cereals have provided the opportunity to identify conserved orthologous set (COS) DNA sequences for cross-genome map-based cloning of candidate genes underpinning quantitative traits. New tools are described that are applicable to any cereal genome of interest, namely, alignment criterion for orthologous couples identification, as well as the Intron Spanning Marker software to automatically select intron-spanning primer pairs. In order to test the software, it was applied to the bread wheat genome, and 695 COS markers were assigned to 1,535 wheat loci (on average one marker/2.6 cM) based on 827 robust rice-wheat orthologs. Furthermore, 31 of the 695 COS markers were selected to fine map a pentosan viscosity quantitative trait loci (QTL) on wheat chromosome 7A. Among the 31 COS markers, 14 (45%) were polymorphic between the parental lines and 12 were mapped within the QTL confidence interval with one marker every 0.6 cM defining candidate genes among the rice orthologous region.

AB Use of molecular markers has emerged as a powerful and efficient approach to complement traditional plant breeding for improving crops. An array of molecular markers are now available that include RFLP that is based on Southern blot hybridization and, RAPD, ISSR, SSR and STS are based on polymerase chain reaction. The AFLP and CAPS markers are the other PCR based markers involving pre and post amplification restriction digestion, respectively. The most recent marker system is single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that utilizes the vast DNA sequence resources available in different crop species. Each of these markers has its own strengths and limitations. Markers are being used in several different aspects of crop improvement including estimation of genetic diversity, construction of high density genome maps, mapping and tagging of genes, map-based isolation of genes and marker assisted selection (MAS). MAS is carried out for transferring target gene(s) from one genetic background to another using tightly linked markers (foreground selection). MAS is also carried out to quickly recover recurrent parent genome in backcross breeding using a large number of either random or mapped markers having whole genome,coverage (background selection). Hence, MAS requires markers tightly linked to the genes for the target traits as well as high-density genome maps in crops of interest. This condition is not fulfilled in all crops and traits. The Division of Genetics, IARI has taken a lead in this approach in breeding for rust resistance in wheat, blight and blast resistance in rice. MAS has been effectively employed in pyramiding identified genes involving short breeding cycles through background and foreground selection thereby adding resistance to established cultivars of each crop.

AB The "green revolution" involving mainly wheat and rice was based on the use by breeders of semidominant mutations involved in the signal transduction pathway of Gibberellin (GA). In particular, mutations in the Reduced height (Rht) gene of wheat have been used to reduce plant height and consequently to avoid storm damage and lodging. These genes have been cloned and they encode for DELLA proteins which contain an N-terminal DELLA and a VHYNP domain essential for GA-dependent degradation of these proteins. In maize several mutations have been isolated which affect gibberellin biosynthesis and perception and in particular, mutations in Dwarf8 (D8) gene cause a severe dwarfing phenotype. D8 gene has been identified as an orthologue of Rht (Reduced height), Slr1(Slender rice 1) and Gibberellic Acid Insensitive (GAI) genes, this latter is a negative regulator of GA response in Arabidopsis. In this work, for the first time, we isolated and characterized a single amino acid insertion in the VHYNP domain of D8 maize gene causing the appearance of a dominant dwarf mutation. This spontaneous mutation, named D8-1023, showed a phenotype which is less severe in comparison with the other D8 mutants previously isolated which have modifications in the DELLA domain. This mutant appears to be an useful tool either to study the mechanism of GA-modulated growth in plants or to lower the height of maize tropical germplasm for breeding purposes.

AB Pollen fertility restoration of the CMS phenotype caused by H. chilense cytoplasm in wheat was associated with the addition of chromosome 6H(ch)S from H. chilense accession H1. In order to develop an euploid restored line, different genomic combinations substituting the 6H(ch)S arm for another homoeologous chromosome in wheat were evaluated, with the conclusion that the optimal combination was the translocation T6H(ch)S center dot 6DL. The double translocation T6H(ch)S center dot 6DL in H. chilense cytoplasm was obtained. This line is fertile and stable under different environmental conditions. However, a single dose of the T6H(ch)S center dot 6DL translocation is insufficient for fertility restoration when chromosome 6D is also present. Restoration in the msH1 system is promoted by interaction between two or more genes, and in addition to the restorer of fertility (Rf) located on chromosome 6H(ch)S, one or more inhibitor of fertility (Fi) genes may be present in chromosome 6DL.

TRPM8-immunoreactivity was detected in a small proportion of the WGA-HRP-labeled bladder afferent neurons in the dorsal root ganglia of the Th13-L1 (1.14%) and the L6-S1 (1.27%). and these neurons were small in size (< 600 mu m(2)). The 82.6 +/- 3.8% of the TRPM8-immunoreactive bladder afferent neurons and 80.9 +/- 1.5% of the total population of the TRPM8-immunoreactive afferent neurons in the observed dorsal root ganglia expressed NF200 On the other hand, the proportions of the co-expression of TRPM8 and nociceptive markers such as calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP), transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). and isolectin B4(IB4) in the bladder afferent neurons (81.5 +/- 5.2% for CGRP, 36.1 +/- 4.0% for TRPV1. and 15.8 +/- 5.5% for IB4) were higher in comparison to those in the total population of the TRPM8-immunoreactive afferent neurons (21.9 +/- 2.4% for CGRP, 16.6 +/- 1.7% for TRPV1, and 5.4 +/- 0.5% for IB4). although no significant difference existed for IB4 Our results suggest that the TRPM8-expressing bladder afferents should be classified as A delta-fibers and C-fibers. while some of these afferents; may be involved in nociceptive sensations (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society All rights reserved.

AB Lophopyrum elongatum (tall wheatgrass), a wild relative of wheat, can be used as a source of novel genes for improving salt tolerance of bread wheat. Sodium 'exclusion' is a major physiological mechanism for salt tolerance in a wheat-tall wheatgrass amphiploid, and a large proportion (similar to 50%) for reduced Na+ accumulation in the flag leaf, as compared to wheat, was earlier shown to be contributed by genetic effects from substitution of chromosome 3E from tall wheatgrass for wheat chromosomes 3A and 3D. Homoeologous recombination between 3E and wheat chromosomes 3A and 3D was induced using the ph1b mutant, and putative recombinants were identified as having SSR markers specific for tall wheatgrass loci. As many as 14 recombinants with smaller segments of tall wheatgrass chromatin were identified and low-resolution breakpoint analysis was achieved using wheat SSR loci. Seven recombinants were identified to have leaf Na+ concentrations similar to those in 3E(3A) or 3E(3D) substitution lines, when grown in 200 mM NaCl in nutrient solution. Phenotypic analysis identified recombinants with introgressions at the distal end on the long arm of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes being responsible for Na+ 'exclusion'. A total of 55 wheat SSR markers mapped to the long arm of homoeologous group 3 markers by genetic and deletion bin mapping were used for high resolution of wheat-tall wheatgrass chromosomal breakpoints in selected recombinants. Molecular marker analysis and genomic in situ hybridisation confirmed the 524-568 recombinant line as containing the smallest introgression of tall wheatgrass chromatin on the distal end of the long arm of wheat chromosome 3A and identified this line as suitable for developing wheat germplasm with Na+ 'exclusion'.

AB Italian common wheat cultivars Libellula and Strampelli, grown for over three decades in Gansu province of China, have shown effective resistance to stripe rust. To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, F(3) populations were developed from crosses between the two cultivars and susceptible Chinese wheat cultivar Huixianhong. The F(3) lines were evaluated for disease severity in Beijing, Gansu and Sichuan from 2005 to 2008. Joint- and single-environment analyses by composite interval mapping identified five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in Libellula for reduced stripe rust severity, designated QYr.caas-2DS, QYr.caas-4BL, QYr.caas-5BL.1, QYr.caas-5BL.2 and QYr.caas-7DS, and explained 8.1-12.4, 3.6-5.1, 3.4-8.6, 2.6 and 14.6-35.0%, respectively, of the phenotypic variance across four environments. Six interactions between different pairs of QTLs explained 3.2-7.1% of the phenotypic variance. The QTLs QYr.caas-4BL, QYr.caas-5BL.1 and QYr.caas-7DS were also detected in Strampelli, explaining 4.5, 2.9-5.5 and 17.1-39.1% of phenotypic variance, respectively, across five environments. Three interactions between different pairs of QTLs accounted for 6.1-35.0% of the phenotypic variance. The QTL QYr.caas-7DS flanked by markers csLV34 and Xgwm295 showed the largest effect for resistance to stripe rust. Sequence analyses confirmed that the lines with the QYr.caas-7DS allele for resistance carried the resistance allele of the Yr18/Lr34 gene. Our results indicated that the adult-plant resistance gene Yr18 and several minor genes confer effective durable resistance to stripe rust in Libellula and Strampelli.

AB The use of major resistance genes is a cost-effective strategy for preventing stem rust epidemics in wheat crops. The stem rust resistance gene Sr39 provides resistance to all currently known pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) including Ug99 (TTKSK) and was introgressed together with leaf rust resistance gene Lr35 conferring adult plant resistance to P. triticina (Pt), into wheat from Aegilops speltoides. It has not been used extensively in wheat breeding because of the presumed but as yet undocumented negative agronomic effects associated with Ae. speltoides chromatin. This investigation reports the production of a set of recombinants with shortened Ae. speltoides segments through induction of homoeologous recombination between the wheat and the Ae. speltoides chromosome. Simple PCR-based DNA markers were developed for resistant and susceptible genotypes (Sr39#22r and Sr39#50s) and validated across a set of recombinant lines and wheat cultivars. These markers will facilitate the pyramiding of ameliorated sources of Sr39 with other stem rust resistance genes that are effective against the Pgt pathotype TTKSK and its variants.

TI MlAG12: a Triticum timopheevii-derived powdery mildew resistance gene in

AB Wheat powdery mildew is an economically important disease in cool and humid environments. Powdery mildew causes yield losses as high as 48% through a reduction in tiller survival, kernels per head, and kernel size. Race-specific host resistance is the most consistent, environmentally friendly and, economical method of control. The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm line NC06BGTAG12 possesses genetic resistance to powdery mildew introgressed from the AAGG tetraploid genome Triticum timopheevii subsp. armeniacum. Phenotypic evaluation of F(3) families derived from the cross NC06BGTAG12/'Jagger' and phenotypic evaluation of an F(2) population from the cross NC06BGTAG12/'Saluda' indicated that resistance to the 'Yuma' isolate of powdery mildew was controlled by a single dominant gene in NC06BGTAG12. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) revealed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers specific for chromosome 7AL segregating with the resistance gene. The SSR markers Xwmc273 and Xwmc346 mapped 8.3 cM distal and 6.6 cM proximal, respectively, in NC06BGTAG12/Jagger. The multiallelic Pm1 locus maps to this region of chromosome 7AL. No susceptible phenotypes were observed in an evaluation of 967 F(2) individuals in the cross NC06BGTAG12/'Axminster' (Pm1a) which indicated that the NC06BGTAG12 resistance gene was allelic or in close linkage with the Pm1 locus. A detached leaf test with ten differential powdery mildew isolates indicated the resistance in NC06BGTAG12 was different from all designated alleles at the Pm1 locus. Further linkage and allelism tests with five other temporarily designated genes in this very complex region will be required before giving a permanent designation to this gene. At this time the gene is given the temporary gene designation MlAG12.

AB Background: One theoretical explanation for the relatively poor performance of Brassica rapa (weed) x Brassica napus (crop) transgenic hybrids suggests that hybridization imparts a negative genetic load. Consequently, in hybrids genetic load could overshadow any benefits of fitness enhancing transgenes and become the limiting factor in transgenic hybrid persistence. Two types of genetic load were analyzed in this study: random/linkage-derived genetic load, and directly incorporated genetic load using a transgenic mitigation (TM) strategy. In order to measure the effects of random genetic load, hybrid productivity (seed yield and biomass) was correlated with crop-and weed-specific AFLP genomic markers. This portion of the study was designed to answer whether or not weed x transgenic crop hybrids possessing more crop genes were less competitive than hybrids containing fewer crop genes. The effects of directly incorporated genetic load (TM) were analyzed through transgene persistence data. TM strategies are proposed to decrease transgene persistence if gene flow and subsequent transgene introgression to a wild host were to occur.
   Results: In the absence of interspecific competition, transgenic weed x crop hybrids benefited from having more crop-specific alleles. There was a positive correlation between performance and number of B. napus crop-specific AFLP markers [seed yield vs. marker number (r = 0.54, P = 0.0003) and vegetative dry biomass vs. marker number (r = 0.44, P = 0.005)]. However under interspecific competition with wheat or more weed-like conditions (i.e. representing a situation where hybrid plants emerge as volunteer weeds in subsequent cropping systems), there was a positive correlation between the number of B. rapa weed-specific AFLP markers and seed yield (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001), although no such correlation was detected for vegetative biomass. When genetic load was directly incorporated into the hybrid genome, by inserting a fitness-mitigating dwarfing gene that that is beneficial for crops but deleterious for weeds (a transgene mitigation measure), there was a dramatic decrease in the number of transgenic hybrid progeny persisting in the population.
   Conclusion: The effects of genetic load of crop and in some situations, weed alleles might be beneficial under certain environmental conditions. However, when genetic load was directly incorporated into transgenic events, e. g., using a TM construct, the number of transgenic hybrids and persistence in weedy genomic backgrounds was significantly decreased.

TI ConservedPrimers 2.0: A high-throughput pipeline for comparative genome
   referenced intron-flanking PCR primer design and its application in

DT Article

AB Background: In some genomic applications it is necessary to design large numbers of PCR primers in exons flanking one or several introns on the basis of orthologous gene sequences in related species. The primer pairs designed by this target gene approach are called "intron-flanking primers" or because they are located in exonic sequences which are usually conserved between related species, "conserved primers". They are useful for large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and marker development, especially in species, such as wheat, for which a large number of ESTs are available but for which genome sequences and intron/exon boundaries are not available. To date, no suitable high-throughput tool is available for this purpose.
   Results: We have developed, the ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline, for designing intron-flanking primers for large-scale SNP discovery and marker development, and demonstrated its utility in wheat. This tool uses non-redundant wheat EST sequences, such as wheat contigs and singleton ESTs, and related genomic sequences, such as those of rice, as inputs. It aligns the ESTs to the genomic sequences to identify unique colinear exon blocks and predicts intron lengths. Intron-flanking primers are then designed based on the intron/exon information using the Primer3 core program or BatchPrimer3. Finally, a tab-delimited file containing intron-flanking primer pair sequences and their primer properties is generated for primer ordering and their PCR applications. Using this tool, 1,922 bin-mapped wheat ESTs (31.8% of the 6,045 in total) were found to have unique colinear exon blocks suitable for primer design and 1,821 primer pairs were designed from these single-or low-copy genes for PCR amplification and SNP discovery. With these primers and subsequently designed genome-specific primers, a total of 1,527 loci were found to contain one or more genome-specific SNPs.
   Conclusion: The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline for designing intron-flanking primers was developed and its utility demonstrated. The tool can be used for SNP discovery, genetic variation assays and marker development for any target genome that has abundant ESTs and a related reference genome that has been fully sequenced. The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline has been implemented as a command-line tool as well as a web application. Both versions are freely available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/ConservedPrimers/.

AB To investigate the nature of plant chromosomes irradiated by heavy-ion beams, the effects of nitrogen (N) and neon (Ne) ion beams on hexaploid wheat chromosomes were compared with those of X-ray Chromosome aberrations, such as short, ring and dicentric chromosomes appeared in high frequency The average numbers of chromosome breaks at LD-50 by irradiation with X-ray, N and Ne ion beams were 32, 20 and 20, respectively These values may be underestimated because chromosome rearrangement without change in chromosome morphology was not counted. Thus, we subsequently used a wheat line with a pair of extra chromosomes from an alien species (Leymus racemosus) and observed the fate of the irradiated marker chromosomes by genomic in situ hybridization This analysis revealed that 50 Gy of neon beam induced about eight times more breaks than those induced by X-ray. This result suggests that heavy-ion beams induce chromosome rearrangement in high frequency rather than loss of gene function. This suggests further that most of the novel mutations produced by ion beam irradiation, which have been used in plant breeding, may not be caused by ordinary gene disruption but by chromosome rearrangements.

AB Polyploidization is a major driver of plant genome evolution and speciation. However, most investigations have focused on allopolyploidization, and little is known about the genetic and epigenetic impact imposed by autopolyploidization. In the present study, an autoploidy series (2x, 3x and 4x) in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) was constructed. The genome structure changes and DNA methylation adjustments at CCGG sites in a genome-wide level were analyzed in the three different autoploidy watermelons by the ISSR, SRAP, and MSAP methods. Compared with diploids, no obvious genetic changes were discovered in autotriploids. Extensive changes occurred in autotetraploids in which sequence eliminations were predominant. However, analysis of DNA methylation level indicated that the total DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between diploid and autotetraploid. Autotriploid showed a trend of low DNA methylation level. It implied that the alterations of DNA methylation levels were not linear with the autopolyploidy level in watermelon. Further analysis suggested that about half of total sites experienced adjustments of DNA methylation patterns in different ploidy watermelons. Interestingly, autotriploid still showed an obvious trend of demethylation. These results indicated some differences from other investigated autopolyploid plants in autopolyploid watermelon. Autotriploid watermelon, in particular, showed unusual characters of genome structure and DNA methylation status, which may be closely associated with the odd-ploidy effect and the excellent traits present in triploid plants.

AB The wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer, is an eriophyoid pest of cereals, and the vector responsible for transmitting wheat streak mosaic virus. Several authors have suggested cryptic species of this mite identified through morphological variation, but this has never been conclusively demonstrated. Here, we use the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene and two nuclear markers (internal transcribed spacer 1 and adenine nucleotide translocase) to show that WCM from Australia consists of at least two separate lineages that may represent putative species. In our study, both WCM variants were widespread and the only erio-phyoids found on wheat varieties. The WCM variants were also found on alternate host plants, including some plants not known to host WCM. These results have implications for the control of this pest within Australian cereal crops.

AB Most elite wheat varieties cannot be crossed kith related species thereby restricting greatly the germplasm that can be used for alien introgression in breeding programs. Inhibition to crossability is controlled genetically and a number of QTL have been identified to date, including the major gene Kr1 oil 5BL and SKr; a strong QTL affecting crossability between wheat and rye on chromosome 5BS. In this study, we used a recombinant SSD population originating from a cross between the poorly crossable cultivar Courtot (Ct) and the crossable line MP98 to characterize the major dominant effect: of SKr and map the gene at the distal end of the chromosome near the 5B homeologous GSP locus. Colinearity with barley and rice was used to saturate the SKr region with new markers and establish orthologous relationships with a 54-kb region on rice chromosome 12. In total, five markers were mapped within a genetic interval of 0.3 cM and 400 kb of BAC contigs were established on both sides of the gene to lay the foundation for snap-based cloning of SKr. Two SSR markers completely linked to SKr were used to evaluate a collection of crossable wheat progenies originating from primary triticale breeding programs. The results confirm the major effect of SKr on crossability and the usefulness of the two markers for the efficient introgression of crossability in elite wheat varieties.

AB Studies on inheritance of fertility are of great importance in wheat breeding. Although Substantial progress has been achieved in molecular characterization or male sterility and fertility restoration recently, little effort has been devoted to female sterility. To identify the gene(s) controlling female sterility in wheat efficiently, an investigation was conducted for the seed setting ratio using a set of F(2) populations derived from the cross between a female sterile line XND126 and an elite cultivar Gaocheng 8901. Bulked segregation analysis (BSA) method and recessive class approach were adopted to screen for SSR markers potentially linked to female fertility gene loci in 2005. Out of 1080 SSRs in wheat genome, eight markers on chromosome 2D showed a clear difference between two disparate bulks and small recombination frequency values, suggesting a strong linkage signal to the sterility gene. Based on the candidate linked markers, partial linkage maps were constructed with Mapmaker 3.0 (EXP) instead of whole genome maps, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was implemented with software QTLNetwork 2.0. A major gene locus designated as taf1, was located on chromosome 2DS. The above result was confirmed by the analysis for 2007 data, and taf1 was identified on the same chromosome 2DS with a confidence interval of 2.4 cM, which Could explain 44-99 % of phenotypic variation. These results provided fundamental information for fine mapping studies and laid the groundwork for wheat fertility genetic studies.

AB "Mal de Rio Cuarto," is the most important virus disease of corn, Zea mays L., in Argentina. It is caused by the Mal de Rio Cuarto virus (family Reoviridae, genus Fijivirus. MRCV), which is a persistent virus transmitted by Delphacodes kuscheli (Fennah 1955) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Because corn is not a natural host of D. kuscheli, it has little protection from this pest. In contrast, wheat, Triticum aestivum L., is one of the main hosts of this vector and a reservoir of MRCV. The aim of this work was to identify genes involved in antixenosis, antibiosis, and tolerance of infestation by D. kuscheli in wheat, which might be used to reduce the population level of this vector on corn. A set of recombinant dihaploid (RDH) lines for chromosome 6A derived from the F(1) cross between 'Chinese Spring' (CS) x 'Chinese Spring (Synthetic 6A)' (S6A) substitution line, was used for mapping. The S6A parental line is resistant to the MRCV vector. Antixenosis, antibiosis, and tolerance were evaluated using conventional tests in controlled environmental conditions. Most of the RDH and S6A showed higher levels of antixenosis against D. kuscheli than the parental line CS. The RDH lines showed highly significant antibiosis in terms of the duration of first, third, and fifth nymphal instars, developmental time (days), survival and fecundity. There were highly significant differences in the tolerance to D. kuscheli based on the chlorophyll content of the first and second leaves, foliar area, and aboveground fresh and dry weights. The duration of the fifth nymphal instar and the developmental period were significantly associated with Xgwm1017 marker loci, located at 48 cM on 6AL. Another quantitative trait locus accounting for the variation in chlorophyll content of the first leaf was associated with the interval between loci Xgwm459 and Xgwm334a, located in the telomeric region of the 6AS chromosome arm. The alleles with positive effects came from S6A. Antibiotic resistance of RDH could be useful for controlling the population increase of the MRCV vector on wheat, because prolonging the duration of development increases the period between two subsequent generations, so reducing the abundance of infective populations colonizing corn.

AB The Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a serious wheat, Triticum aestivum L., and barley, Hordeum vulgare L., pest throughout the small grain-producing areas in the western United States. The virulency and classification of recently described Russian wheat aphid biotypes 1-7 (RWA1-7) were clarified using 24 plant differentials. These seven biotypes had been described previously using various methods and test environments; therefore, the purpose of this study was to test them A under uniform environmental conditions. RWA1 was the least virulent of the biotypes tested, with susceptible ratings observed in five plant differentials and intermediate ratings observed in four plant differentials. RWA4, RWA5, RWA6, and RWA7 had intermediate virulence. RWA4, RWA5, and RWA7 share similar responses, with susceptible responses in six plant differentials and intermediate responses in five plant differentials. Small differences within a few plant differentials separate RWA4, RWA5, and RWA7 RWA6 has susceptible responses with only four plant differentials, but 10 plant differentials had intermediate responses. RWA3 was highly virulent, with susceptible responses in 10 plant differentials and intermediate responses in five plant differentials. RWA2 was the most virulent strain tested with susceptible responses to 12 plant differentials and intermediate responses to five plant differentials. This study has demonstrated that RWA1-7 have different combinations of virulence to the plant differentials tested, thereby confirming previous Russian wheat aphid biotype designations.

AB Most plant pathogens present complex life cycles, in which the clonal reproduction may impede the delimitation of population entities. By studying the genetic structure of the wheat yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (PST), we highlighted difficulties impeding population delimitation in highly clonal species. Despite the high dispersal potential of PST, southern France isolates were shown to be divergent from a northwestern European population. A 2-year survey was performed in the Mediterranean region to assess the geographic distribution of southern isolates: 453 isolates collected in 11 countries were genotyped using 15 simple sequence repeat markers. A subsample was analysed for virulence against 23 resistance genes. The dominant strain in the western Mediterranean region was further studied with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test for a geographic substructure. Both 'individual'- and 'population' centred analyses of polymorphism markers revealed two south-specific groups: a predominant group, with a broad variability and a wide distribution in both western and eastern Mediterranean countries, and a minor group in the western Mediterranean. The east-west gradient of genetic diversity suggested gene flow from the Middle East with subsequent founder effects and genetic divergence, and demonstrated the local survival of a western Mediterranean population. The high frequency of the resistance gene Yr8 observed in cultivars from Tunisia and Algeria may contribute to maintain the north/south structure observed in France. In addition to migration and local adaptation, the dynamics of clonal lineage diversification and replacement should be considered to define population entities in strongly clonal species.

AB Relationships among the currently recognized 11 diploid species within the genus Aegilops have been investigated. Sequence similarity analysis, based upon 363 sequenced 5S rDNA clones from 44 accessions plus 15 sequences retrieved from GenBank, depicted two unit classes labeled the long AE1 and short AE1. Several different analytical methods were applied to infer relationships within haplomes, between haplomes and among the species, including maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of consensus sequences, "total evidence" phylogeny analysis and "matrix representation with parsimony" analysis. None were able to depict suites of markers or unit classes that could discern among the seven haplomes as is observed among established haplomes in other genera within the tribe Triticeae; however, most species could be separated when displayed on gene trees. These results suggest that the haplomes currently recognized are so refined that they may be relegated as sub-haplomes or haplome variants. Amblyopyrum shares the same 5S rDNA unit classes with the diploid Aegilops species suggesting that it belongs within the latter. Comparisons of the Aegilops sequences with those of Triticum showed that the long AE1 unit class of Ae. tauschii shared the clade with the equivalent long D1 unit class, i.e., the putative D haplome donor, but the short AE1 unit class did not. The long AD unit class but not the short, of Ae. speltoides and Ae. searsii both share the clade with the previously identified long {S1 and long G1 unit classes meaning that both Aegilops species can be equally considered putative B haplome donors to tetraploid Triticum species. The semiconserved nature of the nontranscribed spacer in Aegilops and in Triticeae in general is discussed in view that it may have originated by processes of incomplete gene conversion or biased gene conversion or birth-and-death evolution.

AB Stripe rust (yellow rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the best approach for control of the disease. Although the stripe rust resistance in spring wheat cv. Zak has been circumvented by a group of races of the pathogen predominant in the United States since 2000, the resistance genes in Zak were unknown. To identify and map the genes for resistance to stripe rust, Zak was crossed with susceptible wheat genotype 'Avocet Susceptible'. Seedlings of the parents and F(1), F(2), and F(3) progeny were tested with P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races PST-43 and PST-45 under controlled greenhouse conditions. Genetic analysis determined that Zak has a single dominant gene, designated as YrZak, conferring race-specific all-stage resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), and sequence-tagged site (STS) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to YrZak. A linkage group of three RGAP, three SSR, and three STS markers was constructed for YrZak using 205 F(3) lines. Amplification of the complete set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines with RGAP marker Xwgp102 indicated that YrZak is present on chromosome 2B. The three SSR markers further mapped YrZak to the long arm of chromosome 2B. Amplification of chromosome 2B deletion lines with SSR marker Xgwm501 further confirmed that YrZak is on chromosome 2BL. To determine the genetic distance between YrZak and Yr5, which also is present on chromosome 2BL, 300 F(2) plants from cross Zak/Yr5 were tested with PST-43. Six susceptible plants were identified from the F(2) population, indicating that YrZak and Yr5 are approximate to 42 centimorgans apart. The results of race reactions and chromosomal locations indicated that YrZak is different from previously identified genes for resistance to stripe rust. This gene should be useful in monitoring virulence changes in the pathogen population and in studying host-pathogen interactions.

AB In this study two Sources of resistance to Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), both originating from Thinopyrum intermedium, were combined in a single genotype, line ZT, using GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) and a new molecular marker of the partial resistance gene Bdv2. Susceptible wheat cv. Sunstar, the translocation line TC14 carrying Bdv2, the addition line ZH with the group-2 chromosome arm carrying resistance, and line ZT with both resistances were inoculated with five strains of Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV. The tests confirmed the resistance of TC14 and ZH and revealed an additive effect of the two sources of resistance in ZT. The resistance of line ZT was characterized by 1 proportion of infected plants significantly lower than the parental lines TC14 and ZH (42% vs. a mean of 76% for the parents) and a very low virus titre (area under the virus concentration progress curve of 1.2 vs. a mean on 6.3 for the parents).

AB A lesion-mimic phenotype appeared in a segregating population of common wheat cross Yanzhan 1/Zaosui 30. The parents had non-lesion normal phenotypes. Shading treatment and histochemical analyses showed that the lesions were caused by light-dependent cell death and were not associated with pathogens. Studies over two cropping seasons showed that some lines with more highly expressed lesion-mimic phenotypes exhibited significantly lower grain yields than those with the normal phenotype, but there were no significant effects in the lines with weakly expressed lesion-mimic phenotypes. Among yield traits, one-thousand grain weight was the most affected by lesion-mimic phenotypes. Genetic analysis indicated that this was a novel type of lesion mimic, which was caused by interaction of recessive genes derived from each parent. The lm1 (lesion mimic 1) locus from Zaosui 30 was flanked by microsatellite markers Xwmc674 and Xbarc133/Xbarc147 on chromosome 3BS, at genetic distances of 1.2 and 3.8 cM, respectively, whereas lm2 from Yanzhan 1 was mapped between microsatellite markers Xgwm513 and Xksum154 on chromosome 4BL, at genetic distances of 1.5 and 3 cM, respectively. The linked microsatellite makers identified in this study might be useful for evaluating whether potential parents with normal phenotype are carriers of lesion-mimic alleles.

AB Over time, many single, all-stage resistance genes to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are circumvented by race changes in the pathogen. In contrast, high-temperature, adult-plant resistance (HTAP), which only is expressed during the adult-plant stage and when air temperatures are warm, provides durable protection against stripe rust. Our objective was to identify major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for HTAP resistance to stripe rust in the spring wheat cultivar 'Louise'. The mapping population consisted of 188 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a Louise (resistant) by 'Penawawa' (susceptible) cross. F(5:6) lines were evaluated for stripe rust reaction under natural infection in replicated field trials at five locations in the US Pacific Northwest in 2007 and 2008. Infection type (IT) and disease severity were recorded for each RIL 2-4 times per location. In all environments, Penawawa, the susceptible parent, was rated with an IT ranging from 6 to 8 at all growth stages evaluated. In contrast, Louise, the resistant parent, was rated with an IT of 2 or 3 across growth stages. Distribution of IT values was bimodal, indicating a single major gene was affecting the trait. The parents and RIL population were evaluated with 295 polymorphic simple sequence repeat and one single nucleotide polymorphism markers. One major QTL, designated QYrlo.wpg-2BS, associated with HTAP resistance in Louise, was detected on chromosome 2BS (LOD scores ranging from 5.5 to 62.3 across locations and years) within a 16.9 cM region flanked by Xwmc474 and Xgwm148. SSR markers associated with QYrlo.wpg-2BS are currently being used in marker-based forward breeding strategies to transfer the target region into adapted germplasm to improve the durability of resistance in resulting cultivars.

AB Background: Triticum monococcum (2n = 2x = 14) is an ancient diploid wheat with many useful traits and is used as a model for wheat gene discovery. DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) employs a hybridisation-based approach to type thousands of genomic loci in parallel. DArT markers were developed for T. monococcum to assess genetic diversity, compare relationships with hexaploid genomes, and construct a genetic linkage map integrating DArT and microsatellite markers.
   Results: A DArT array, consisting of 2304 hexaploid wheat, 1536 tetraploid wheat, 1536 T. monococcum as well as 1536 T. boeoticum representative genomic clones, was used to fingerprint 16 T. monococcum accessions of diverse geographical origins. In total, 846 polymorphic DArT markers were identified, of which 317 were of T. monococcum origin, 246 of hexaploid, 157 of tetraploid, and 126 of T. boeoticum genomes. The fingerprinting data indicated that the geographic origin of T. monococcum accessions was partially correlated with their genetic variation. DArT markers could also well distinguish the genetic differences amongst a panel of 23 hexaploid wheat and nine T. monococcum genomes. For the first time, 274 DArT markers were integrated with 82 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and two morphological trait loci in a genetic map spanning 1062.72 cM in T. monococcum. Six chromosomes were represented by single linkage groups, and chromosome 4A(m) was formed by three linkage groups. The DArT and SSR genetic loci tended to form independent clusters along the chromosomes. Segregation distortion was observed for one third of the DArT loci. The Ba (black awn) locus was refined to a 23.2 cM region between the DArT marker locus wPt-2584 and the microsatellite locus Xgwmd33 on 1A(m); and the Hl (hairy leaf) locus to a 4.0 cM region between DArT loci 376589 and 469591 on 5A(m).
   Conclusion: DArT is a rapid and efficient approach to develop many new molecular markers for genetic studies in T. monococcum. The constructed genetic linkage map will facilitate localisation and map-based cloning of genes of interest, comparative mapping as well as genome organisation and evolution studies between this ancient diploid species and other crops.

AB Forty-three gene sequences encoding purothionin were characterized from the three species or subspecies of einkorn wheats. These sequences contained 887 bp, among which 92 SNPs including 29 indel loci were detected, giving an average SNP frequency of one SNP per 9.64 bases. According to these sequences, 5 SNP markers were successfully designed, which were used to mine the variations of purothionin genes of 102 einkorn wheat accessions. Based on the 5 detected SNP loci, 102 einkorn wheat accessions could be divided into 21 haplotypes, among which 11 haplotypes contained a single sample. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the purothionin genes from einkorn wheats were more closely related to those from D genome than B genome. Seven out of the 43 gene sequences were assumed to be pseudogenes by the definition of containing in-frame stop codons and small insertions/deletions leading to frameshift. In the remaining 36 amino acid sequences, the 8 Cys and Tyr-13 loci in the mature thionin domain which played important roles in the biological activities were all conserved, whereas there were some varieties occurred in some other important amino acid residues such as Lys and Arg.

AB Understanding the effects of wheat dwarfing genes on the coleoptile length and plant height is crucial for the proper utilization of dwarfing genes in the improvement of wheat yield. Molecular marker analysis combined with pedigree information were used to classify wheat cultivars widely planted in major wheat growing regions in China into different categories based on the dwarfing genes they carried. The effects of the dwarfing genes with different sensitivity to gibberellins (GA(3)) on the coleoptile length and plant height were analyzed. Screening of 129 cultivars by molecular marker analysis revealed that 58 genotypes of wheat contained the dwarfing gene Rht-B1b, 24 genotypes of wheat contained Rht-D1b gene and 73 genotypes of wheat possessed Rht8 gene. In addition, among these 129 cultivars, 35 genotypes of wheat cultivars contained both Rht-B1b and Rht8 genes and 16 genotypes of wheat cultivars contained both Rht-D1b and Rht8 genes. Wheat cultivars with the dwarfing genes Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b were insensitive to GA(3), while the cultivars with the dwarfing gene Rht8 were sensitive to GA3. Most of the wheat genotypes containing combination of Rht8 gene with either Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b gene were insensitive to GA(3). The plant height was reduced by 24.6, 30.4, 28.2, and 32.2%, respectively, for the wheat cultivars containing Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1b + Rht8, and Rht-D1b + Rht8 genes. The plant height was reduced by 14.3% for the wheat cultivar containing GA(3)-sensitive gene Rht8. The coleoptile length was shortened by 25.4, 31.3, 28.4 and 31.3%, respectively, in the wheat cultivars containing Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1b + Rht8 and Rht-D1b + Rht8 genes, while the coleoptile length was shortened only by 6.2% for the wheat cultivar containing Rht8 gene. We conclude that GA(3)-insensitive dwarfing genes (Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b) are not suitable for the wheat improvement in dryland because these two genes have effect on reducing both plant height and coleoptile length. In contrast, GA(3)-sensitive dwarfing gene (Rht8) is a relatively ideal candidate for the wheat improvement since it significantly reduces the plant height of wheat, but has less effect on the coleoptile length.

AB In order to understand the genetic basis for Zeleny sedimentation value (ZSV) of wheat, a doubled haploid (DH) population Huapei 3 x Yumai 57 (Yumai 57 is superior to Huapei 3 for ZSV), and a linkage map consisting of 323 marker loci were used to search QTLs for ZSV. This program was based on mixed linear models and allowed simultaneous mapping of additive effect QTLs, epistatic QTLs, and QTL x environment interactions (QEs). The DH population and the parents were evaluated for ZSV in three field trials. Mapping analysis produced a total of 8 QTLs and 2 QEs for ZSV with a single QTL explaining 0.64-14.39% of phenotypic variations. Four additive QTLs, 4 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and two QEs collectively explained 46.11% of the phenotypic variation (PVE). This study provided a precise location of ZSV gene within the Xwmc 93 and GluD I interval, which was designated as Qzsv-1D. The information obtained in this study should be useful for manipulating the QTLs for ZSV by marker assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programs.

AB Background: Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a starchy root crop grown in tropical and subtropical climates, is the sixth most important crop in the world after wheat, rice, maize, potato and barley. The repertoire of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for cassava is limited and warrants a need for a larger number of polymorphic SSRs for germplasm characterization and breeding applications.
   Results: A total of 846 putative microsatellites were identified in silico from an 8,577 cassava unigene set with an average density of one SSR every 7 kb. One hundred and ninety-two candidate SSRs were screened for polymorphism among a panel of cassava cultivars from Africa, Latin America and Asia, four wild Manihot species as well as two other important taxa in the Euphorbiaceae, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and castor bean (Ricinus communis). Of 168 markers with clean amplification products, 124 (73.8%) displayed polymorphism based on high resolution agarose gels. Of 85 EST-SSR markers screened, 80 (94.1%) amplified alleles from one or more wild species (M epruinosa, M glaziovii, M brachyandra, M tripartita) whereas 13 (15.3%) amplified alleles from castor bean and 9 (10.6%) amplified alleles from leafy spurge; hence nearly all markers were transferable to wild relatives of M esculenta while only a fraction was transferable to the more distantly related taxa. In a subset of 20 EST-SSRs assessed by fluorescence-based genotyping the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 10 with an average of 4.55 per locus. These markers had a polymorphism information content (PIC) from 0.19 to 0.75 with an average value of 0.55 and showed genetic relationships consistent with existing information on these genotypes.
   Conclusion: A set of 124 new, unique polymorphic EST-SSRs was developed and characterized which extends the repertoire of SSR markers for cultivated cassava and its wild relatives. The markers show high PIC values and therefore will be useful for cultivar identification, taxonomic studies, and genetic mapping. The study further shows that mining ESTs is a highly efficient strategy for polymorphism detection within the cultivated cassava gene pool.

AB Early vigour is an important characteristic for direct-seeded rice systems. The genetic control of early vigour was studied using a population of 129 backcross lines derived from a cross between Vandana, an improved indica, and Moroberekan, a traditional japonica. Screening was conducted under controlled conditions in greenhouse and field conditions, and indicators of early vigour, including shoot length, shoot biomass, leaf area, number of roots, root biomass, partitioning coefficients, and growth rates, were measured. Phenotypic correlations suggested that traits that were related and combined could be used to define early vigour. Broad-sense heritability ranged from moderate to high. Many regions were identified containing more than one QTL, suggesting that these traits were controlled by pleiotropic and/or closely linked QTLs. Many QTLs were specific to one environment but G x E interaction analysis showed that the main effects of the environment were large. Differences in temperature between experiments resulted in large differences in seedling age when expressed in thermal time. Different genes (QTLs) may be expected to control growth at different time intervals and thus may partly explain the limited agreement between experiments. However, several regions showed co-location of QTLs from more than one experiment. Comparisons with published studies revealed that these regions were previously identified in different genetic backgrounds and could potentially be used as introgression targets in a marker-assisted breeding program to improve germplasm for direct-seeded environments.

AB The presence and frequency of the resistance gene complex Lr34/Yr18 was investigated in the wheat breeding programme of the Agricultural Research Institute, Martonvasar, Hungary. A total of 226 wheat cultivars and advanced lines from Hungary and other countries were tested with an STS marker, csLV34, to understand the distribution of the Lr34/Yr18 resistance gene complex. A 150-bp PCR fragment was amplified in 64 wheat cultivars and lines with the resistance genes Lr34/Yr18, while a 229-bp fragment was detected in 162 genotypes without Lr34/Yr18. The genotypes with Lr34/Yr18 accounted for 28.3% of the wheat cultivars and advanced lines tested. Among the 128 varieties and breeding lines of Martonvasar origin tested, 34 carried the Lr34/Yr18 genes, with a frequency of 26.6%. The frequency of these genes was 30.6% in genotypes of other origin. The STS marker csLV34 could be used as an effective tool for the marker-assisted selection of Lr34/Yr18 genes in breeding wheat cultivars with durable rust resistance.

AB Tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora triticirepentis) and Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), (caused by Phaeosphaeria nodorum) are destructive diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The majority of currently grown wheat varieties are susceptible to both diseases, presumably because of high pathogenic variability occurring in these fungi or narrow genetic background for resistance in wheat varieties. Therefore, identifying new sources of tan spot and SNB resistance in wheat is imperative. A subset of 825 wheat accessions from the core collection of the National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) of the United States Department of Agriculture, National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) was evaluated for resistance to tan spot and SNB at seedling stage in a growth chamber. On the basis of disease reactions, 88 wheat accessions exhibited resistance to both diseases. Data from the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) were examined for the 88 accessions to identify those that also have resistance to other key diseases and on this basis 28 accessions with multiple resistances were identified. The genetic relationship among the 88 accessions was assessed using resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) primers. Wheat accessions with similar growth habit were grouped together despite differences in country of origin. Associations between agronomic traits and host resistance indicated that winter wheat habit in the studied collection was strongly associated with both SNB and tan spot resistance. This study identified genetically diverse wheat accessions with broad-spectrum resistance that can be used in developing cultivars with high levels of resistance to multiple diseases in wheat breeding programs.

AB Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, was historically one of the most destructive diseases of wheat (Triticum, aestivum L.) worldwide. Deployment of resistant cultivars successfully prevented rust epidemics over the past several decades. Unfortunately, race TTKS (termed Ug99) has emerged in Africa to render several stem-rust-resistance genes ineffective. Sr40, a stem-rust-resistance gene from Triticum timopheevii ssp. armeniacum, was transferred to wheat on translocation chromosome T2BL/2G#2S and provides effective levels of seedling and adult plant resistance against Ug99. Two mapping populations were developed using Ug99-resistant line RL6088 and moderately susceptible to susceptible hard winter wheat cultivars Lakin and 2174. The parents were screened with 83 simple sequence repeats (SSR) from chromosome 2B and the polymorphic markers were analyzed on F(2) populations. F(2) and F(2:3) populations were inoculated with North American stem rust race RKQQ at the seedling stage. Marker locus Xwmc344 was most closely linked to Sr40 (0.7 cM) in the RL6088/Lakin linkage map, followed by Xwmc474 and Xgwm374. Marker locus Xwmc474 was mapped similar to 2.5 cM proximal to Sr40 in the RL6088/2174 population. Xwmc474 and Xwmc661 flanked Sr40 in both populations. Markers linked to Sr40 will be useful for marker-assisted integration and pyramiding of Sr40 into elite wheat breeding lines, and reduction in the size of the T timopheevii segment harboring this gene.

TI Linkage Maps of Wheat Stripe Rust Resistance Genes Yr5 and Yr15 for Use

ID WILD EMMER WHEAT; F-SP TRITICI; UNITED-STATES; MICROSATELLITE;

AB Stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks.) is a serious disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Resistance genes Yr5 and Yr15 are the only known all-stage resistance genes that defeat all stripe rust races currently found in the United States. Previously mapped markers for these genes, however, show limited polymorphism across diverse genotypes and/or map at a distance from the genes, reducing the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection. Our objective was to create new linkage maps for both genes using sequence tagged site (STS) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci and to evaluate closely linked markers across a diverse panel of wheat genotypes. Two recombinant inbred populations created using Avocet-Susceptible as a susceptible parent and Triticum aestivum L. ssp. spelta (L.) Thell. 'Album' and Triticum dicoccoides Koern. as the Yr5 and Yr15 donors, respectively, were evaluated for resistance to multiple races of stripe rust. Molecular markers that had been previously mapped to wheat chromosome 1B (Yr5) or 213 (Yr15) were mapped on the appropriate population. Markers most closely linked to each gene were evaluated against a panel of genotypes collected from active introgression programs in the United States. The Yr5 gene is flanked on the distal side by STS7/8 marker and by Xbarc349 and Xbarc167 on the proximal side, although none of these markers were diagnostic in all backgrounds. For Yr15, Xbarc8 and Xgwm413 appear to be completely linked with the gene in our population, along with resistance gene analog polymorphism marker Xwgp34. These two SSR markers also appear to be diagnostic in all backgrounds tested with one exception (Zak). We have developed linkage maps for both genes and identified several useful SSR and STS markers for introgression of Yr5 and Yr15.

AB Genetic Analysis of Resistance to Soil-Borne Wheat Mosaic Virus Derived from Aegilops tauschii. Euphytica. Soil-Borne Wheat Mosaic Virus (SBWMV), vectored by the soil inhabiting organism Polymyxa graminis, causes damage to wheat (Triticum aestivum) yields in most of the wheat growing regions of the world. In localized fields, the entire crop may be lost to the virus. Although many winter wheat cultivars contain resistance to SBWMV, the inheritance of resistance is poorly understood. A linkage analysis of a segregating recombinant inbred line population from the cross KS96WGRC40 x Wichita identified a gene of major effect conferring resistance to SBWMV in the germplasm KS96WGRC40. The SBWMV resistance gene within KS96WGRC40 was derived from accession TA2397 of Aegilops taushcii and is located on the long arm of chromosome 5D, flanked by microsatellite markers Xcfd10 and Xbarc144. The relationship of this locus with a previously identified QTL for SBWMV resistance and the Sbm1 gene conferring resistance to soil-borne cereal mosaic virus is not known, but suggests that a gene on 5DL conferring resistance to both viruses may be present in T. aestivum, as well as the D-genome donor Ae. tauschii.

AB The 1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation from Petkus rye has contributed substantially to the world wheat production. However, following the breakdown of disease resistance genes in 1RS, its importance for wheat improvement decreased. We have developed a new 1BL.1RS line, R14, by means of crossing rye inbred line L155, selected from Petkus rye to several wheat cultivars. One new gene each, for stripe rust and powdery mildew resistance, located on 1RS of the line R14, are tentatively named YrCn17 and PmCn17. YrCn17 and PmCn17 confer resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes that are virulent on Yr9, and Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici pathotypes virulent on Pm8. These two new resistances, YrCn17 and PmCn17, are now available for wheat improvement programs. The present study indicates that rye cultivars may carry yet untapped variations as potential sources of resistance.

AB Genetic studies were conducted on an European winter wheat cultivar, Beaver, to determine the mode of inheritance of leaf rust resistance at seedling and adult plant growth stages using a recombinant doubled haploid population, Beaver/Soissons. Greenhouse studies indicated the involvement of genes Lr13 and Lr26 in governing leaf rust resistance at seedling growth stages, whereas, adult plant resistance (APR) in the field with pathotypes carrying virulence individually for Lr13 and Lr26 showed trigenic inheritance for the population. Marker regression analysis of adult plant field data indicated the involvement of six significant QTLs (chromosomes 1B, 3B, 3D, 4B, 4D and 5A) in year 2005, four QTLs (1B, 3B, 4B and 5A) in 2006, and six QTLs (1A, 1B, 3B, 4A, 4B and 5A) in 2007 for reducing leaf rust severity. QTLs on chromosomes 1B, 4B and 5A were considered the most important because of their detection across years, whereas QTLs on chromosomes 1A, 3B, 3D and 4A were either inconsistent or non-significant and unexplained. Based on an association of closely linked markers with phenotypic data, putative single gene stocks were identified for each consistent QTL and crossing was initiated to develop populations segregating for each to permit fine mapping of the identified regions.

AB The absence of chromosome 7D in the wheat-Thinopyrum ponticum partial amphiploid BE-I was detected previously by multicolour genomic in situ hybridization, sequential FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) using repetitive DNA probes, and SSR marker analysis. In the present study the previous cytogenetic and SSR marker analyses were expanded to include 25 other SSR markers assigned to wheat chromosomes 7A and 7D to confirm the presence of a 7A.7D translocation and to specify its composition. An almost complete chromosome 7A and a short chromosome segment derived from the terminal region of 7DL were detected, confirming the presence of a terminal translocation involving the distal regions of 7AL and 7DL In both cases the position of the translocation break-point was different from that of known deletion lines. The identification of the 7AL 7DL translocation and its breakpoint position provides a new physical landmark for future physical mapping studies, opening LIP the possibility of more precise localization of genes or molecular markers within the terminal regions of 7DL and 7AL.

AB Expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived simple sequence repeat (cSSR) markers arc important resources for gene discovery and comparative mapping aimed at crop improvement In this study, we developed cSSR markers for Medicago truncatula and assessed their cross-species transferability. We detected 36847 non-redundant sequences ("unigenes") from 198 642 M truncatula EST sequences Mining of microsatellites from the 36 847 unigene sequences (representing similar to 25.8 Mb) revealed 14 637 eSSRs in 11 750 SSR-containing ESTs, and primer pairs were successfully designed for 4 636 (39 5%) Of the 14637 eSSRs, 82.6% were. mononucleolide repeats and the rest (in descending order of abundance) were tri-, di-. penta-, and tetranucleotide repeats. When less stringent SSR detection criteria were used. the frequency of dinucleotide repeal motifs increased more than twofold. and the frequencies of di- (11%) and trinucleotide motif's (10.6%) were almost equal. This demonstrates that the eSSR frequency and distribution were related 10 the choice of search criteria. Forty-one randomly selected primer pairs were validated. and their transferability in three leguminous and three non-leguminous species was assessed The markers showed a high level of transferability in the leguminous (53%-71%) and non-leguminous (33%-44%) species. The validation studies thus demonstrate the utility of the Medicago eSSRs in assessing genomic relationships in both leguminous and non-leguminous species

AB Cloning and phylogenetic analysis of Psy1 genes in common wheat and its relatives would help to understand the genetic diversity and evolution of Psy1 gene in common wheat and its related species. In the present study, common wheat (AABBDD) and eight relative species, including T. urartu (AuAu), T. boeoticum (AmAm), T. monococcum (AmAm), Ae. speltoides (SS), Ae. tauschii (DD), T. dicoccoides (AABB), T. dicoccum (AABB) and T. spelta (AABBDD), were sampled for the isolation of novel alleles at Psy1-A1, Psy1-B1/Psy1-S1 and Psy1-D1 loci corresponding to common wheat Psy1 genes, and 27 new alleles were identified at these loci, designated Psy1-A1f through Psy1-A1k, Psy1-A1m and Psy1-A1n, Psy1-B1h through Psy1-B1m, Psy1-S1a through Psy1-S1c, Psy1-D1a through Psy1-D1j, respectively. The genes contained six exons and five introns, and the sequences of exons were more conserved compared with those of introns. The Psy1-A1 genes encoded a polypeptide of 428 aminoacid residues, with one residue longer than those encoded by Psy1-D1 genes. The Psy1-B1/Psy1-S1 genes encoded four types of polypeptides, with 421 (Psy1-B1h through Psy1-B1j, Psy1-B1l), 427 (Psy1-B1k, Psy1-S1a and Psy1-S1c), 428 (Psy1-B1m), and 429 (Psy1-S1b) aminoacid residues, respectively. Neighbor joining tree was generated based on the gene sequences of the 27 novel alleles and those of the 13 alleles reported previously in common wheat and its relatives. The phylogenetic tree consisted of two subtrees. The subtree I comprised 11 of 14 alleles at Psy1-A1 locus, nine of 16 alleles at Psy1-B1/Psy1-S1 locus, and ten novel alleles at Psy1-D1 locus, while the subtree II included the other three alleles at Psy1-A1 locus, the remaining four Psy1-B1 alleles and three Psy1-S1 alleles. The alleles from different clusters showed high sequence divergences, indicated by various SNPs and InDels (insertion/deletion). The phylogenetic relationships of these allelic variants at the three loci in common wheat and its relatives also supported the hypothesis that common wheat was originated by recurrent hexaploidization events. In addition, 193 Chinese wheat cultivars with different yellow pigment contents were genotyped with two novel STS markers YP7D-1 and YP7D-2. The results indicated that 191 cultivars contained the allele Psy1-D1a, and two had Psy1-D1g.

AB 'Cataldo' (Reg. No. CV-1033, PI 642361) is a soft white spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) developed by the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station and released in spring 2007. Cataldo was tested under experimental numbers A02215S-B-1 and IDO642 and has the pedigree of IDO584/4*'Alturas'. IDO584 carries a new source of resistance to Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)], the gene H25, originally derived from KS92WGRC 20. Cataldo was released for its novel Hessian fly resistance, conferred by the gene H25. The resistance was selected using molecular markers Xgwm610 and Xgwm397 associated with the H25 gene, together with phenotypic testing. Cataldo was released to extend the range of the Alturas genetic background into rainfed production regions of northern Idaho and eastern Washington where Hessian fly is a consistent limitation to production. Cataldo is also earlier and shorter than Alturas and has high-temperature adult-plant resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks.) and end-use quality (cookie and Asian noodles) similar to Alturas.

AB Hard red spring (HRS) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain must have high grain protein concentration (GPC) to maximize market value. The objective of this research was to develop a HRS wheat cultivar with high GPC and durable resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici), a major foliar fungal disease problem of spring wheat. 'Kelse' (Reg. No. CV-1035, PI 653842) HRS wheat was developed and released in July 2008 by the Agricultural Research Center of Washington State University. Kelse was tested under the experimental designations of WA007954, H0100092, and HR98036, which were assigned through progressive generations of advancement. Kelse is a semidwarf cultivar adapted to the intermediate-to-high rainfall (>380 mm average annual precipitation), nonirrigated wheat production regions of Washington State. Kelse was released based on its (i) resistance to the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)], (ii) high-temperature, adult-plant resistance (HTAP) to local races of stripe rust (infection type 0-3), (iii) high GPC, (iv) excellent bread-baking quality, and (v) high grain yield potential in the target production region. Kelse is the first HRS wheat cultivar adapted to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States with HTAP resistance to stripe rust. Based on molecular marker analysis, Kelse has the Lr34/Yr18 and Lr37/Yr17/Sr38 gene clusters for rust resistance. Kelse also has exceptionally high GPC compared with HIRS cultivars currently in production.

AB Powdery mildew significantly affects grain yield and end-use quality of winter wheat in the southern Great Plains. Employing resistance resources in locally adapted cultivars is the most effective means to control powdery mildew. Two types of powdery mildew resistance exist in wheat cultivars, i.e., qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative resistance is controlled by major genes, is race-specific, is not durable, and is effective in seedlings and in adult plants. Quantitative resistance is controlled by minor genes, is non-race-specific, is durable, and is predominantly effective in adult plants. In this study, we found that the segregation of powdery mildew resistance in a population of recombinant inbred lines developed from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Jagger and the resistant cultivar 2174 was controlled by a major QTL on the short arm of chromosome 1A and modified by four minor QTLs on chromosomes 1B, 3B, 4A, and 6D. The major QTL was mapped to the genomic region where the Pm3 gene resides. Using specific PCR markers for seven Pm3 alleles, 2174 was found to carry the Pm3a allele. Pm3a explained 61% of the total phenotypic variation in disease reaction observed among seedlings inoculated in the greenhouse and adult plants grown in the field and subjected to natural disease pressure. The resistant Pm3a allele was present among 4 of 31 cultivars currently being produced in the southern Great Plains. The genetic effects of several minor loci varied with different developmental stages and environments. Molecular markers associated with these genetic loci would facilitate incorporating genetic resistance to powdery mildew into improved winter wheat cultivars.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph: Septoria tritici), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat. We assessed three doubled-haploid (DH) populations derived from Chara (STB-susceptible)/WW2449 (STB-resistant), Whistler (STB-susceptible)/WW1842 (STB-resistant) and Krichauff (STB susceptible)/WW2451 (STB-resistant) for resistance to a single-pycnidium isolate 79.2.1A of M. graminicola at the seedling stage. STB resistance in each of the three DH populations was conditioned by a single major gene designated as StbWW2449, StbWW1842 and StbWW2451. Linkage analyses and physical mapping indicated that the StbWW loci were located on the short arm of chromosome 1B (IBS). Four simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers linked with STB resistance: Xwmc230, Xbarc119b, Xksum045 and Xbarc008 were located to the distal bin of 1BS.sat1BS-4 (FL: 0.52-1.00) in the 1BS physical map. Xwmc230, Xbarc119b and Xksum045 markers, mapped within 7 cM from StbWW were validated for their linkage and predicted the STB resistance with over 94% accuracy in the 79 advanced breeding lines having WW2449 as one of the parents. The marker interval Xwmc230/Xksum045-Xbarc119b also explained up to 38% of the phenotypic variance at the adult plant stage in all three DH mapping populations. These results have proven that SSR markers are useful in monitoring STB resistance both at seedling and adult plant stages and hence are suitable for routine marker-assisted selection in the wheat breeding programs.

AB High resolution melting curve analysis (HRM) measures dissociation of double stranded DNA of a PCR product amplified in the presence of a saturating fluorescence dye. Recently, HRM proved successful to genotype DNA sequence polymorphisms such as SSRs and SNPs based on the shape of the melting curves. In this study, HRM was used for simultaneous screening and genotyping of genic DNA sequence polymorphisms identified in the Lolium perenne F2 mapping population VrnA. Melting profiles of PCR products amplified from previously published gene loci and from a novel gene putatively involved in vernalization response successfully discriminated genotypes in absence of allelic sequence information, and allowed to determine allele segregation in VrnA. Here we introduce the concept of "blind" mapping based on HRM as a powerful, fast and cheap method to map any DNA sequence polymorphisms without prior knowledge of allelic sequences in the key grassland species perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.).

AB Historic collections of biological material are important genetic resources for taxonomic, evolutionary and historical research. In this paper we describe a seed collection dating from 1862 to 1918 maintained at the Swedish Museum of Cultural History. The collection contains over 3000 well-documented seed samples of various agricultural crops, mostly cereals. A subset of 100 samples divided over ten species frequently represented in the collection and a range of ages were tested for germinability and DNA preservation. None of these accessions were found to contain viable seeds. DNA extracted from the seeds was degraded, but the amount of degradation varied between species. DNA quality was evaluated by yield, fragment size and size of amplification product. Quality was highest for DNA extracted from Pisum sativum and Vicia sativa. DNA extracted from Brassica napus, Beta vulgaris and Trifolium pratense was more fragmented, and DNA extracted from Triticum aestivum, Secale sereale, Hordeum vulgare, Avena sativa and Phleum pratense was most degraded. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of ribosomal DNA fragments of up to 700 bp was permitted for most samples in all species. To test whether single-copy nuclear genes could be amplified from the extracted DNA, microsatellite markers were used on the Pisum sativum and Hordeum vulgare samples. Polymorphisms of microsatellite markers were detected between samples for both species. The results show that the 19th-century seed collection can be utilized to infer genetic relationships among obsolete cultivars as well as for other types of genetic research based on sequence or marker analysis.

AB A rye-wheat centric chromosome translocation 1RS.1BL has been widely used in wheat breeding programs around the world. Increased yield of translocation lines was probably a consequence of increased root biomass. In an effort to map loci-controlling root characteristics, homoeologous recombinants of 1RS with 1BS were used to generate a consensus genetic map comprised of 20 phenotypic and molecular markers, with an average spacing of 2.5 cM. Physically, all recombination events were located in the distal 40% of the arms. A total of 68 recombinants was used and recombination breakpoints were aligned and ordered over map intervals with all the markers, integrated together in a genetic map. This approach enabled dissection of genetic components of quantitative traits, such as root traits, present on 1S. To validate our hypothesis, phenotyping of 45-day-old wheat roots was performed in five lines including three recombinants representative of the entire short arm along with bread wheat parents 'Pavon 76' and Pavon 1RS.1BL. Individual root characteristics were ranked and the genotypic rank sums were subjected to Quade analysis to compare the overall rooting ability of the genotypes. It appears that the terminal 15% of the rye 1RS arm carries gene(s) for greater rooting ability in wheat.

AB Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) causes high yield losses in most of the major cereal crops worldwide. A source of very effective resistance was detected within the tetraploid wild species of Hordeum bulbosum. Interspecific crosses between a resistant H. bulbosum accession and H. vulgare cv. 'Igri' were performed to transfer this resistance into cultivated barley. Backcrosses to H. vulgare resulted in offspring which carried a single subterminal introgression of H. bulbosum chromatin on barley chromosome 3HL and proved to be fully resistant to BYDV-PAV, as inferred by ELISA values of zero or close to zero and lack of BYDV symptoms. Genetic analysis indicated a dominant inheritance of the BYDV-PAV resistance factor, which we propose to denote Ryd4 (Hb) . The identity and effect of Ryd4 (Hb) are discussed in relation to other known genes for BYDV resistance or tolerance, as well as the relevance of this gene for resistance breeding in barley.

AB The wheat and rye spike normally bears one spikelet per rachis node, and the appearance of supernumerary spikelets is rare. The loci responsible for the 'multirow spike' or MRS trait in wheat, and the 'monstrosum spike' trait in rye were mapped by genotyping F-2 populations with microsatellite markers. Both MRS and the 'monstrosum' trait are under the control of a recessive allele at a single locus. The Mrs1 locus is located on chromosome 2DS, co-segregating with the microsatellite locus Xwmc453. The placement of flanking microsatellite loci into chromosome deletion bin 2DS-5 (FL 0.47-1.0) delimited the physical location of Mrs1 to the distal half of chromosome arm 2DS, within the gene rich region 2S0.8. The Mo1 locus maps about 10 cM from the centromere on chromosome arm 2RS. The similar effect on phenotype of mo1 and mrs1, together with their presence in regions of conserved synteny, suggest that they may well be members of an orthologous set of Triticeae genes governing spike branching. The practical importance of the MRS spike is that it produces more spikelets per spike, and thereby enhances the sink capacity of wheat, which is believed to limit the yield potential of the crop.

AB The locus Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 confers partial and durable resistance against the devastating fungal pathogens leaf rust, stripe rust, and powdery mildew. In previous studies, this broad-spectrum resistance was shown to be controlled by a single gene which encodes a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter. Alleles of resistant and susceptible cultivars differed by only three sequence polymorphisms and the same resistance haplotype was found in the three independent breeding lineages of Lr34/Yr18/Pm38. Hence, we used these conserved sequence polymorphisms as templates to develop diagnostic molecular markers that will assist selection for durable multi-pathogen resistance in breeding programs. Five allele-specific markers (cssfr1-cssfr5) were developed based on a 3 bp deletion in exon 11 of the Lr34-gene, and one marker (cssfr6) was derived from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 12. Validation of reference genotypes, well characterized for the presence or absence of the Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 resistance locus, demonstrated perfect diagnostic values for the newly developed markers. By testing the new markers on a larger set of wheat cultivars, a third Lr34 haplotype, not described so far, was discovered in some European winter wheat and spelt material. Some cultivars with uncertain Lr34 status were re-assessed using the newly derived markers. Unambiguous identification of the Lr34 gene aided by the new markers has revealed that some wheat cultivars incorrectly postulated as having Lr34 may possess as yet uncharacterised loci for adult plant leaf and stripe rust resistance.

AB In this paper, we present an innovative and powerful approach for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in experimental populations. This deviates from the traditional approach of (composite) interval mapping which uses a QTL profile to simultaneously determine the number and location of QTL. Instead, we look before we leap by employing separate detection and localization stages. In the detection stage, we use an iterative variable selection process coupled with permutation to identify the number and synteny of QTL. In the localization stage, we position the detected QTL through a series of one-dimensional interval mapping scans. Results from a detailed simulation study and real analysis of wheat data are presented. We achieve impressive increases in the power of QTL detection compared to composite interval mapping. We also accurately estimate the size and position of QTL. An R library, DLMap, implements the methods described here and is freely available from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).

AB Simple molecular marker assays underpin routine plant breeding and research activities in many laboratories worldwide. With the rapid growth of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resources for many important crop plants, the availability of routine, low-tech marker assays for genotyping SNPs is of increased importance. In this study, we demonstrate that temperature-switch PCR (TSP) supports the rapid development of robust, allele-specific PCR markers for codominant SNP genotyping on agarose gel. A total of 87 TSP markers for assessing gene diversity in barley were developed and used to investigate the efficacy for marker development, assay reliably and genotyping accuracy. The TSP markers described provide good coverage of the barley genome, are simple to use, easy to interpret and score, and are amenable to assay automation. They provide a resource of informative SNP markers for assessing genetic relationships among individuals, populations and gene pools of cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and its wild relative H. spontaneum K. Koch. TSP markers provide opportunities to use available SNP resources for marker-assisted breeding and plant genetic research, and to generate information that can be integrated with SNP data from different sources and studies. TSP markers are expected to provide similar advantages for any animal or plant species.

The Sh4 homoeologue copies were detected in Echinochloa oryzicola, Echinochloa crus-galli, Echinochloa stagnina, Echinochloa colona, and Echinochloa crus-pavonis. Amino acid sequence differences did not lead to a functional change in the sh4 gene between the shattering and non-shattering types in E. crus-galli, E. oryzicola, and E. colona. A phylogenetic analysis of the homoeologous copy sequences indicated a genomic relationship between the Asian Echinochloa species and supported that the allohexaploid E. crus-galli shares two genomes with its parental donor, E. oryzicola. The Asian perennial tetraploid species, E. stagnina, shares one genome with E. oryzicola and possesses an unknown genome. Echinochloa crus-pavonis, from the New World, shows a close affinity of two genomes with E. crus-galli and E. oryzicola. Echinochloa colona showed distant affinities in all homoeologous copies.

AB The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many important physiological and developmental processes in plants. The objective of this study was to clone the ABA 8'-hydroxylase gene in common wheat. In the present study, we used the cDNA sequence of barley HvCYP707A1 gene (GenBank accession no. AB239299) as a probe for BLAST search against the common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) EST database in GenBank. All wheat ESTs sharing high similarity with the reference gene were subjected to contig assembly. Primers were designed based on the constructed contigs to clone the wheat CYP707A1 gene, designated as TaCYP707A1. The genomic DNA sequence of TaCYP707A1 gene comprised five exons and four introns, with a size of 2 225 bp. The corresponding cDNA sequence of TaCYP707A1 was 1 737 bp, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1 431 bp, a 42-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and a 264-bp 3'UTR, with 94.9% of identical sequences to HvCYP707A1 gene (AB239299). The neighbor joining tree indicated that the deduced amino acid sequences of TaCYP707A1 gene was highly similar to those of barley and rice. The TaCYP707A1 gene was located on chromosome 6BL using a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and ditelosomic line 6BS. These results will be of high importance in understanding of molecular mechanism of ABA catabolism.

AB Key message New SNP markers that can be used for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning saturate the chromosome region carrying SrCad, a wheat gene that confers resistance to Ug99 stem rust.
   Abstract Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. Development of cultivars with effective resistance has been the primary means to control this disease, but the appearance of new virulent strains such as Ug99 has rendered most wheat varieties vulnerable. The stem rust resistance gene SrCad located on chromosome arm 6DS has provided excellent resistance to various strains of Ug99 in field nurseries conducted in Njoro, Kenya since 2005. Three genetic populations were used to identify SNP markers closely linked to the SrCad locus. Of 220 SNP markers evaluated, 27 were found to be located within a 2 cM region surrounding SrCad. The diagnostic potential of these SNPs was evaluated in a diverse set of 50 wheat lines that were primarily of Canadian origin with known presence or absence of SrCad. Three SNP markers tightly linked proximally to SrCad and one SNP that co-segregated with SrCad were completely predictive of the presence or absence of SrCad. These markers also differentiated SrCad from Sr42 and SrTmp which are also located in the same region of chromosome arm 6DS. These markers should be useful in marker-assisted breeding to develop new wheat varieties containing SrCad-based resistance to Ug99 stem rust.

AB Key message A new stem rust resistance gene Sr59 from Secale cereale was introgressed into wheat as a 2DS center dot 2RL Robertsonian translocation.
   Abstract Emerging new races of the wheat stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici), from Africa threaten global wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. To broaden the resistance spectrum of wheat to these widely virulent African races, additional resistance genes must be identified from all possible gene pools. From the screening of a collection of wheat-rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome substitution lines developed at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, we described the line 'SLU238' 2R (2D) as possessing resistance to many races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, including the widely virulent race TTKSK (isolate synonym Ug99) from Africa. The breakage-fusion mechanism of univalent chromosomes was used to produce a new Robertsonian translocation: T2DS.2RL. Molecular marker analysis and stem rust seedling assays at multiple generations confirmed that the stem rust resistance from 'SLU238' is present on the rye chromosome arm 2RL. Line TA5094 (#101) was derived from 'SLU238' and was found to be homozygous for the T2DS.2RL translocation. The stem rust resistance gene on chromosome 2RL arm was designated as Sr59. Although introgressions of rye chromosome arms into wheat have most often been facilitated by irradiation, this study highlights the utility of the breakage-fusion mechanism for rye chromatin introgression. Sr59 provides an additional asset for wheat improvement to mitigate yield losses caused by stem rust.

AB Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an effective approach for the identification of marker-trait associations (MTA) using more diverse germplasm not constrained by specific crossing. This study used a collection of 327 advanced indica breeding lines and varieties genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing method and phenotyped in eight environments to identify MTA for grain yield (GY) and 10 related traits. The current panel of indica breeding lines were divided into two subpopulations by three analytical methods including STRUCTURE, principal component analysis (PCA) and neighbour joining (NJ) tree. STRUCTURE and PCA gave the same classification of genotypes while the NJ tree results are slight difference in assigning genotypes to subpopulation from STRCUTURE and PCA. Wide variation was observed for all the 11 traits in the whole panel and the two subpopulations inferred by STRUCTURE analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that LD decay varied across the chromosomes and average pairwise squared correlation coefficient (r(2)) dropped to half of its maximum value (r(2)=0.25) within a physical distance of 200 kb in the whole population. A MLM model controlling both population structure and cryptic relatedness was chosen to identify MTA for all the 11 tested traits. A total of 452 MTA that were delineated into 43 QTL were identified for all traits but PB, SB, and SR with 39 QTL being not reported before. Three QTL on chromosome 6, 9 and 12 were identified for GY but only in DS2. The numbers of QTL identified for the remaining traits varied from two to 26. Most of the detected QTL were found in only one environment. Four QTL were located in the regions containing genes/QTL previously identified for other related traits. The effects of identified QTL were relatively small with the highest percentage of phenotypic variance explained by a single QTL being 9.6%. The identified QTL are directly relevant to and can be more effectively used in breeding programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In line with current regulations and in order to ensure the feasible coexistence of genetically modified (GM) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars with conventional cultivars, it is essential to assess the potential for pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF). Experiments measuring gene flow in cotton were carried out in two locations in the province of Seville, in southern Spain's region of Andalusia, first in Penaflor in 2007 and then in Lebrija in 2009 and again in 2010. In 2009 and 2010, the experiment consisted of a 4 ha square field of non-GM cotton, in the middle of which a 40 x 40 m central plot of GM cotton was sown. The GM cotton used as pollen source was glyphosate-tolerant cotton and a non-GM counterpart was used as pollen receptor. In 2007, the non-GM field was a 4.8 ha rectangle (120 x 400 m) in the middle of which a 20 x 100 m plot was sown with the GM insect-protected Bt Cotton, which displayed tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate due to the presence of the selectable marker gene. Recipient and donor cultivars went into bloom in synchrony and uniformly. The progeny of non-GM plants grown at distances of from 1 m to 50 m along eight directions radiating from the central GM plot (up to 150 m in some directions) was screened for herbicide resistance to measure PMGF frequency. In the Lebrija experiments, putative hybrids recorded after glyphosate screening were confirmed as true hybrids by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), while glufosinate was used for herbicide screening and Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to confirm resistance of the Penaflor hybrids. In all cases, PMGF declined exponentially as distance from the pollen source increased. Outcrossing differed among locations, with highest values obtained in 2007 in Penaflor, where the average across the eight directions was 3% (0.9-9.8%) at 1 m from the GM source, and with values of 0.2% (0-0.5%) and 0.06% (0-0.3%), at 10 m and 25 m respectively. In Lebrija, these values, averaged across directions and years, were 0.17% (0-0.64) at 1 m, 0.19% (0-0.98) at 10 m and 0.01% (0-0.16) at 25 m. Although experimental design, cultivars, insect vectors and environmental conditions could be sources of variation, under the circumstances of this assay, PMGF values at 10 m distance were always below the 0.9% threshold based on seeds permissible under European Union (EU) regulation.

AB Lack of resistance to pink snow mould (Microdochium nivale) is a major constraint for adaptation of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) to continental regions with long-lasting snow cover at higher latitudes. Almost all investigations of genetic variation in resistance have been performed using cold acclimated plants. However, there may be variation in resistance mechanisms that are functioning independently of cold acclimation. In this study our aim was to identify candidate genes involved in such resistance mechanisms. We first characterized variation in resistance to M. nivale among non-acclimated genotypes from the Norwegian cultivar 'Fagerlin' based on relative regrowth and fungal quantification by real-time qPCR. One resistant and one susceptible genotype were selected for transcriptome analysis using paired-end sequencing by Illumina Hiseq 2000. Transcriptome profiles, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicate that defense response related genes are differentially expressed between the resistant and the susceptible genotype. A significant up-regulation of defense related genes, as well as genes involved in cell wall cellulose metabolic processes and aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity, was observed in the resistant genotype. The candidate genes identified in this study might be potential molecular marker resources for breeding perennial ryegrass cultivars with improved resistance to pink snow mould.

ID GENOME
AB Background: The increase in human populations around the world has put pressure on resources, and as a consequence food security has become an important challenge for the 21st century. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important crops in human and livestock diets, and the development of wheat varieties that produce higher yields, combined with increased resistance to pests and resilience to changes in climate, has meant that wheat breeding has become an important focus of scientific research. In an attempt to facilitate these improvements in wheat, plant breeders have employed molecular tools to help them identify genes for important agronomic traits that can be bred into new varieties. Modern molecular techniques have ensured that the rapid and inexpensive characterisation of SNP markers and their validation with modern genotyping methods has produced a valuable resource that can be used in marker assisted selection. CerealsDB was created as a means of quickly disseminating this information to breeders and researchers around the globe.
   Description: CerealsDB version 3.0 is an online resource that contains a wide range of genomic datasets for wheat that will assist plant breeders and scientists to select the most appropriate markers for use in marker assisted selection. CerealsDB includes a database which currently contains in excess of a million putative varietal SNPs, of which several hundreds of thousands have been experimentally validated. In addition, CerealsDB also contains new data on functional SNPs predicted to have a major effect on protein function and we have constructed a web service to encourage data integration and high-throughput programmatic access.
   Conclusion: CerealsDB is an open access website that hosts information on SNPs that are considered useful for both plant breeders and research scientists. The recent inclusion of web services designed to federate genomic data resources allows the information on CerealsDB to be more fully integrated with the WheatIS network and other biological databases.

AB Background: Cultivated barley belongs to the tertiary genepool of hexaploid wheat. Genes of interest can be transferred from barley into wheat through wide hybridization. The application of wheat-barley introgression lines could provide an excellent tool for the transfer of earliness, favourable amino acid composition, biotic stress resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, or good tillering ability into wheat.
   Results: A set of 10 wheat-barley ditelosomic addition lines (2HS, 2HL, 3HS, 3HL, 4HS, 4HL, 6HS, 6HL, 7HS and 7HL) was developed from the progenies of an Asakaze/Manas wheat-barley hybrid produced in Martonvasar, Hungary. The addition lines were selected from self-fertilized plants of the BC2F2-BC2F4 generations using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA probes [HvT01, (GAA)(7) and centromere-specific (AGGGAG)(4) probes]. The cytogenetic identification was confirmed using barley arm-specific SSR and STS markers. The ditelosomic additions were propagated in the phytotron and in the field, and morphological parameters (plant height, tillering, length of the main spike, number of seeds/spike and seeds/plant, and spike characteristics) were described. In addition, the salt stress response of the ditelosomic additions was determined.
   Conclusions: The six-rowed winter barley cultivar Manas is much better adapted to Central European environmental conditions than the two-rowed spring barley Betzes previously used in wheat-barley crosses. The production of wheat-barley ditelosomic addition lines has a wide range of applications both for breeding (transfer of useful genes to the recipient species) and for basic research (mapping of barley genes, genetic and evolutionary studies and heterologous expression of barley genes in the wheat background).

TI Major Gene for Field Stem Rust Resistance Co-Locates with Resistance

AB Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis (Pgt), is a damaging disease of wheat that can be controlled by utilizing effective stem rust resistance genes. ` Thatcher' wheat carries complex resistance to stem rust that is enhanced in the presence of the resistance gene Lr34. The purpose of this study was to examine APR in ` Thatcher' and look for genetic interactions with Lr34. A RIL population was tested for stem rust resistance in field nurseries in Canada, USA, and Kenya. BSA was used to find SNP markers associated with reduced stem rust severity. A major QTL was identified on chromosome 3BL near the centromere in all environments. Seedling testing showed that Sr12 mapped to the same region as the QTL for APR. The SNP markers were physically mapped and the region carrying the resistance was searched for sequences with homology to members of the NB-LRR resistance gene family. SNP marker from one NB-LRR-like sequence, NB-LRR3 co-segregated with Sr12. Two additional populations, including one that lacked Lr34, were tested in field nurseries. NB-LRR3 mapped near the maximum LOD for reduction in stem rust severity in both populations. Lines from a population that segregated for Sr12 and Lr34 were tested for seedling Pgt biomass and infection type, as well as APR to field stem rust which showed an interaction between the genes. We concluded that Sr12, or a gene closely linked to Sr12, was responsible for ` Thatcher'-derived APR in several environments and this resistance was enhanced in the presence of Lr34.

AB In this study, a new substitution line, 12-5-1, with 42 chromosomes that was derived from BC3F2 descendants of the hybridization between Triticum aestivum cv. CN19 and Aegilops biuncialis was created and reported. The 12-5-1 was immune to both powdery mildew and stripe rust and has stable fertility. Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that 12-5-1 was a substitution line 1M(b)(1B). The seed storage protein electrophoresis showed that 12-5-1 presented high molecular weight glutenin subunits (2 + 12) of CN19 and a new subunit designated as M which apparently originated from parent Ae. biuncialis, and absent 7 + 8 subunits. Additionally, the flour quality parameters showed that the protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, wet gluten content, and grain hardness and mixing time of 12-5-1 were signifiantly higher than those of its parent CN19. Moreover, 5 pairs of the chromosome 1M(b)-specifi polymerase chain reaction-based landmark unique gene markers, TNAC1021, TNAC1026, TNAC1041, TNAC1-02 and TNAC1-04, were also obtained. The new substitution line 1M(b)(1B) 12-5-1 could be a valuable source for wheat improvement, especially for wheat end product quality and resistance to disease.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici, is one of the major diseases of wheat in Kazakhstan. To effectively use leaf rust resistance genes (Lr), it is important for breeders to know the resistance genotype in current cultivars. In this study, 30 winter wheat entries grown and/or produced in Kazakhstan were investigated using molecular markers to determine the presence and absence of eight important Lr genes. Molecular screening of these genotypes showed contrasting differences in the frequencies of these genes. Among the 30 entries, 17 carried leaf rust resistance gene Lr1, six had Lr26 and Lr34, and Lr10 and Lr37 were found in three cultivars. Two single cultivars separately carried Lr19 and Lr68, while Lr9 was not detected in any genotypes in this study. Field evaluation demonstrated that two of the most frequent two genes (Lr1 and Lr26) to be ineffective. While Lr34 provided some protection, the remaining effective Lr genes were found only in few genotypes: Lr37 occurred in Kazakh genotypes L-1090 and Krasnovodapadskaya 210 and in the US cultivar Madsen; Lr19 and Lr68 were likely present only in Russian and Kazakh cultivars, Pallada and Yegemen, respectively. The highest resistance over three years of leaf rust testing was found in Kazakh cultivars, Karasay, Krasnovodapadskaya 210, L-1090, Arap and Yegmen, foreign cultivars Madsen, Pallada and the control Parula (Lr68). Data may assist breeders to incorporate effective Lr genes into new cultivars.

AB Molecular markers associated with known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for type 2 resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in bi-parental mapping population usually have more than two alleles in breeding populations. Therefore, understanding the association of each allele with FHB response is particularly important to marker-assisted enhancement of FHB resistance. In this paper, we evaluated FHB severities of 192 wheat accessions including landraces and commercial varieties in three field growing seasons, and genotyped this panel with 364 genome-wide informative molecular markers. Among them, 11 markers showed reproducible marker-trait association (p < 0.05) in at least two experiments using a mixed model. More than two alleles were identified per significant marker locus. These alleles were classified into favorable, unfavorable and neutral alleles according to the normalized genotypic values. The distributions of effective alleles at these loci in each wheat accession were characterized. Mean FHB severities increased with decreased number of favorable alleles at the reproducible loci. Chinese wheat landraces and Japanese accessions have more favorable alleles at the majority of the reproducible marker loci. FHB resistance levels of varieties can be greatly improved by introduction of these favorable alleles and removal of unfavorable alleles simultaneously at these QTL-linked marker loci.

AB Wheat stripe rust is a destructive disease that affects most wheat-growing areas worldwide. Resistance genes from related species and genera add to the genetic diversity available to wheat breeding programs. The stripe rust-resistant introgression line H9020-17-25-6-4 was developed from a cross of resistant Psathyrostachys huashanica with the susceptible wheat cultivar 7182. H9020-17-25-6-4 is resistant to all existing Chinese stripe rust races, including the three most widely virulent races, CYR32, CYR33, and V26. We attempted to characterize this new line by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and genetic analysis. GISH using P. huashanica genomic DNA as a probe indicated that the translocated segment was too small to be detected. Genetic analysis involving F-1, F-2, and F2: 3 materials derived from a cross of Mingxian 169 and H9020-17-25-6-4 indicated that a single dominant gene from H9020-17-25-6-4, temporarily designated YrHu, conferred resistance to CYR29 and CYR33. A genetic map consisting of four simple sequence repeat, two sequence-tagged site (STS), and two sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers was constructed. YrHu was located on the short arm of chromosome 3A and was about 0.7 and 1.5 cM proximal to EST-STS markers BG604577 and BE489244, respectively. Both the gene and the closely linked markers could be used in marker-assisted selection.

AB Leaf rust of wheat, caused by Puccinia triticina, is an important disease throughout the world. The adult plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr48 reported in CSP44 was previously mapped in chromosome 2B, but the marker-gene association was weak. In this study, we confirmed the location of Lr48 to be in the short arm of chromosome 2B and identified closely linked markers suitable for use in breeding. The CSP44/WL711 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (90 lines) showed monogenic segregation for Lr48. Twelve resistant and 12 susceptible RILs were used for selective genotyping using an iSelect 90K Infinium SNP assay. Closely linked SNPs were converted into Kompetitive allele-specific primers (KASP) and tested on the parental lines. KASP markers giving clear clusters for alternate genotypes were assayed on the entire RIL population. SNP markers IWB31002, IWB39832, IWB34324, IWB72 894 and IWB36920 co-segregated with Lr48 and the marker IWB70147 was mapped 0.3 cM proximal to this gene. Closely linked KASP markers were tested on a set of Australian and Nordic wheat genotypes. The amplification of SNP alleles alternate to those linked with Lr48 in the majority of the Australian and Nordic wheat genotypes demonstrated the usefulness of these markers for marker-assisted pyramiding of Lr48 with other rust resistance genes.

AB Seed dormancy is a key domestication trait for major crops, which is acquired in long-term systems development processes and enables the survival of plants in adverse natural conditions. It is a complex trait under polygenic control and is affected by endogenous and environmental factors. In the present study, a major seed dormancy QTL in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), qDor7, detected previously, was fine mapped using a large, multi-generational population. The qDor7 locus was delimited to a 96-kb region which contains 16 predicted gene models. These results lay a solid foundation for cloning qDor7. In addition, the functional markers tightly linked to the seed dormancy QTL may be used in marker-assisted selection for seed dormancy in sorghum.

AB Global wheat production is constrained by rust diseases and deployment of combinations of genetically diverse sources of resistance in new cultivars is accepted as a preferred means of rust control. This investigation was planned to identify new genomic regions contributing towards resistance to three rust diseases under field conditions in a W195/BT-Schomburgk Selection (BTSS) RIL population. The RIL population was assessed for variation in stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust responses at two locations during 2012 and 2013 crop seasons and was subjected to DArTseq genotyping. Linkage map was constructed using 3439 DArTseq markers with an average marker density of 2.7 cM. Composite interval mapping detected three QTL each for stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust resistance in W195/BTSS RIL population. Two consistent QTL for stripe rust, QYr.sun-3BS and QYr.sun-4DL, were contributed by W195 and one inconsistent QTL, QYr.sun-7AS, by BTSS. In the case of leaf rust QLr.sun-2BS and QLr.sun-3BS were contributed by BTSS and QLr.sun-4DL by W195. Based on seedling tests, QLr.sun-2BS was demonstrated to be Lr23. BTSS carried stem rust QTL; QSr.sun-2BL and QSr.sun-6AS and QSr.sun-4DL was contributed by W195. QSr.sun-6AS corresponded to stem rust resistance gene Sr8a carried by BTSS. The collocated QTL for all three rust diseases in chromosome 4D corresponded to the plieotropic locus Lr67/Yr46/Sr55/Pm46 based on genotyping with a linked SNP marker. Interaction among QTL to condition lower rust responses was also demonstrated. QYr.sun-3BS, QLr.sun-3BS and QSr.sun-2BL represent new rust resistance loci.

AB The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with grain yield (GY) in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross between two elite soft red winter wheat (SRWW) cultivars ('Pioneer 26R61' and 'AGS2000'). The RIL population was grown from 2011 to 2014 in 12 site-year combinations throughout the southeastern US. Overall, AGS2000 was the higher yielding parental line, out-performing 26R61 in seven of the 12 environments. Mean GY for the RILs ranged from 3.39 to 7.16 t ha(-1) with significant genotype, environment and genotype by environmental interaction effects. Nine stable QTL were detected for yield, explaining up to 53 % of the phenotypic variation when fit into a multiple-QTL model. The QTL with the largest effect was detected at the Vrn-B1 locus with the short vernalization winter allele from AGS2000 favorable for yield. In addition, vrn-B1 acted additively with a region on chromosome 2B near the Ppd-B1 locus, indicating that a shorter vernalization requirement combined with the Ppd-B1b allele for photoperiod sensitivity may play a key role in adaptation of SRWW to the southern US. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers linked to additional QTL on chromosomes 3A and 3B were in agreement with a previous genome-wide association study in spring wheat, confirming the importance of these regions for yield across environments and germplasm pools. Overall the stable QTL were more predictive of GY compared to individual site-year QTL, indicating that a targeted QTL approach can be utilized by breeding programs to enrich for favorable loci.

AB Bread-making quality is a core trait for wheat breeding programs. Recently, the expression of a novel gene named wheat bread making (wbm) gene has been associated with good bread-making quality. In this study, 54 historical and modern bread wheat genotypes from CIMMYT were screened by PCR marker for the presence of the allele associated with high wbm expression. Eight of the 54 wheat genotypes tested positive for the wbm allele and the genotype Waxwing was identified as the most likely donor of the allele in part of CIMMYT germplasm. The wbm allele had a significant effect on overall gluten quality, gluten strength, gluten extensibility and bread-making quality, although its effect was smaller than the effects of other quality related genes as Glu-D1, Glu-B1 or the negative effect of the 1BL.1RS translocation. The wbm allele was associated with higher values of the traits mentioned but not with higher protein content. The identification of this new wbm gene/protein is a step forward in understanding wheat quality genetic control. Implementation of marker assisted selection in breeding programs to detect the wbm allele is highly recommended.

AB The "Gumbai" wheat landraces of are a distinctive group of Japanese common wheat landraces. They originated in the Yamanashi region of Japan and are characterized by compact spikes, which were called "Gumbai" in the Japanese language. It is well known that the spikes of club wheat (Triticum compactum Host, 2n = 6x = 42, BBAADD genome) are governed by the dominant allele of the compactum (C) locus. We were interested to determine if the compact spike trait in "Gumbai" landraces is controlled either by the gene on chromosome 2D or by an orthologous gene. Five F-2 hybrid populations of 'Novosibirskaya 67' (N67)/"Gumbai" landraces segregated in 3 compact spike: 1 normal ratios. We tentatively designated the gene C (g) (Compact spike of Gumbai) for "Gumbai" landraces. The C (g) gene was not allelic to the C locus on chromosome 2D, or the Cp locus on chromosome 5A. In an F-2 population of N67/'Nakate Gumbai', there was linkage among C (g) and microsatellite loci Xgwm47, Xhbg410 and Xhbg440. Deletion mapping, showed that Xhbg410 and Xhbg440 were located across bins 2BL-7 0.48-0.69 and 2BL-1 0.69-0.89. These results indicated that the C (g) gene governing compact spike lies near breakpoint 0.69 in chromosome arm 2BL. The C (g) gene was located in the orthologous region of a spike compactness QTL in chromosome arm 2AL of wild emmer.

AB Development of wheat-alien translocation lines has facilitated practical utilization of alien species in wheat improvement. The production of a compensating Triticum aestivum-Thinopyrum bessarabicum whole-arm Robertsonian translocation (RobT) involving chromosomes 6D of wheat and 6E(b) of Th.bessarabicum (2n=2x=14, (EEb)-E-b) through the mechanism of centric breakage-fusion is reported here. An F-2 population was derived from plants double-monosomic for chromosome 6D and 6E(b) from crosses between a DS6E(b)(6D) substitution line and bread wheat cultivar Roushan' (2n=6x=42, AABBDD) as female parent. Eighty F-2 genotypes (L1-L80) were screened for chromosome composition. Three PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers specific to chromosomes 6D and 6E(b) were used for screening the F-2 plants. One plant with a T6E(b)S.6DL centric fusion (RobT) was identified. A homozygous translocation line with full fertility was recovered among F-3 families and verified with genomic insitu hybridization (GISH). Grain micronutrient analysis showed that the DS6E(b)(6D) substitution line and T6E(b)S.6DL stock have higher Fe and Zn contents than the recipient wheat cultivar Roushan'.

AB Seed quality for both germination in the next generation and for human consumption is adversely affected due to preharvest sprouting in peanut. It also makes seeds more vulnerable to infection by a number of pathogens. Therefore, it is desirable to have 2-3weeks of fresh seed dormancy (FSD) in the peanut varieties. In this context, one F-2 population was developed from a cross between non-dormant (ICGV 00350) and dormant (ICGV 97045) genotypes. Phenotyping of this population showed control of the trait by two recessive genes. In parallel, genotyping of the population with Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and DArT-seq markers provided a genetic map with 1152 loci covering a map distance of 2423.12cM and map density of 2.96cM/loci. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified two major QTLs, namely qfsd-1 and qfsd-2 explaining 22.14% and 71.21% of phenotypic variation, respectively. These QTLs, after validation in different genetic backgrounds, may be useful for molecular breeding for FSD in peanut.

AB Hairiness is a common character in planta. Glume hairiness (Hg) is present in the full spectrum of bread wheat and its close relatives and was mainly studied in phenotypic diversity, species evolution, and mapping as a morphological marker. Previous studies indicated that Hg was controlled by a single dominant gene Hg on the short arm of chromosome 1A. However, to date, systematic and comprehensive study of Hg is not available; and markers flanking Hg were rather limited as well, hindering the fine mapping and even cloning of this gene. In the study reported here, aiming at genetically analyze Hg gene systematically, a linkage map of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) generated from the cross between the Tibetan semi-wild wheat (Triticum aestivum subsp. tibetanum Shao) Q1028 and a cultivated wheat Zhengmai 9023 (ZM9023) was constructed using diversity array technology (DArT) and reported simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Five SSR markers (saufc2, saufc9, saufc17, saufc25, saufc90) were further developed to accurately locate Hg in this study. Of these five SSR markers all linked to Hg, saufc2 was genetically most closed to Hg with a distance of 1.6 cM. The effectiveness of the five newly developed SSR markers were validated in another RIL derived from Q1028 and a cultivated line 99E18. To our knowledge, this is the first report on fine mapping of Hg in bread wheat. The accurate localization of the Hg and the development of the markers flanked it should facilitate the cloning of this gene and further the study of its possible physiological function in bread wheat.

AB Gene PmAF7DS confers resistance to wheat powdery mildew (isolate Bgt#211 ); it was mapped to a 14.6-cM interval ( Xgwm350 a- Xbarc184 ) on chromosome 7DS. The flanking markers could be applied in MAS breeding.
   Wheat powdery mildew (Pm) is caused by the biotrophic pathogen Blumeria graminis tritici (DC.) (Bgt). An ongoing threat of breakdown of race-specific resistance to Pm requires a continuous effort to discover new alleles in the wheat gene pool. Developing new cultivars with improved disease resistance is an economically and environmentally safe approach to reduce yield losses. To identify and characterize genes for resistance against Pm in bread wheat we used the (Arina x Forno) RILs population. Initially, the two parental lines were screened with a collection of 61 isolates of Bgt from Israel. Three Pm isolates Bgt#210 , Bgt#211 and Bgt#213 showed differential reactions in the parents: Arina was resistant (IT = 0), whereas Forno was moderately susceptible (IT = -3). Isolate Bgt#211 was then used to inoculate the RIL population. The segregation pattern of plant reactions among the RILs indicates that a single dominant gene controls the conferred resistance. A genetic map of the region containing this gene was assembled with DNA markers and assigned to the 7D physical bin map. The gene, temporarily designated PmAF7DS, was located in the distal region of chromosome arm 7DS. The RILs were also inoculated with Bgt#210 and Bgt#213. The plant reactions to these isolates showed high identity with the reaction to Bgt#211, indicating the involvement of the same gene or closely linked, but distinct single genes. The genomic location of PmAF7DS, in light of other Pm genes on 7DS is discussed.

AB Stem rust is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. Widely virulent races of the pathogen in the Ug99 lineage (e.g., TTKSK) are threatening wheat production worldwide; therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance the diversity of resistance genes in the crop. The objectives of this study were to identify new sources of resistance in wheat-alien introgression derivatives from Secale cereale, Leymus mollis, L. racemosus, and Thinopyrum junceiforme, postulate genes conferring the resistance, and verify the postulated genes by use of molecular markers. From seedling tests conducted in the greenhouse, the presence of seven known stem rust resistance genes (Sr7b, Sr8a, Sr9d, Sr10, Sr31, Sr36, and SrSatu) was postulated in the wheat-alien introgression lines. More lines possessed a high level of resistance in the field compared with the number of lines that were resistant at the seedling stage. Three 2R (2D) wheat-rye substitution lines (SLU210, SLU238, and SLU239) seemed likely to possess new genes for resistance to stem rust based on their resistance pattern to 13 different stem rust races but the genes responsible could not be identified. Wheat-rye, wheat-L. racemosus, and wheat-L. mollis substitutions or translocations with single and multiple interchanges of chromosomes, in particular of the B and D chromosomes of wheat, were verified by a combination of genomic in situ hybridization and molecular markers. Thus, the present study identified novel resistance genes originating from different alien introgressions into the wheat genome of the evaluated lines. Such genes may prove useful in enhancing the diversity of stem rust resistance in wheat against widely virulent pathogen races such as those in the Ug99 lineage.

AB Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (P. striiformis f. tritici) affect wheat production worldwide. Brazilian 'Toropi' wheat has demonstrated durable leaf rust resistance in South America since its release in 1965. It was previously found to have up to two adult plant leaf rust resistance genes. The leaf and stripe rust resistance of Toropi were studied by analyzing a doubled-haploid population made by crossing with susceptible 'Thatcher'. Toropi expressed good resistance to leaf rust in Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand. Based on field and greenhouse testing, the leaf rust resistance of Toropi is conferred by two race-nonspecific complementary adult plant genes and a race-specific adult plant gene. The stripe rust resistance of Toropi analyzed in New Zealand and in Canada is based on up to two resistance genes. Toropi should provide an important contribution to rust resistance because it expressed good leaf rust and stripe rust resistance in different parts of the world.

AB Eighty-eight Australian and 10 international barley cultivars were assessed for resistance to the barley stripe (yellow) rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh). All cultivars were tested for seedling resistance to two UK-derived isolates of Psh (11.01 and 83.39) that were shown to differ in virulence based on responses on 16 differential barley genotypes. The 98 barley cultivars differed substantially in stripe rust response; 45% were susceptible to Psh 11.01, 53% to Psh 83.39 and 44% to both isolates. The observed diverse infection types (ITs) suggest the presence of both known and uncharacterized resistance. However, further multipathotype tests are required for accurate gene postulation. The YerongxFranklin (YxF) doubled haploid (DH) population was phenotypically assessed as seedlings using both Psh isolates. Yerong and Franklin were immune and highly resistant, respectively, to both isolates used in this study. Marker-trait and QTL mapping identified a major effect on the long arm of chromosome 7H contributed by Franklin in response to all isolates. The resistance of Yerong was mapped to 11396 and 16938 cM on chromosome 5HL in response to Psh 11.01 and 83.39, respectively. The Psh resistance sources identified in this study can be used for further genetic analysis and introgression for varietal improvement.

AB Background
   Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum not only causes severe losses in yield, but also reduces quality of wheat grain by accumulating mycotoxins. Breeding for host plant resistance is considered as the best strategy to manage FHB. Resistance in wheat to FHB is quantitative in nature, involving cumulative effects of many genes governing resistance. The poor understanding of genetics and lack of precise phenotyping has hindered the development of FHB resistant cultivars. Though more than 100 QTLs imparting FHB resistance have been reported, none discovered the specific genes localized within the QTL region, nor the underlying mechanisms of resistance.
   Findings
   In our study recombinant inbred lines (RILs) carrying resistant (R-RIL) and susceptible (SRIL) alleles of QTL-Fhb2 were subjected to metabolome and transcriptome profiling to discover the candidate genes. Metabolome profiling detected a higher abundance of metabolites belonging to phenylpropanoid, lignin, glycerophospholipid, flavonoid, fatty acid, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways in R-RIL than in S-RIL. Transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of several receptor kinases, transcription factors, signaling, mycotoxin detoxification and resistance related genes. The dissection of QTL-Fhb2 using flanking marker sequences, integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets, identified 4-Coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), callose synthase (CS), basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH041) transcription factor, glutathione S-transferase (GST), ABC transporter-4 (ABC4) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) as putative resistance genes localized within the QTL-Fhb2 region.
   Conclusion
   Some of the identified genes within the QTL region are associated with structural resistance through cell wall reinforcement, reducing the spread of pathogen through rachis within a spike and few other genes that detoxify DON, the virulence factor, thus eventually reducing disease severity. In conclusion, we report that the wheat resistance QTL-Fhb2 is associated with high rachis resistance through additive resistance effects of genes, based on cell wall enforcement and detoxification of DON. Following further functional characterization and validation, these resistance genes can be used to replace the genes in susceptible commercial cultivars, if nonfunctional, based on genome editing to improve FHB resistance.

AB Evolution of virulence in plant pathogens is still poorly understood but the knowledge is important for the effective use of plant resistance and sustainable disease management. Spatial population dynamics of virulence, race and SSR markers in 140 genotypes sampled from seven geographic locations in China were compared to infer the mechanisms driving the evolution of virulence in Phytophthora infestans (P. infestans). All virulence types and a full spectrum of race complexity, ranging from the race able to infect the universally susceptible cultivar only to all differentials, were detected. Eight and two virulence factors were under diversifying and constraining selection respectively while no natural selection was detected in one of the virulence types. Further analyses revealed excesses in simple and complex races but deficiency in intermediate race and negative associations of annual mean temperature at the site from which pathogen isolates were collected with frequency of virulence to differentials and race complexity in the pathogen populations. These results suggest that host selection may interact with other factors such as climatic conditions in determining the evolutionary trajectory of virulence and race structure in P. infestans and global warming may slow down the emergence of new virulence in the pathogen.

AB In a number of crop species hybrids are able to outperform line varieties. The anthers of the autogamous bread wheat plant are normally extruded post anthesis, a trait which is unfavourable for the production of F1 hybrid grain. Higher anther extrusion (AE) promotes cross fertilization for more efficient hybrid seed production. Therefore, this study aimed at the genetic dissection of AE by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and determination of the main effect QTL. We applied GWAS approach to identify DArT markers potentially linked to AE to unfold its genetic basis in a panel of spring wheat accessions. Phenotypic data were collected for three years and best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) values were calculated across all years. The extent of the AE correlation between growing years and BLUE values ranged from r = +0.56 (2013 vs 2015) to 0.91 (2014 vs BLUE values). The broad sense heritability was 0.84 across all years. Six accessions displayed stable AE >80% across all the years. Genotyping data included 2,575 DArT markers (with minimum of 0.05 minor allele frequency applied). AE was influenced both by genotype and by the growing environment. In all, 131 significant marker trait associations (MTAs) (vertical bar log(10) (P)vertical bar >FDR) were established for AE. AE behaved as a quantitative trait, with five consistently significant markers (significant across at least two years with a significant BLUE value) contributing a minor to modest proportion (4.29% to 8.61%) of the phenotypic variance and affecting the trait either positively or negatively. For this reason, there is potential for breeding for improved AE by gene pyramiding. The consistently significant markers linked to AE could be helpful for marker assisted selection to transfer AE to high yielding varieties allowing to promote the exploitation of hybrid-heterosis in the key crop wheat.

AB Background: Magnaporthe oryzae (anamorph Pyricularia oryzae) is the causal agent of blast disease of Poaceae crops and their wild relatives. To understand the genetic mechanisms that drive host specialization of M. oryzae, we carried out whole genome resequencing of four M. oryzae isolates from rice (Oryza sativa), one from foxtail millet (Setaria italica), three from wild foxtail millet S. viridis, and one isolate each from finger millet (Eleusine coracana), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and oat (Avena sativa), in addition to an isolate of a sister species M. grisea, that infects the wild grass Digitaria sanguinalis.
   Results: Whole genome sequence comparison confirmed that M. oryzae Oryza and Setaria isolates form a monophyletic and close to another monophyletic group consisting of isolates from Triticum and Avena. This supports previous phylogenetic analysis based on a small number of genes and molecular markers. When comparing the host specific subgroups, 1.2-3.5 % of genes showed presence/absence polymorphisms and 0-6.5 % showed an excess of non-synonymous substitutions. Most of these genes encoded proteins whose functional domains are present in multiple copies in each genome. Therefore, the deleterious effects of these mutations could potentially be compensated by functional redundancy. Unlike the accumulation of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions, gene loss appeared to be independent of divergence time. Interestingly, the loss and gain of genes in pathogens from the Oryza and Setaria infecting lineages occurred more frequently when compared to those infecting Triticum and Avena even though the genetic distance between Oryza and Setaria lineages was smaller than that between Triticum and Avena lineages. In addition, genes showing gain/loss and nucleotide polymorphisms are linked to transposable elements highlighting the relationship between genome position and gene evolution in this pathogen species.
   Conclusion: Our comparative genomics analyses of host-specific M. oryzae isolates revealed gain and loss of genes as a major evolutionary mechanism driving specialization to Oryza and Setaria. Transposable elements appear to facilitate gene evolution possibly by enhancing chromosomal rearrangements and other forms of genetic variation.

AB Barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs) are responsible for the disease barley yellow dwarf (BYD) and affect many cereals including oat (Avena sativa L.). Until recently, the molecular marker technology in oat has not allowed for many marker-trait association studies to determine the genetic mechanisms for tolerance. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on 428 spring oat lines using a recently developed high-density oat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array as well as a SNP-based consensus map. Marker-trait associations were performed using a Q-K mixed model approach to control for population structure and relatedness. Six significant SNP-trait associations representing two QTL were found on chromosomes 3C (Mrg17) and 18D (Mrg04). This is the first report of BYDV tolerance QTL on chromosome 3C (Mrg17) and 18D (Mrg04). Haplotypes using the two QTL were evaluated and distinct classes for tolerance were identified based on the number of favorable alleles. A large number of lines carrying both favorable alleles were observed in the panel.

AB Mustard aphid, also known as turnip aphid (Lipaphis erysimi) is a major insect pest of rapeseed-mustard group of crops. Tremendous economic significance has led to substantial basic research involving gene-expression studies in this insect species. In qRT-PCR analysis of gene-expression, normalization of data against RNA variation by using appropriate reference gene is fundamental. However, appropriate reference genes are not known in case of L. erysimi. We evaluated 11 candidate reference genes for their expression stability in 21 samples of L. erysimi subjected to various regimes of experimental treatments. Unlike other studies, we validated true effects of the treatments on the samples either by gene-expression study of an associated marker gene or by biochemical tests. In the validated samples, expression stability of the reference genes was analysed by employing four different statistical softwares geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and deltaCt. Drawing consensus on the results from different softwares, we recommend three best reference genes 16S, RPS18 and RPL13 for normalization of qRT-PCR data in L. erysimi. This study provides for the first time a comprehensive list of suitable reference genes for mustard aphid and demonstrates the advantage of using more than one reference gene in combination for certain experimental conditions.

   DETAILS
AB Background: Plant cell wall (PCW) polysaccharides and especially xylans constitute an important part of human diet. Xylans are not degraded by human digestive enzymes in the upper digestive tract and therefore reach the colon where they are subjected to extensive degradation by some members of the symbiotic microbiota.
   Xylanolytic bacteria are the first degraders of these complex polysaccharides and they release breakdown products that can have beneficial effects on human health. In order to understand better how these bacteria metabolize xylans in the colon, this study was undertaken to investigate xylan breakdown by the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A(T).
   Results: Transcriptomic analyses of B. xylanisolvens XB1A(T) grown on insoluble oat-spelt xylan (OSX) at mid- and late-log phases highlighted genes in a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL), hereafter called PUL 43, and genes in a fragmentary remnant of another PUL, hereafter referred to as rPUL 70, which were highly overexpressed on OSX relative to glucose. Proteomic analyses supported the up-regulation of several genes belonging to PUL 43 and showed the important over-production of a CBM4-containing GH10 endo-xylanase. We also show that PUL 43 is organized in two operons and that the knockout of the PUL 43 sensor/regulator HTCS gene blocked the growth of the mutant on insoluble OSX and soluble wheat arabinoxylan (WAX). The mutation not only repressed gene expression in the PUL 43 operons but also repressed gene expression in rPUL 70.
   Conclusion: This study shows that xylan degradation by B. xylanisolvens XB1A(T) is orchestrated by one PUL and one PUL remnant that are linked at the transcriptional level. Coupled to studies on other xylanolytic Bacteroides species, our data emphasize the importance of one peculiar CBM4-containing GH10 endo-xylanase in xylan breakdown and that this modular enzyme may be used as a functional marker of xylan degradation in the human gut. Our results also suggest that B. xylanisolvens XB1A(T) has specialized in the degradation of xylans of low complexity. This functional feature may provide a niche to all xylanolytic bacteria harboring similar PULs. Further functional and ecological studies on fibrolytic Bacteroides species are needed to better understand their role in dietary fiber degradation and their impact on intestinal health.

AB Grain protein concentration (GPC) influences end-use quality of products made from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and is therefore a high priority for breeders. Most variation in GPC is due to environmental rather than genetic effects. Because of the negative correlation between yield and GPC, enhancing genetic expression is important for improving GPC in hard wheat varieties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the Gpc-B1 allele in hard winter wheat cultivars. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) with and without the Gpc-B1 allele were created in four populations: 'Farnum' hard red winter wheat (HRW) x 'Lassik' hard red spring wheat (HRS), WA8061 (HRW; advanced breeding line) x Lassik, Farnum x 'Hollis' HRS, and Farnum by 'Eddy' HRW. Presence of this allele was validated using diagnostic marker Xuhw89. Results from field trials planted in Pullman and Lind, WA, indicate that inclusion of the Gpc-B1 allele in HRW increases GPC. A negative correlation with grain yield and GPC was found, showing inclusion of the Gpc-B1 allele significantly decreased grain yield potential. An exception was the Farnum x Hollis NIL with the Gpc-B1 allele that showed higher GPC and grain yield potential than the NIL without this allele. End-use quality of lines was also affected with the inclusion of the Gpc-B1 allele, with average decreases in milling characteristics and increases in certain baking properties. These data demonstrate that in winter wheat breeding populations, lines can be selected with the Gpc-B1 allele, resulting in increased GPC and acceptable grain yield and end-use quality profiles.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) affects wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and end-use product quality leading to massive economic losses. Red wheat cultivars are typically more resistant to PHS than white wheat. The objective of this study was to identify red wheat genotypes capable of donating genes for PHS tolerance to white wheat, independent of red seed coat color. A factorial (M x N) mating was conducted using six white wheat genotypes 'Cayuga', 'Nuplains', NW97S218, NW99L7068, 'Peck', and 'RioBlanco' and eight hard red wheat genotypes 'Arapahoe', CO960293-2, 'Jagalene', NE98466, NI01812, 'Wesley', 'Niobrara', and 'Plainsman V'. General combining ability (GCA) for individual parents and specific combining ability (SCA) for specific crosses were used to identify effective red wheat donors. General combining ability and SCA were calculated from a pre-harvest tolerance score (Lambda) determined after testing heads in a misting chamber and from falling number measurements of field-grown materials. General combining ability among red parents was significant for both Delta and falling number, but not in white parents. General combining ability or SCA by environmental interactions, with the exception of. from GCA in red wheat, were significant. Jagalene and Niobrara were identified as red wheat genetic reservoirs for additional genes of PHS tolerance useful in white wheat breeding. A significant correlation of SCA of falling number and SCA of Delta was detected (r = 0. 38, n = 48, P = 0.007). The falling number assay can be replaced by an assay for Delta to evaluate PHS tolerance in wheat breeding programs in areas in which pre-harvest sprouting is not routinely observed.

AB Gossypium arboreum L, which produces spinnable cotton fibers, is an A-genome diploid progenitor species of tetraploid cotton. With its diploid genome, publicly available genome sequence, adapted growth, and developmental and agronomic attributes, G. arboreum could make an ideal cotton species to study the genetic basis of biological traits that are controlled by orthologous loci in diploid and polyploid species. Leaf shape is an important agronomic trait in cotton. Normal, subokra, okra, and laciniate are the predominant leaf shapes in cotton cultivars. Laciniate in diploids is phenotypically similar to okra leaf shape in tetraploid. In the present study, a population of 135 F-2 plants derived from accessions NC 501 and NC 505 was used for genetic and molecular mapping of laciniate leaf shape in diploid cotton (G. arboreum). An inheritance study showed that laciniate leaf shape was controlled by a single incompletely dominant gene (LL-A(2)). Molecular genetic mapping using simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers placed the leaf shape locus L-A(2) on chromosome 2. Targeted mapping using putative genes from the delineated region established that laciniate leaf shape in G. arboreum and okra leaf shape in Gossypium hirsutum L. were controlled by genes at orthologous loci. Collinearity was well conserved between the diploid A-(G. arboreum) and D-(G. raimondii Ulbr.) genomes in the targeted genomic region narrowing the candidate region for the leaf shape locus (L-A(2)) to nine putative genes. Establishing the orthologous genomic region for the L loci could help use the diploid cotton resources toward map-based cloning of leaf shape genes in Gossypium.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most damaging wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) diseases in humid and semihumid regions around the world. Breeding efforts have focused on resistance mechanisms that limit the spread once a spike is infected-type II resistance. But resistance to initial infection, type I resistance, is an important trait that could be combined with other modes of resistance. The objective of this project was to identify and map the locations of previously unknown quantitative trait loci (QTL) that reduce the incidence of initial infection. A mapping population of 198 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was evaluated for type I resistance in both the field and greenhouse. A two-enzyme genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach was applied to construct a 1883-cM linkage map yielding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Composite interval mapping analysis detected a QTL on chromosome 1AS under greenhouse conditions and three other QTL on chromosomes 1BL, 2BL, and 3AS in field environments. Each QTL explained between 7.44 and 12.20% of the total phenotypic variation. Sixteen RILs were identified with markers for all three QTL on chromosomes 1BL, 2BL, and 3AS exhibiting significantly improved type I resistance (a mean of 33.06% improvement) over RILs with none of the three markers in field experiments. Our results also confirmed that types I and II FHB resistance were controlled by different loci in the wheat RIL population and could be used in combination to provide multiple layers of defense for cultivar development through marker-assisted selection.

AB Powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum spp.) caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (DC) E.O. Speer Em. Marchal is one of the most important bread wheat diseases in Egypt. All the Egyptian common bread wheat cultivars are susceptible to that disease at seedling and adult stages. Breeding of resistant cultivars is the most economical and environmentally safe method to eliminate the disease and reduce crop losses. Combinations of two or more effective resistance genes may lead to better, more durable resistance to that disease. Eight Pm genes i.e. Pm2, Pm6, Pm12, Pm16, Pm24, Pm35, Pm36 and Pm37 out of 21 powdery mildew monogenic wheat lines (Pm) were resistant to 42 individual isolates of powdery mildew collected from different governorates in the Nile Delta area, Egypt, at seedling and adult stages. Only four DNA specific SSR markers (Xgwm337, Xcfd7 linked to Pm24, Pm35 and Xgwm332, Xwmc790) linked to Pm37 resistance genes were selected to detect these genes in 13 Egyptian common bread wheat cultivars. This study reveals the absence of Pm24, Pm35 and Pm37 in all the 13 Egyptian bread wheat cultivars. These results gave evidence that the Egyptian cultivars are not having resistance genes and need to further incorporate one, two or more resistant genes in a single genotype as all commercial cultivars defeated by the pathogen.

AB Using a combination of de novo transcriptome assembly, a newly developed 9495-marker transcriptome SNP genetic linkage map and comparative genomics approaches, we developed an ordered set of nonredundant transcripts for each of the subgenomes of hexaploid wheat: A (47160 unigenes), B (59663 unigenes) and D (40588 unigenes). We used these as reference sequences against which to map Illumina mRNA-Seq reads derived from young leaf tissue. Transcript abundance was quantified for each unigene. Using a three-way reciprocal BLAST approach, 15527 triplet sets of homoeologues (one from each genome) were identified. Differential expression (P<0.05) was identified for 5248 unigenes, with 2906 represented at greater abundance than their two homoeologues and 2342 represented at lower abundance than their two homoeologues. Analysis of gene ontology terms revealed no biases between homoeologues. There was no evidence of genomewide dominance effects, rather the more highly transcribed individual genes were distributed throughout all three genomes. Transcriptome display tile plot, a visualization approach based on CMYK colour space, was developed and used to assess the genome for regions of skewed homoeologue transcript abundance. Extensive striation was revealed, indicative of many small regions of genome dominance (transcripts of homoeologues from one genome more abundant than the others) and many larger regions of genome repression (transcripts of homoeologues from one genome less abundant than the others).

AB Grain hardness of wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important characteristics for end-use properties. Grain texture is controlled by major locus Puroindoline gene. A large deletion of the majority of Puroindoline a (Pina) coding region cause hard texture. In this study, we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction to identify Pina-D1b allele, which is popular genotype for hard type of bread wheat in Japan. In the LAMP method, Pina-D1b allele was easily detected using the simple NaOH extraction method and visualization of DNA amplification by hydroxynaphthol blue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The locus Lr34/Yr18 plays an important role in conferring resistance to a number of fungal diseases and is thus an important component of global wheat breeding efforts. We investigated the differences in disease response and agronomic traits of the 'CDC Teal' x 'CDC Go' spring wheat population of 187 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in relation to the presence/absence of the rust resistance gene Lr34/Yr18. Lines carrying the resistant allele of Lr34/Yr18 were taller, matured earlier, and yielded less grain with lower test weights than lines without Lr34/Yr18. Lines with or without the resistant allele of Lr34/Yr18 did not differ for grain protein content, SDS sedimentation volume, and for resistance to leaf spotting and common bunt. Lines with Lr34/Yr18 exhibited lower leaf and stripe rust infection than lines without it. We selected superior lines from the population based on high yield, protein content, SDS sedimentation, and the presence of the resistant allele of Lr34/Yr18 and grew them with continued selection in replicated yield trials over nine site-years. We attempted to combine Lr34/Yr18 with high yield, protein content, and SDS sedimentation suitable for the Canadian western red spring wheat class. Our results suggested that the population size we used was not large enough to obtain recombinants with high yield potential, high grain protein, and acceptable quality attributes. Moreover, selection for Lr34/Yr18 resulted in the elimination of lines with high yield potential. We therefore suggest using a population size of at least 310 to increase the potential of pooling Lr34/Yr18 with high grain yield and desirable agronomic and end-use quality attributes.

AB Lentil populations were developed from crosses between 'JL-3' (sensitive to drought stress) and 'PDL-1' and 'FLIP-96-51' (tolerant to drought stress), to study the inheritance of drought tolerance and to identify the markers associated with it. The parental types, F-1, F-2, F-3, and backcross (BC) generations were screened for drought tolerance using seedling survivability and drought scores. The F-1 hybrids responded similar to the drought-tolerant parent, indicating dominance of seedling drought tolerance over sensitivity. Segregation for seedling survival drought tolerance versus sensitivity in F-2 generation was in complete agreement with monogenic 3:1 ratio. The F-3 families and backcross data additionally confirmed monogenic tolerance based on seedling survival under drought. Out of 51 SSR markers screened, thirteen markers were polymorphic between the parental types. Seven markers among them were found to be associated with seedling survival drought tolerance through bulk segregant analysis. Association of these markers with seedling survival drought tolerance was further confirmed through their screening on 10 drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive genotypes. These seven markers were screened in F-2 mapping population (JL-3 x PDL-1) of 101 individuals to map their position in relation to the gene for seedling survival drought tolerance. Linkage analysis mapped the seven markers within a map distance of 133.2 cM. A single major gene Sdt was identified with a LOD value of 19.9 and phenotypic variation (R-2) of 69.7 %. The Sdt locus was obtained in the marker interval of PLC_105-PBA_LC_1480 spanning 24.9 cM with the closest marker PLC_105 at a distance of 9.0 cM on the obtained linkage group. This is the first report on genetic control and linkage of SSR markers for drought tolerance in lentil. These linked markers can be used in molecular breeding programmes for introgression of seedling survival drought tolerance gene in high-yielding cultivars.

AB Crop wild relatives are considered as important genetic resources of allelic diversity for domesticated crop species. Their utilization in breeding programs, however, is often limited due to crossing barriers and genome incompatibilities. Wild relatives of barley possess attractive properties and hence allelic diversity for adapting barley better to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, gaining a better knowledge about genomic synteny between cultivated barley and wild relatives of the same genus is an important task. To visualize genomic collinearity in related species, 22 genomic single-copy and 14 complementary DNA (cDNA) chromosome 3H-specific probes were mapped to the chromosomes of Hordeum bulbosum, Hordeum marinum, Hordeum pubiflorum, Hordeum murinum, and Secale cereale by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Most probes showed reliable signals confirming homoeology between cultivated barley and related species. Differences in order and position of FISH markers demonstrated sequence movements or small-scale chromosomal rearrangements within genus Hordeum and confirmed interchromosomal rearrangements between barley and rye. Comparison between repeat-free genomic and cDNA probes showed that gene-containing single-copy genomic DNA (gDNA) probes are performing more reliably for FISH-based analysis of synteny.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a powerful molecular marker technique that has been widely used in population genetics and molecular mapping studies for various organisms. However, the technique has not been used for studying Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the wheat stripe rust pathogen. In this study, we developed over a hundred secreted protein gene-derived SNP (SP-SNP) markers and used 92 markers to study the population structure of Pst. From 352 isolates collected in the United States, we identified 242 multi-locus genotypes. The SP-SNP genotypes had a moderate, but significant correlation with the virulence phenotype data. Clustering of the multi-locus genotypes was consistent by various analyses, revealing distinct genetic groups. Analysis of molecular variance detected significant differences between the eastern and western US Pst populations. High heterozygosity was found in the US population with significant differences identified among epidemiological regions. Analysis of population differentiation revealed that populations between the eastern and western US were highly differentiated while moderate differentiation was found in populations within the western or eastern US. Isolates from the western US were more diverse than isolates from the eastern US. The information is useful for guiding the disease management in different epidemiological regions.

AB Although it is well known that low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) from wheat affect bread and noodle processing quality, the function of specific LMW-GS proteins remains unclear. It is important to find the genes that correspond to individual LMW-GS proteins in order to understand the functions of specific proteins. The objective of this study was to link LMW-GS genes and haplotypes characterized using well known Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 gene-specific primers to their protein products in a single wheat variety. A total of 36 LMW-GS genes and pseudogenes were amplified from the Korean cultivar Keumkang. These include 11 Glu-3 gene haplotypes, two from the Glu-A3 locus, two from the Glu-B3 locus, and seven from the Glu-D3 locus. To establish relationships between gene haplotypes and their protein products, a glutenin protein fraction was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and 17 protein spots were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). LMW-GS proteins were identified that corresponded to all Glu-3 gene haplotypes except the pseudogenes. This is the first report of the comprehensive characterization of LMW-GS genes and their corresponding proteins in a single wheat cultivar. Our approach will be useful to understand the contributions of individual LMW-GS to the end-use quality of flour.

AB Genome-wide association studies can identify novel genomic regions and genes that affect quantitative traits. Fusarium head blight is a destructive disease caused by Fusarium graminearum that exhibits several quantitative traits, including aggressiveness, mycotoxin production, and fungicide resistance. Restriction site associated DNA sequencing was performed for 220 isolates of F. graminearum. A total of 119 isolates were phenotyped for aggressiveness and deoxynivalenol (DON) production under natural field conditions across four environments. The effective concentration of propiconazole that inhibits isolate growth in vitro by 50% was calculated for 220 strains. Approximately 29,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were associated to each trait, resulting in 50, 29, and 74 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) that were significantly associated to aggressiveness, DON production, and propiconazole sensitivity, respectively. Approximately 41% of these QTNs caused nonsynonymous substitutions in predicted exons, while the remainder were synonymous substitutions or located in intergenic regions. Three QTNs associated with propiconazole sensitivity were significant after Bonferroni correction. These QTNs were located in genes not previously associated with azole sensitivity. The majority of the detected QTNs were located in genes with predicted regulatory functions, suggesting that nucleotide variation in regulatory genes plays a major role in the corresponding quantitative trait variation.

AB Bidirectional selective genotyping carried out independently for five quantitative traits within a biparental population of recombinant inbred lines of rye has revealed dramatic changes in alleles distribution in the population tails. A given allele, predominant in the lower tail, is often neutral for reversely directed selection or associates with the upper tail following divergent selection for a related trait. Such radical changes in the alleles distribution cannot be explained by differences in genotypic values within a single locus. This paper presents the theoretical model of a genetic mechanism underlying observed responses of individual loci to divergent selection. The presented model refers to the specific interactions between alleles at two loci. Its wider application in genetic analysis will open up new possibilities for testing positions of genes in the hierarchical structure of interacting loci revealed under selection pressure.

AB Oaks taxonomy has been revised over the years, demanding expeditious and cost-effective tools for DNA fingerprinting and taxonomic discrimination. We focused on the characterization of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of 22 Quercus species, belonging to four infrageneric groups, using silver nitrate staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and IGS PCR-RFLP markers (produced by the digestion of the rDNA intergenic spacer, IGS). A chromosome complement of 2n = 2x = 24 was confirmed in 21 species, and ascribed to Quercus phellos. Silver nitrate staining detected one or two nucleoli per nucleus, and two nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) per prometaphase cells. FISH performed with rDNA probes revealed two 5S and four 35S rDNA loci in nine species and confirmed their location in the remaining. Since no cytogenetic polymorphisms were detected, the IGS was studied. A single amplicon with ca. 2 kb was amplified in all oaks, and digested with six restriction enzymes, that produced a total of 125 IGS PCR-RFLP fragments with 99.2 % of polymorphism. A monomorphic HaeIII fragment with 225 bp was found. Among the infrageneric groups, 11 monomorphic bands were observed and 6 were considered group-specific. Based on the pool of molecular data different genetic analyses were performed. The UPGMA dendrogram clustered most of the oaks per infrageneric group, and was corroborated by the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). The genetic structure also matched the assumed taxonomy. Globally, IGS PCR-RFLP proved their usefulness for DNA fingerprinting, evaluation of phylogenies and genetic structure, proving to be an adequate complementary tool for rDNA based studies in genus Quercus.

AB New wheat- Secale africanum chromosome 5R (a) substitution and translocation lines were developed and identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular markers, and chromosome 5R (a) specific genes responsible for grain hardness were isolated.
   The wild species, Secale africanum Stapf. (genome (RRa)-R-a), serves as a valuable germplasm resource for increasing the diversity of cultivated rye (S. cereale L., genome RR) and providing novel genes for wheat improvement. In the current study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular markers were applied to characterize new wheat-S. africanum chromosome 5R(a) derivatives. Labeled rye genomic DNA (GISH) and the Oligo-probes pSc119.2 and pTa535 (FISH) were used to study a wheat-S. africanum amphiploid and a disomic 5R(a) (5D) substitution, and to identify a T5DL.5R(a)S translocation line and 5R(a)S and 5R(a)L isotelosome lines. Twenty-one molecular markers were mapped to chromosome 5R(a) arms which will facilitate future rapid identification of 5R(a) introgressions in wheat backgrounds. Comparative analysis of the molecular markers mapped on 5R(a) with homoeologous regions in wheat confirmed a deletion on the chromosome T5DL.5R(a)S, which suggests that the wheat-S. africanum Robertsonian translocation involving homologous group 5 may not be fully compensating. Complete coding sequences at the paralogous puroindoline-a (Pina) and grain softness protein gene (Gsp-1) loci from S. africanum were cloned and localized onto the short arm of chromosome 5R(a). The S. africanum chromosome 5R(a) substitution and translocation lines showed a reduction in the hardness index, which may be associated with the S. africanum- specific Pina and Gsp-1 gene sequences. The present study reports the production of novel wheat-S. africanum chromosome 5R(a) stripe rust resistant derivatives and new rye-specific molecular markers, which may find application in future use of wild Secale genome resources for grain quality studies and disease resistance breeding.

AB OsPGIP4 overexpression enhances resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.
   Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins are thought to play important roles in the innate immunity of rice against fungi. Here, we show that the chromosomal location of OsPGIP4 coincides with the major bacterial leaf streak resistance quantitative trait locus qBlsr5a on the short arm of chromosome 5. OsPGIP4 expression was up-regulated upon inoculation with the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola strain RS105. OsPGIP4 overexpression enhanced the resistance of the susceptible rice variety Zhonghua 11 to RS105. In contrast, repressing OsPGIP4 expression resulted in an increase in disease lesions caused by RS105 in Zhonghua 11 and in Acc8558, a qBlsr5a resistance donor. More interestingly, upon inoculation, the activated expression of pathogenesis-related genes was attenuated for those genes involved in the salicylic acid pathway, while the activated expression of jasmonic acid pathway markers was increased in the overexpression lines. Our results not only provide the first report that rice PGIP could enhance resistant against a bacterial pathogen but also indicate that OsPGIP4 is a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus for bacterial leaf streak in rice.

AB Objective Concatenation of two NdeI-XhoI gene fragments via an oligonucleotide linker on a plasmid vector with an SfiI site was performed to evaluate success rates in construction of polycistronic genes expressible in Escherichia coli.
   Results A series of plasmids with an SfiI site between the selection marker and the replication origin were constructed. The three wheat eEF1B subunit genes inserted between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-22b were transferred to the SfiI-containing plasmid with a spectinomycin-resistance gene. Then, the marker gene in the resultant plasmids was substituted with the ampicillin-resistance gene. These plasmids were used for concatenation of two different genes via a linker oligonucleotide containing a ribosome-binding site. During these operations, 42 clones were picked up out of which 41 had the intended product plasmid.
   Conclusion This method, named as the SfiNX method, is useful for trial-and-error based testing of different combinations of fusion and co-expression partners for optimization of recombinant protein production.

AB The Brassica oilseed crops went through two major breeding bottlenecks during the introgression of genes for zero erucic acid and low glucosinolate content, respectively, which may lead to reduced genetic biodiversity of the crop. This study investigates the impact of these bottlenecks on the genetic diversity within and across European and Chinese winter B. rapa cultivars. We compared eight cultivars from Europe and China, representing three different seed qualities from three different breeding periods: (I) high erucic acid, high glucosinolates (++); (2) zero erucic acid, high glucosinolates (0+); (3) zero erucic acid, low glucosonolates (00, canola quality). Diversity was estimated on 32 plants per cultivar, with 16 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers covering each of the B. rapa linkage groups. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that genetic variations within cultivars, across cultivars and across regions (Europe and China) were significant, with about 60% of the total variation within cultivars. There was a slight, but non-significant loss in genetic diversity within cultivars when comparing the three breeding periods as indicated by effective number of alleles (2.39, 2.23, and 1.99 for breeding periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively), Shannon information index (0.93, 0.90, 0.75), and expected heterozygosity (0.51, 0.49, 0.42). By cluster analysis (UPGMA dendrograrn) and principal coordinate analysis, Chinese and European cultivars were clearly divided into two distinct groups. In conclusion, quality improvement did not significantly reduce the genetic diversity of European and Chinese B. rapa cultivars.

AB This work analyzed the genetic diversity of Kobresia accessions at the molecular level, and further obtained the necessary information for breeding and germplasm evaluation. Genomic DNA of Kobresia was amplified with four E+3 and M+3 primer combinations with AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism). AFLP analysis produced 164 scorable bands, of which 154 (93.96%) were polymorphic. The mean Nei's gene diversity index (H) was 0.2430, and the Shannon's information index (1) was 0.4012, indicating the abundant genetic diversity of Kobresia. The 11 Kobresia accessions from Tibetan Plateau, China, can be classified into five groups after cluster analysis based on the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method arithmetic average) method. In general, there was abundant genetic diversity among Kobresia accessions resources, and the genetic coefficient was unrelated to their geographic latitude. Natural habitats influenced genetic differentiation of Kobresia.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can be a significant problem, causing deleterious effects on grain quality. However, the adverse impacts of PHS can be reduced by introgressing genes controlling grain dormancy into white-grained bread wheat. Screening for grain dormancy typically involves germination testing of harvest-ripe grain grown in a glasshouse or field. However, the more uniform environmental conditions provided by temperature controlled glasshouses (i.e. controlled environmental conditions-CEC) may provide significant benefits for the assessment of grain dormancy. In this study, the dormancy phenotype of grain grown under CEC incorporating an extended photoperiod, was compared with 2 years of data from field grown material. Four dormant double haploid lines (derived from SW95-50213 and AUS1408) and two locally adapted non-dormant cultivars EGA Gregory and EGA Wills were compared in three replicated experiments grown under CEC (22 +/- A 3A degrees C and 24 h photoperiod). The germination response of harvest-ripe grain was examined to assess the expression of grain dormancy. Two measures of germination, the predicted time to 50% germination (G (50)) and a weighted germination index, both clearly differentiated dormant and non-dormant lines grown under CEC. In addition, levels of grain dormancy were similar to field-grown plants. These results demonstrated that CEC with an extended photoperiod can be used for rapid and reliable characterisation of grain dormancy in fixed lines of bread wheat.

AB Grain dormancy in wheat is an important component of resistance to preharvest sprouting and hence an important trait for wheat breeders. The significant influence of environment on the dormancy phenotype makes this trait an obvious target for marker-assisted-selection. Closely related breeding lines, SUN325B and QT7475, containing a major dormancy QTL derived from AUS1408 located on chromosome 4A, but substantially different in dormancy phenotype, were compared with a non-dormant cultivar, Hartog, in a range of controlled environments. As temperature increased, dormancy at harvest-ripeness decreased particularly for QT7475. The dormancy phenotypes of reciprocal F(1) grains involving all possible combinations of Hartog, QT7475 and SUN325B were also compared in two environments with different temperatures. The results were consistent with the presence of QTL in addition to 4A in SUN325B, compared with QT7475, at least one of which was associated with the seed coat. Genetic analysis of a doubled haploid population derived from SUN325B x QT7475 identified a highly significant QTL located on chromosome 3BL, close to the expected position of the mutant allele of the red seed coat colour gene in white-grained wheat, R-B1a. When the lines in the population were grouped according to the parental alleles at marker loci flanking the 3B QTL, the dormancy phenotype frequency distribution for the SUN325B group was shifted towards greater dormancy compared with the QT7475 group. However, significant variation for dormancy phenotype remained within each group. Lines representing the extremes of the range of phenotypes within each group maintained their relative ranking across seven environments consistent with the presence of another unidentified QTL contributing to dormancy in SUN325B.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat greatly reduces the quality and economic value of grain, and PHS tolerance is one of the most important traits in wheat breeding. Two new Vp-1B alleles were identified in wheat genotypes with distinct PHS tolerance and ABA responsiveness and designated as Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc. These alleles had an insertion of 193-bp and a deletion of 83-bp in the third intron in the region of B(3) domain, respectively. Further analysis indicated that different Vp-1B alleles showed different expression and responsiveness to ABA exposure at transcriptional level, implying that they may regulate PHS tolerance. Based on these alleles, a STS marker Vp1B3 was developed and validated among a set of 89 Chinese wheat accessions. The results indicated that Vp1B3 may be useful as an efficient and reliable co-dominant marker in the evaluation of wheat germplasm for PHS tolerance and marker-assisted breeding for PHS tolerant cultivars. Moreover, analysis of a collection of 490 EU winter wheat varieties revealed not only the prevalence of Vp-1B alleles but also a new allele Vp-1Bd which does not occur in Chinese wheats.

AB A genetic linkage map of the fungal pathogen Phaeosphaeria nodorum, the causal agent of stagonospora nodorum blotch disease of wheat, was created. A total of 152 ascospore-derived progeny from a single pseudothecium, which resulted from a cross of two opposite mating type isolates, Sn37-1 and S-81-B13B, was analysed with AFLP, RAPD, ISSR, expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived microsatellite primers and sequence tagged site markers developed from specific genes. The genetic linkage map consisted of 276 molecular markers, and included markers developed from five genes [Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd), malate synthase (Mls1), mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mpd1), mating type (MAT1) and RNA polymerase II (RPB2)], which were assigned to 21 major linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the 21 major LGs was 1,932.1 centiMorgans (cM) with an average spacing of 6.88 cM between loci. The idiomorph mating type gene (MAT1) loci was placed in LG 2 and was closely linked to RAPD marker A4-680. On the other hand, 24 molecular markers and four gene loci [beta-glucosidase (bgl1), histidinol dehydrogenase (Hdh2), mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mpd2), and xylanase (Xyl 10-2)] were dispersed in 11 minor LGs. The segregation ratio of the xylanase (Xyl 10-1) locus was distorted and not mapped. This is the first genetic linkage map reported for this important foliar pathogen of wheat. In combination with the genomic sequence of P. nodorum strain SN15 (http://www.broad.mit.edu), the availability of a genetic linkage map of this organism would be an important tool to investigate quantitative trait loci (QTL) of biologically important phenotypes and for positional cloning.

AB Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats have become the markers of choice for marker-assisted selection because of their low template DNA requirement, high reproducibility. and high level of polymorphism. This study investigated a new set of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) EST-derived SSR markers designed to target gene sequences expressed during grain development, as they are more likely to be important in determining grain quality. The EST sequences (HVSMEh and HVSMEi) were derived from cDNA libraries of the elite six-rowed cultivar Morex, made from spikes harvested at 5 to 45 days after pollination. Approximately half of the 110 SSR markers derived from the ESTs were polymorphic in a panel of 8 diverse barley genotypes, with PIC values between 0.19 and 0.79. Twenty of the new markers were mapped to chromosomal locations using 2 doubled haploid populations. To demonstrate marker potential, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses were carried out with phenotypic data on wort beta-glucan content and beta-glucanase activity, two traits with a long history of genetic studies. Most of the EST-SSR markers mapped to within 10 cM of the cellulose synthase (HvCesA) and cellulose synthase-like (HvCslF) genes, which provides highly informative functional markers for tracking these genes in breeding programs. It was also observed that on any given chromosome, the QTL for P-glucan content and beta-glucanase activity were rarely coincident but tended to occur in adjacent intervals along chromosomal regions, which agreed with their independent genetic basis the adjacent localization may be important for coordination of cell wall degradation during germination and malting.

AB Selection of wheat germplasm for a range of quality traits has been a challenging exercise because of the cost of testing, the variation within testing data, and a poor understanding of the underlying genetics. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying quality traits in wheat. A doubled haploid population comprising 190 lines from Chara/WW2449 was grown in two different environments and evaluated for various quality traits. A molecular map comprising 362 markers based upon simple sequence repeat, sequence tagged microsatellite, glutenin, and DArT loci was constructed and subsequently exploited to identify QTLs using a whole-genome approach. Fifteen QTLs that were consistent in the two different environments were identified for thousand kernel mass, grain protein content, milling yield, flour protein content, flour colour, flour water absorption, dough development time, dough strength (extensograph height and resistance at 5 cm), and dough extensibility (extensograph length) using the whole genome average interval mapping approach. The amount of genetic variation explained by individual QTLs ranged from 3% to 49%. A number of QTLs associated with dough strength, dough extensibility, dough development time, and flour water absorption were located close to the glutenin Glu-B1 locus on chromosome 1B. Identification of the chromosomal location and effect of the QTLs influencing wheat quality may hasten the development of superior wheats for target markets via marker-assisted selection.

AB A high-resolution transcript linkage map of barley was created using a single doubled haploid (DH) mapping population, only 3'-end expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) and only PCR-based assays. Cultivar 'Haruna Nijo' and an ancestral wild-form accession 'H602' were used as EST donors and crossing parents of the mapping population. Of the 10 366 primer sets developed from a non-redundant set of 3'EST sequences, 7700 sets generated useful amplicons and 3975 (52%) showed polymorphisms between the mapping parents. Of these, 2890 (28% of the total) were mapped by single nucleotide polymorphisms ( 1717), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence ( 933) and INDELs ( 240). The present work involves an estimated 9% of the genes of barley. Of the mapped ESTs, 2689 (93%) are formatted in the Affymetrix Barley 1 GeneChip and full-length cDNA sequences are available for 1039 (36%). Mapped ESTs show highest similarity with sequences in the wheat gene index (93%) and moderate similarity with rice (50%). Comparison of mapped EST positions and the rice pseudomolecule indicated collinear regions between two species; these are particularly conserved for the entire barley chromosome 3H and rice chromosome 1. These mapped genes, together with a systematically developed set of genetic resources, will make it easier to directly clone genes showing simple inheritance and to determine the genetic basis of complex traits. The information will contribute to the development of a framework for the physical mapping of barley, which is necessary for genome sequencing.

Four putative polymorphic and reproducible RAPD markers; OPK06(791), OPA10(1140), OPN15(765) and OPA12(464) were identified. The markers, OPK06(791) and OPA10(1040) were associated with resistance in repulsion phase while, OPN15(765) and OPA12464 in coupling phase. Together, these markers determined a significant proportion of total phenotypic variation (25.05%). Regression analysis revealed three markers, OPK06(791), OPA10(1040) and OPN15(765) to be significantly associated with disease phenotype.

AB Genetic diversity among eight diverse fertility restorer lines of exotic and indigenous origin was studied using agronomic characters and molecular markers. Thirty eight of the 79 SSR markers used were found polymorphic yielding a total of 113 alleles with mean polymorphism information content (PIC) of 0.37 per marker. Dendrograms resulting from an UPGMA cluster analysis classified the fertility restorer lines into two main clusters with distinct sub-grouping. On the whole a very low range of genetic similarity (GS) was observed, which indicated that the fertility restorer lines used in the study are genetically diverse. There was low correspondence between the similarity matrices as obtained with morphological and molecular data. The information deduced from the study can be utilized in hybrid breeding programme as well as in producing combination of different fertility restorer genes in a single genetic background.

AB Drought tolerance is a key trait for increasing and stabilizing barley productivity in dry areas worldwide. Identification of the genes responsible for drought tolerance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance, and also facilitate the genetic improvement of barley through marker-assisted selection or gene transformation. To monitor the changes in gene expression at the transcriptional level in barley leaves during the reproductive stage under drought conditions, the 22K Affymetrix Barley 1 microarray was used to screen two drought-tolerant barley genotypes, Martin and Hordeum spontaneum 41-1 (HS41-1), and one drought-sensitive genotype Moroc9-75. Seventeen genes were expressed exclusively in the two drought-tolerant genotypes under drought stress, and their encoded proteins may play significant roles in enhancing drought tolerance through controlling stomatal closure via carbon metabolism (NADP malic enzyme, NADP-ME, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH), synthesizing the osmoprotectant glycine-betaine (C-4 sterol methyl oxidase, CSMO), generating protectants against reactive-oxygen-species scavenging (aldehyde dehydrogenase,ALDH, ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase, ADOR), and stabilizing membranes and proteins (heat-shock protein 17.8, HSP17.8, and dehydrin 3, DHN3). Moreover, 17 genes were abundantly expressed in Martin and HS41-1 compared with Moroc9-75 under both drought and control conditions. These genes were possibly constitutively expressed in drought-tolerant genotypes. Among them, seven known annotated genes might enhance drought tolerance through signalling [such as calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and membrane steroid binding protein (MSBP)], anti-senescence (G2 pea dark accumulated protein, GDA2), and detoxification (glutathione S-transferase, GST) pathways. In addition, 18 genes, including those encoding delta(l)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), protein phosphatase 2C-like protein (PP2C), and several chaperones, were differentially expressed in all genotypes under drought; thus they were more likely to be general drought-responsive genes in barley. These results could provide new insights into further understanding of drought-tolerance mechanisms in barley.

AB Expression of plant resistance to diseases varies according to the prevalent pathotypes and climatic conditions at different locations. This variability in partial resistance expression across locations must be known to elucidate the disease status of crop plants in field conditions. We report on the field assessment of partial resistance in wheat to yellow rust, studied at six locations in 37 wheat varieties along with the susceptible control 'Morocco' during the yellow rust season of 2007. The high disease severity of 'Morocco' revealed considerable disease pressure at all locations. The field resistance of these varieties varied across locations, with no variety being immune at all locations. Based on the average coefficients of infection, representing overall partial resistance expression, the tested varieties were grouped into high (27 varieties), moderate (9 varieties) and low levels of partial resistance (one variety). Stability in the expression of leaf tip necrosis, a marker of partial resistance to yellow rust, was recorded for the varieties Suleman-96 and Sindh-81. Kohsar-93, Bakhtawar-93, Saleem-2000, Fakhre-Sarhad, Tatara, Frontana and Karwan had an overall good level of partial field resistance across the locations. There was also considerable variation in the expression of partial resistance to yellow rust resistance across the locations.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. tritici, is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases in areas where cool temperatures prevail. The wheat cv. Renan, carrying the specific gene Yr17, has shown effective resistance for a long time, even though some pathotypes overcame the Yr17 gene. The objectives of this study were to locate and map genetic loci associated with adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between Renan (resistant) and Recital (susceptible). Field assays were performed for 4 years (1995, 1996, 2005, and 2006) to score disease-progress data and identify APR quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three QTLs, QYr.inra-2BS, QYr.inra-3BS, and QYr.inra-6B, with resistance alleles derived from Renan were detected in 1995 to 1996 with the 237E141 pathotype, which is avirulent against genotypes carrying Yr17. These QTLs were stable and explained a major part of the phenotypic variation seen in 2005 to 2006, when the 237E141 V17 pathotype was used. Each of these QTLs contributed approximate to 4 to 15% of the phenotypic variance and was effective at different adult plant stages. Interactions were observed between some markers of the Yr17 gene and three Renan QTLs: QYr.inra-2BS, QYr.inra-3BS, and QYr.inra-6B. Resistance based on the combination of different APR types should provide durable resistance to P. striiformis.

AB Wheat stripe rust (Puccinia striiforisf. sp. tritici) races CYR31 and CYR32, prevalent in China, are virulent to many wheat stripe rust resistance genes (Yr genes). To expand the availability of effective resistance to CYR31 and CYR32, stripe rust resistance was transferred from intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium) to common wheat (Triticum aestivum). The susceptible wheat cultivar CM107 was crossed with amphiploid TAI7047, derived from the wide cross Taiyuan768/Thinopyrum intermedium//76(64). Two wheat lines originating from the cross, YU24 and YU25, were resistant to CYR31 and CYR32. Pedigree analysis showed that the resistance to stripe rust in YU24 and YU25 originated from intermediate wheatgrass. Genetic analyses indicated that the resistance to stripe rust is controlled by a single dominant gene. Allelic tests determined that the resistance gene(s) in YU24 and YU25 are identical. The new gene has temporarily been designated as YrYU25. SSR and RAPD analyses showed that YrYU25 was introduced by cryptic translocation into common wheat.

AB Variation in ear emergence time is critical for the adaptation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to specific environments. The aim of this study was to identify genes controlling ear emergence time in elite European winter wheat germplasm. Four doubled haploid populations derived from the crosses: Avalon x Cadenza, Savannah x Rialto, Spark x Rialto, and Charger x Badger were selected which represent diversity in European winter wheat breeding programmes. Ear emergence time was recorded as the time from 1st May to heading in replicated field trials in the UK, France and Germany. Genetic maps based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers were constructed for each population. One hundred and twenty-seven significant QTL were identified in the four populations. These effects were condensed into 19 meta-QTL projected onto a consensus SSR map of wheat. These effects are located on chromosomes 1B (2 meta-QTL), 1D, 2A (2 meta-QTL), 3A, 3B (2 meta-QTL), 4B, 4D, 5A (2 meta-QTL), 5B, 6A, 6B 7A (2 meta-QTL), 7B and 7D. The identification of environmentally robust earliness per se effects will facilitate the fine tuning of ear emergence in predictive wheat breeding programmes.

AB Common bunt, caused by Tilletia caries (DC.) Tul. & C. Tul. and T. laevis J.G Kuhn, is an economically important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The resistance in the winter wheat cultivar 'Blizzard' is effective against known races of common bunt in western Canada. The incorporation of resistance from Blizzard into field-ready cultivars may be accelerated through the use of molecular markers. Using the maize pollen method, a doubled haploid population of 147 lines was developed from the F(1) of the second backcross of Blizzard (resistant) by breeding line '8405-JC3C' (susceptible). Doubled haploid lines were inoculated at seeding with race T19 or T19 and L16 and disease reaction was examined under controlled conditions in 1999 and natural conditions in 2002, and 2003. Resistant:susceptible-doubled haploid lines segregated in a 1:1 ratio for bunt reaction, indicating single major gene segregation. Microsatellite primers polymorphic on the parents were screened on the population. Initial qualitative segregation analysis indicated that the wheat microsatellite markers Xgwm374, Xbarc128 and Xgwm264, located on wheat chromosome 1BS, were significantly linked to the resistance locus. Qualitative results were confirmed with quantitative trait locus analysis. The genetic distance, calculated with JoinMap(A (R)), between the bunt resistance locus and overlapping markers Xgwm374, Xgwm264 and Xbarc128 was 3.9 cM. The three markers were validated on doubled haploid populations BW337/P9502&DAF1BB and Blizzard/P9514-AR17A3E evaluated for common bunt reaction in the growth chamber in 2007. These markers will be useful in selecting for the common bunt resistance from Blizzard and assist in identifying the resistance among potential new sources of resistance.

AB ESTs-derived markers are useful for comparative genomic analysis and can also serve as phenotype-linked functional markers. Here, we report the development of EST-derived 2RL-specific markers and the evaluation of the possibility of functional assessment of markers tagging 2RL, which carries Hessian fly resistance genes (loci). To identify transcripts specific to 2RL, unigene sequences in combination with wheat progenitor genomes were used. Total 275 contigs mapped to the long arms of homoeologous group 2 chromosomes were downloaded. To obtain a cluster corresponding to each of the wheat 275 contigs, unigene sequences of wheat, rice, barley, and rye were pooled for cross-species clusters. Out of 275 clusters examined, it was possible to design 112 cross-species primer pairs for genome-specific amplifications. Out of 112 cross-species primer pairs, 45 primer pairs (40%) produced amplicons from at least one species (three wheat progenitors or rye). Among the 45 contigs, 73% were associated with one of known functions and 82% of the contigs associated with known functions were also associated with one of the GO categories. On the basis of the oligonucleotide sequence alignment of each of 45 genome-specific amplifications, 21 amplifications (47%) were suitable for designing RR genome-specific primers, which are specific to translocated rye chromatin 2RL. Six primer pairs (13%) successfully produced amplicons in the 2BS.2RL translocation lines and not in the non-2RLs. Functional assessment of one of the 2RL-specific markers, NSFT03P2_Contig4445, was performed on Hessian fly infested NILs. Under Hessian fly infestation, significantly high expression of a gene tagged by a 2RL-specific marker (NSFT03P2_Contig4445) was observed 1 day after infestation. EST-derived 2RL-specific marker development from this study provides a basis for the development of ESTs-derived markers for detecting wheat-rye translocations. In addition, these markers could be employed in elucidating functional analysis of genes on 2RL.

TI Development and diversity of Andean-derived, gene-based microsatellites
   for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)

AB Background: Gene-based (genic) microsatellites are a useful tool for plant genetics and simple sequence repeat loci can often be found in coding regions of the genome. While EST sequencing can be used to discover genic microsatellites, direct screening of cDNA libraries for repeat motifs can save on overall sequencing costs. The objective of this research was to screen a large cDNA library from and Andean common bean genotype for six di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs through a filter hybridization approach and to develop microsatellite markers from positive clones.
   Results: Robotics were used for high-throughput colony picking and to create a high-density filter of 18,432 double spotted cDNA clones which was followed by hybridization with repeat motif containing probes based on GA, CA, AAT, CAG, CAA and ACG repeats. A total of 1203 positive clones were identified by their addresses and sequenced from 5' ends and if required from 3' ends to confirm repeat motif and length. Out of 886 high quality sequences, 497 had complete microsatellite loci that were not truncated by the sequencing reaction and of these tri-nucleotide repeats were more common than di-nucleotide repeats. Different motifs were found in different frequencies in the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNAs. In a microsatellite development program, primers were designed for 248 SSR loci which were tested on a panel of 18 common bean genotypes to determine their potential as genetic markers finding higher average polymorphism information content for di-nucleotide repeat markers (0.3544) than for tri-nucleotide repeat markers (0.1536).
   Conclusion: The present study provides a set of validated gene-based markers for common bean that are derived from G19833, an Andean landrace that is an important source of disease and abiotic stress tolerance which has been used for physical map development and as a mapping parent. Gene-based markers appear to be very efficient at separating divergent wild and cultivated accessions as well as Andean and Mesoamerican genepools and therefore will be useful for diversity analyses and for comparative and transcript mapping in common bean.

TI Identification of an extensive gene cluster among a family of PPOs in
   Trifolium pratense L. (red clover) using a large insert BAC library

AB Background: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in plants is a trait with potential economic, agricultural and environmental impact. In relation to the food industry, PPO-induced browning causes unacceptable discolouration in fruit and vegetables: from an agriculture perspective, PPO can protect plants against pathogens and environmental stress, improve ruminant growth by increasing nitrogen absorption and decreasing nitrogen loss to the environment through the animal's urine. The high PPO legume, red clover, has a significant economic and environmental role in sustaining low-input organic and conventional farms. Molecular markers for a range of important agricultural traits are being developed for red clover and improved knowledge of PPO genes and their structure will facilitate molecular breeding.
   Results: A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising 26,016 BAC clones with an average 135 Kb insert size, was constructed from Trifolium pratense L. (red clover), a diploid legume with a haploid genome size of 440-637 Mb. Library coverage of 6-8 genome equivalents ensured good representation of genes: the library was screened for polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes. Two single copy PPO genes, PPO4 and PPO5, were identified to add to a family of three, previously reported, paralogous genes (PPO1-PPO3). Multiple PPO1 copies were identified and characterised revealing a subfamily comprising three variants PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5. Six PPO genes clustered within the genome: four separate BAC clones could be assembled onto a predicted 190 510 Kb single BAC contig.
   Conclusion: A PPO gene family in red clover resides as a cluster of at least 6 genes. Three of these genes have high homology, suggesting a more recent evolutionary event. This PPO cluster covers a longer region of the genome than clusters detected in rice or previously reported in tomato. Full-length coding sequences from PPO4, PPO5, PPO1/5 and PPO1/4 will facilitate functional studies and provide genetic markers for plant breeding.

   GENETICS
AB Background: The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is an important insect pest of wheat. It has tractable genetics, polytene chromosomes, and a small genome (158 Mb). Investigation of the Hessian fly presents excellent opportunities to study plant-insect interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying genome imprinting and chromosome elimination. A physical map is needed to improve the ability to perform both positional cloning and comparative genomic analyses with the fully sequenced genomes of other dipteran species.
   Results: An FPC-based genome wide physical map of the Hessian fly was constructed and anchored to the insect's polytene chromosomes. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to 12-fold coverage of the Hessian fly genome were fingerprinted, using high information content fingerprinting (HIFC) methodology, and end-sequenced. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) co-localized two BAC clones from each of the 196 longest contigs on the polytene chromosomes. An additional 70 contigs were positioned using a single FISH probe. The 266 FISH mapped contigs were evenly distributed and covered 60% of the genome (95,668 kb). The ends of the fingerprinted BACs were then sequenced to develop the capacity to create sequenced tagged site (STS) markers on the BACs in the map. Only 3.64% of the BAC-end sequence was composed of transposable elements, helicases, ribosomal repeats, simple sequence repeats, and sequences of low complexity. A relatively large fraction (14.27%) of the BES was comprised of multi-copy gene sequences. Nearly 1% of the end sequence was composed of simple sequence repeats (SSRs).
   Conclusion: This physical map provides the foundation for high-resolution genetic mapping, map-based cloning, and assembly of complete genome sequencing data. The results indicate that restriction fragment length heterogeneity in BAC libraries used to construct physical maps lower the length and the depth of the contigs, but is not an absolute barrier to the successful application of the technology. This map will serve as a genomic resource for accelerating gene discovery, genome sequencing, and the assembly of BAC sequences. The Hessian fly BAC-clone assembly, and the names and positions of the BAC clones used in the FISH experiments are publically available at http://genome.purdue.edu/WebAGCoL/Hfly/WebFPC/.

AB Segregation at major genes controlling plant height, photoperiod response, and vernalization response in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell.) may have pleiotropic effects on several traits. Allelic variation at these loci can be monitored using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. The effect of segregation at these loci on maturity and agronomic traits was measured for sets of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) developed from five crosses between spring wheat lines adapted to Montana and the Northern Great Plains. Results from field trials grown in multiple years in Bozeman, MT, showed that variation at Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 had large effects on most agronomic traits in two populations, including grain yield, grain protein concentration, and test weight. Variation at photoperiod response loci Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1 influenced both heading date and date of flag leaf senescence under field conditions for two of three populations in which they were segregating. The insensitive allele at Ppd-B1 was associated with higher grain yield in one population. Variation at Vrn-B1 had a significant effect on heading date in the field for both populations in which it was segregating, with spring allele lines being earlier. Our results suggest that variation at Rht loci impacting plant height had large pleiotropic effects. Variation at photoperiod and vernalization loci impacted maturity characteristics but had less consistent effects on economic characteristics such as grain yield, test weight, and grain protein concentration.

AB To date, only one gene conferring resistance to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) designated as Wsm1 was transferred from Thinopyrum inter-medium (Host) Barkworth and Dewey to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the form of a compensating Robertsonian translocation T4DL.4J(s)S. Wsm1 confers high levels of resistance to WSMV under field conditions; however, in certain genetic backgrounds and environments, the presence of the T4DL.4J(s)S translocation reduces agronomic performance. The objective of this study was to shorten the Th. intermedium segment in the T4DL.4J(s)S translocation. We recovered one proximal (rec36) and four distal (rec45, rec64 rec87, rec213) primary recombinants. Genomic in situ hybridization and molecular marker analyses determined the size of the Th. intermedium segments in the distal recombinants to be about 20% of the 4DS-4J(s)S arm. All primary recombinant stocks, together with appropriate controls, were evaluated for their resistance to WSMV and Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) in greenhouse tests. Whereas the distal recombinants rec45, rec64, rec87, and rec213 were resistant to both WSMV and TriMV at low temperatures of 18 degrees C, the proximal recombinant rec36 reacted susceptible, which mapped the Wsm1 gene to the distal 20% of the 4DS-4J(s)S arm. We successfully shortened the Th. intermedium segment while still retaining the Wsm1 gene. The T4DL.4DS-4J(s)S recombinant chromosome of the rec213 stock was transferred to adapted Kansas hard red winter wheat cultivars.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [teleomorph: Gibberella zeae (Schwein.) Petch], is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), causing low yields and poor quality kernels that may be contaminated by the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). The objective of this study was to examine kernel damage resistance and to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with FHB resistance in wheat. A population of 269 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between IL94-1653 x Patton was evaluated for FHB resistance in greenhouse and field trials at Urbana, IL. The RIL population exhibited a broad and continuous distribution for all FHB resistance measurements. The correlation of disease severity with kernel damage was 0.78 in the greenhouse trial and 0.58 in the field trial. Grain DON concentration appeared to be environmentally affected, and correlated the most consistently with the ISK index, an index combining incidence, severity, and kernel damage measurements. Four severity QTL were identified on chromosomes 2B, 3B, 4B, and 6B, each explaining about 4 to 6% of the phenotypic variation. The same severity QTL were not detected in both the field and greenhouse trials. Three kernel damage QTL were identified on chromosomes 2B, 4B, and 613, with the 4B QTL explaining 7 and 12.3% of the phenotypic variation for kernel damage in the greenhouse and field trials, respectively. This is the second report of a kernel damage QTL in this region of chromosome 413, indicating that this QTL may contribute to reducing Fusarium-damaged kernels percentage.

AB The structure of the U.S. wheat powdery mildew population (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) has not been previously investigated, and the global evolutionary history of B. graminis f. sp. tritici is largely unknown. After gathering 141 single-ascosporic B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates from 10 eastern U.S. locations, 34 isolates from the United Kingdom, and 28 isolates from Israel, we analyzed pathogen population structure using presumptively neutral markers. DNA was extracted from conidia, primers for 12 "housekeeping" genes were designed, and amplicons were examined for polymorphism. Four genes were found to contain a total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the U.S. population and were also analyzed in the U.K. and Israeli populations. In total, 25 haplotypes were inferred from the four concatenated genes, with 2 haplotypes comprising over 70% of the U.S. population. Using Hudson's tests and analysis of molecular variance, we found the wheat mildew isolates subdivided into four groups corresponding to distinct regions: the mid-Atlantic United States, the southern United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel. Genotypic diversity was greatest in samples from the United Kingdom, Israel, Virginia, and Kinston, NC. Using rarefaction, a procedure that compensates for differing sample sizes when estimating population richness and diversity, we found that cooler locations with greater conduciveness to regular powdery mildew epidemics had the greatest haplotype richness. Our results suggest that the eastern U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici population is young, descended recently from Old World populations with isolation and genetic drift, and is currently subdivided into northern and southern subpopulations.

TI An Integrated Resource for Barley Linkage Map and Malting Quality QTL
   Alignment
SO PLANT GENOME
LA English
DT Article
AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an economically important model plant for genetics research. Barley is currently served by an increasingly comprehensive set of tools for genetic analysis that have recently been augmented by high-density genetic linkage maps built with gene-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNP-based maps need to be aligned with earlier generation maps, which were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection, by integrating multiple types of markers into a single map. A 2383 locus linkage map was developed using the Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) Mapping Population to allow such alignments. The map is based on 1472 SNP, 722 DArT, and 189 prior markers which include morphological, simple sequence repeat (SSR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequence tagged site (STS) loci. This new OWB map forms, therefore, a useful bridge between high-density SNP-only maps and prior QTL reports. The application of this bridge concept is shown using malting-quality QTLs from multiple mapping populations, as reported in the literature. This is the first step toward developing a Barley QTL Community Curation workbook for all types of QTLs and maps, on the GrainGenes website. The OWB-related resources are available at OWB Data and GrainGenes Tools (OWB-DGGT) (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/maps/OWB/).

TI Single-Feature Polymorphism Mapping in Bread Wheat
SO PLANT GENOME
LA English
DT Article
AB Probe hybridization data from the Affymetrix GeneChip platform can be used to identify genetic polymorphisms. Developed from gene expression data, these single-feature polymorphism (SFP) markers are located in or are tightly associated with gene sequences. Using two different methods to identify SFPs, 1035 and 875 SFPs were mapped in a segregating population of 64 doubled haploid lines from the Triticum aestivum L. cross RL4452 x 'AC Domain'. Statistical associations between the SFP maps and the rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) genome were in agreement with known cereal syntenic blocks, and the mapping data were corroborated by previously established physical locations for wheat expressed sequence tags. This approach allowed the rapid identification of markers from the genic regions of the complex hexaploid wheat genome.

AB The phenomenon of maternal haploid induction in maize was first described many years ago, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the Stock-6-derived, haploid-inducing line CAUHOI with high kernel oil content (KOC), was used as the pollinator to produce maternal haploids from the maize hybrid ZD958 with low KOC. CAUHOI is homozygous for the dominant marker gene R1-nj. Haploids were identified by morphological and cytological investigations. The frequency of haploid induction from this cross was 2.21%. Unexpectedly, many haploid kernels had weakly pigmented purple color on the embryo, and some haploid kernels had high KOC. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis showed that 43.18% of the haploids carried segments from CAUHOI, and a small proportion (average 1.84%) of the genome of CAUHOI was introgressed into haploids. Haploid kernels with high KOC had a higher frequency of segment introgression from CAUHOI (2.92%) than that in haploid kernels with low KOC (1.79%), showing that the marker gene R1-nj and high-oil genes from CAUHOI were expressed during the development of some haploid embryos, and confirmed that the DNA introgression from the inducer parent occurred during maternal haploid induction. Together, these results suggested that the chromosome elimination was probably responsible for haploid induction in maize, and late somatic elimination might occur. Several possible mechanisms underlying haploid formation are discussed.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide in areas with cool or maritime climates. Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) is an important potential donor of disease resistances and other traits for common wheat improvement. A powdery mildew resistance gene was transferred from wild emmer accession G-303-1M to susceptible common wheat by crossing and backcrossing, resulting in inbred line P63 (Yanda1817/G-303-1 M//3*Jing411, BC(2)F(6)). Genetic analysis of an F(2) population and the F(2:3) families developed from a cross of P63 and a susceptible common wheat line Xuezao showed that the powdery mildew resistance in P63 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis were used to characterize and map the powdery mildew resistance gene. Nine genomic SSR markers (Xbarc7, Xbarc55, Xgwm148, Xgwm257, Xwmc35, Xwmc154, Xwmc257, Xwmc382, Xwmc477), five AFLP-derived SCAR markers (XcauG3, XcauG6, XcauG10, XcauG20, XcauG22), three EST-STS markers (BQ160080, BQ160588, BF146221) and one RFLP-derived STS marker (Xcau516) were linked to the resistance gene, designated pm42, in P63. pm42 was physically mapped on chromosome 2BS bin 0.75-0.84 using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic and deletion lines, and was estimated to be more than 30 cM proximal to Xcau516, a RFLP-derived STS marker that co-segregated with the wild emmer-derived Pm26 which should be physically located in 2BS distal bin 0.84-1.00. pm42 was highly effective against 18 of 21 differential Chinese isolates of B. graminis f. sp. tritici. The closely linked molecular markers will enable the rapid transfer of pm42 to wheat breeding populations thus adding to their genetic diversity.

AB Pyramiding of genes that confer partial resistance is a method for developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with durable resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. In this research, a doubled haploid population derived from the cross between the synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) (xAegilotriticum spp.) line TA4152-60 and the North Dakota breeding line ND495 was used for identifying genes conferring partial resistance to leaf rust in both the adult plant and seedling stages. Five QTLs located on chromosome arms 3AL, 3BL, 4DL, 5BL and 6BL were associated with adult plant resistance with the latter four representing novel leaf rust resistance QTLs. Resistance effects of the 4DL QTL were contributed by ND495 and the effects of the other QTLs were contributed by the SHW line. The QTL on chromosome arm 3AL had large effects and also conferred seedling resistance to leaf rust races MJBJ, TDBG and MFPS. The other major QTL, which was on chromosome arm 3BL, conferred seedling resistance to race MFPS and was involved in a significant interaction with a locus on chromosome arm 5DS. The QTLs and the associated molecular markers identified in this research can be used to develop wheat cultivars with potentially durable leaf rust resistance.

AB We report on the verification of a resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 1BL (now designated Qfhs.lfl-1BL) which had been previously identified in the winter wheat cultivar Cansas. For a more precise estimation of the QTL effect and its influence on plant height and heading date lines with a more homogeneous genetic background were created and evaluated in four environments after spray inoculation with Fusarium culmorum. Qfhs.lfl-1BL reduced FHB severity by 42% relative to lines without the resistance allele. This QTL did not influence plant height, but significantly delayed heading date by one day. All of the most resistant genotypes of the verification population carried this major QTL displaying its importance for disease resistance. This resistance QTL has not only been found in the cultivar Cansas, but also in the three European winter wheat cultivars Biscay, History and Pirat. A subsequent meta-analysis confirmed the presence of a single QTL on the long arm of chromosome 1B originating from the four mentioned cultivars. Altogether, the results of the present study indicate that Qfhs.lfl-1BL is an important component of FHB resistance in European winter wheat and support the view that this QTL would be effective and valuable in backcross breeding programmes.

AB Threshability is an important crop domestication trait. The wild wheat progenitors have tough glumes enveloping the floret that make spikes difficult to thresh, whereas cultivated wheats have soft glumes and are free-threshing. In hexaploid wheat, the glume tenacity gene Tg along with the major domestication locus Q control threshability. The Q gene was isolated recently and found to be a member of the AP2 class of transcription factors. However, only a few studies have reported on the tough glume trait. Here, we report comparative mapping of the soft glume (sog) gene of diploid Triticum monococcum L. and tenacious glume (Tg) gene of hexaploid T. aestivum L. using chromosome-specific SSR and RFLP markers. The sog gene was flanked by Xgwm71 and Xbcd120 in a 6.8 cM interval on chromosome 2A(m)S of T. monococcum whereas Tg was targeted to a 8.1 cM interval flanked by Xwmc503 and Xfba88 on chromosome 2DS of T. aestivum. Deletion bin mapping of the flanking markers assigned sog close to the centromere on 2AS, whereas Tg was mapped to the most distal region on 2DS. Both 2AS and 2DS maps were colinear ruling out the role of chromosome rearrangements for their non-syntenic positions. Therefore, sog and Tg are not true orthologues suggesting the possibility of a diverse origin.

AB In order to clarify the transmission of the rye chromosome 1R in winter wheat germplasm Aimengniu and its derivatives, 17 derivatives and 7 types of Aimengniu were examined through molecular-marker technology. The results showed that the chromosome arm 1RS of Neuzucht was transmitted to 5 of the 7 types of Aimengniu, i.e., Aimengniu II and Aimengniu IV-Aimengniu VII, no segment of 1RS was identified in Aimengniu I or Aimengniu III. As for the 17 derivatives, the 1RS chromosome arm of Aimengniu was transmitted to 11 derivatives, part segments of 1RS were found in 1 derivative, while no segment was found in the remaining 5 ones. The results provided the evidence that molecular-marker technology was an efficient approach and suitable for analysis of the transmission of chromosome 1R.

AB Simple sequence repeat (SSR) DNA markers were used to characterize the genetic diversity in 70 accessions of Aegilops crassa from Iran as well as to determine relationships among these accessions with 9 accessions of Aegilops tauschii (subsp. tauschii and strangulata) and 5 Triticum aestivum landraces. All twenty SSR primer pairs were polymorphic and identified a total number of 149 alleles corresponding to an average of 7.5 alleles per locus. The highest and lowest PIC values were obtained in subsp. strangulata and Ae. crassa accessions, respectively. Data obtained were used to estimate genetic similarity using the Dice coefficient, and dendrogram was constructed using the UPGMA method. The dendrogram separated the 84 accessions into two main groups. All species grouped according to their genomes. A good level of genetic diversity was observed in the accessions of Ae. crassa, even in geographically close regions, which can be used in the broadening of the genetic base of bread wheat. In addition, T. aestivum and subsp. tauschii were clustered further away from Ae. crassa, confirming probably chromosomal rearrangements in the D genome of Ae. crassa during the processes of evolution.

AB Genetic improvement in aluminium tolerance is one of the most cost-effective solutions to improve the productivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in acid soils. Sources of tolerance to this abiotic stress within adapted germplasm are limited, so the identification and characterisation of new sources are of some priority for the future of plant breeding in target areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to aluminium stress of an old Portuguese wheat collection and to select the most tolerant ones for genetic and breeding purposes. An old collection of Portuguese wheat cultivars and some 'Barbela' lines were tested and classified in relation to aluminium tolerance and compared to modern wheat cultivars using a hydroponic approach. Three bread wheat cultivars ('Viloso Mole', Magueija' and 'Ruivo') showed greater tolerance to 5 ppm aluminium than the international wheat standard cultivar 'BH1146', and so represent excellent material for understanding the genetic control of aluminium tolerance. In addition, several accessions of the Portuguese landrace 'Barbela' were outstanding in terms of aluminium tolerance. In particular, line 7/72/92 had a pronounced advantage over 'BH1146' in terms of root regrowth.

AB The introgressed alien chromosome in BC(10)F(5) progeny of the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Agropyron elongatum (Host) (2n = 7X = 70) [syn. Thinopyrum ponticum (Popd.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey] was determined by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using genomic DNA from A. elongatum as a probe in GISH and repeat sequence pAs1, pSc119.2 as probes in FISH, and molecular marker techniques. The results revealed that the line was a chromosome additional line in which a pair of the chromosomes added was composed of chromosome segment from E-genome of A. elongatum and short arm of 5B of common wheat cultivar Gao 38 identified by E-genome-specific primers. Powdery mildew test showed the line was highly resistant to powdery mildew as its A. elongatum parent and this indicated that the gene of resistant to powdery mildew might come from A. elongatum and localized on E-genome.

AB Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), highly dispersed nucleotide sequences in genomes, were used for germplasm analysis and estimation of the genetic relationship of the D-genome among 52 accessions of T. aestivum (AABBDD), Ae. tauschii (D(t)D(t)), Ae. cylindrica (CCD(c)D(c)) and Ae. crassa (MMD(cr1)D(cr1)), collected from 13 different sites in Iran. A set of 21 microsatellite primers, from various locations on the seven D-genome chromosomes, revealed a high level of polymorphism. A total of 273 alleles were detected across all four species and the number of alleles per each microsatellite marker varied from 3 to 27. The highest genetic diversity occurred in Ae. tauschii followed by Ae. crassa, and the genetic distance was the smallest between Ae. tauschii and Ae. cylindrica. Data obtained in this study supports the view that genetic variability in the D-genome of hexaploid wheat is less than in Ae. tauschii. The highest number of unique alleles was observed within Ae. crassa accessions, indicating this species as a great potential source of novel genes for bread wheat improvement. Knowledge of genetic diversity in Aegilops species provides different levels of information which is important in the management of germplasm resources.

AB Resistance to both barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) and cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV) has been demonstrated in wheat genetic stocks with Thinopyrum intermedium chromatin. A number of resistance-bearing translocations have been reported on chromosome arm 7DL from two independent Th. intermedium sources; one source is the addition line L1 and the other is the spontaneous substitution line P29. Another source of resistance in wheat cytogenetic stocks is available as a 2Ai(2D) substitution line. We used a set of 38 molecular markers and the available deletion stocks to compare the size of the 7DL translocations more comprehensively than has been done previously. We also compared the efficacy of BYDV resistance of the various genetic stocks both before and after transfer to a common genetic background. TC14 was confirmed as carrying the smallest translocation, replacing about 20% of the distal end of 7DL. TC5 and TC10 had 90% of the chromosome arm replaced by Th. intermedium chromatin; the proximal 10% corresponded to wheat chromatin. YW642 appeared to have the whole 7DL replaced by Th. intermedium chromatin, as confirmed by the co-dominant marker cfd68 mapping on the bin nearest the centromere. Translocation line P961341 had bins 3, 7, and 8 replaced by Th. intermedium chromatin, making this the second smallest translocation with BYDV and CYDV resistance. The translocation sizes reported here differ from some of the previous estimates. The translocated Th. intermedium segments appeared to be bigger than the replaced wheat 7DL fragments. All the resistances derived from the L1 and P29 group 7 chromosomes and the 2Ai#2 chromosome were effective in reducing the number of infected plants and the mean virus titre, regardless of the background. Some evidence is discussed suggesting the long arm of the Th. intermedium group 7 chromosome 7Ai#1 carries two resistances, the distal Bdv2 and a proximal second gene.

AB Disease resistance (R) genes are intriguing in their evolution and diversity patterns because of their constant interactions with evolving pathogens. In this study, we demonstrate the use of resistance gene analog (RGA) markers to estimate genetic diversity among 13 populations (118 genotypes) of Triticum dicoccoides collected along a natural aridity gradient in Israel. The diversity patterns of 204 markers derived from two R-gene domains, nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR), were compared and contrasted. Diversity patterns of NBS domain markers differed significantly from those of the LRR domain. NBS markers showed higher between-population diversity (F(st) = 0.58), while LRR markers showed higher within-population diversity (F(st) = 0.35). Gene diversity (H(e)) values were twofold higher in the LRR domain than in the NBS domain (0.144 vs. 0.067). LRR H(e) values were correlated with precipitation in the spring (r = 0.8, p = 0.01), while NBS H(e) values showed no correlation with any ecogeographical variable. The evolutionary and applicative inferences of these findings are discussed. The current study demonstrates that RGA profiling is an excellent tool for studying diversity of R genes in natural plant populations.

AB In hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (AABBDD, C = 17 000 Mb), repeat DNA accounts for similar to 90% of the genome, of which transposable elements (TEs) constitute 60%-80%. Despite the dynamic evolution of TEs, our previous study indicated that the majority of TEs are conserved and collinear between the homologous wheat genomes, based on identical insertion patterns. In this study, we exploited the unique and abundant TE insertion junction regions identified from diploid Aegilops tauschii to develop genome-specific repeat DNA junction markers (RJM) for use in hexaploid wheat. In this study, both BAC end and random shotgun sequences were used to search for RJM. Of the 300 RJM primer pairs tested, 269 (90%) amplified single bands from diploid Ae. tauschii. Of these 269 primer pairs, 260 (97%) amplified hexaploid wheat and 9 (3%) amplified Ae. tauschii only. Among the RJM primers that amplified hexaploid wheat, 88% were successfully assigned to individual chromosomes of the hexaploid D genome. Among the 38 RJM primers mapped on chromosome 6D, 31 (82%) were unambiguously mapped to delineated bins of the chromosome using various wheat deletion lines.

AB Rice is the first cereal genome with a finished sequence and a model crop that has important syntenic relationships with other cereal species. The objectives of our study were to identify resistance gene analogue (RGA) sequences from chromosome 11 of rice, understand their expression in other cereals and dicots by in silico analysis, determine their presence on other rice chromosomes, and evaluate the extent of polymorphism and actual expression in a set of rice genotypes. A total of 195 RGAs were predicted and physically localised. Of these, 91.79% expressed in rice, and 51.28% expressed in wheat, which was the highest among other cereals. Among monocots, sugarcane showed the highest (78.92%) expression, while among dicots, RGAs were maximally expressed in Arabidopsis (11.79%). Interestingly, two of the chromosome 11-specific RGAs were found to be expressing in all the organisms studied. Eighty RGAs of chromosome 11 had significant homology with chromosome 12, which was the maximum among all the rice chromosomes. Thirty-one per cent of the RGAs used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification showed polymorphism in a set of rice genotypes. Actual gene expression analysis revealed post-inoculation induction of one RGA in the rice line IRBB-4 carrying the bacterial blight resistance gene Xa-4. Our results have implications for the development of sequence-based markers and functional validation of specific RGAs in rice.

AB The avirulence characteristic of Magnaporthe grisea isolate TH16 corresponding to Jao Hom Nin (JHN) rice cultivar was studied by mapping population of 140 random ascospore progenies derived from the cross between B1-2 and TH16 isolates. Segregation analyses of the avirulence characteristic performing on JHN rice at the seedling and flowering stages were performed in this mapping population. We used the reference map of Guy11/2539 to choose microsatellite DNA markers for mapping the avirulence gene. The genetic map of this population was constructed from 39-microsatellite markers. The genetic map was spanned by covering seven chromosomes with an average distance of 11.9 cM per marker. In mapping population the distribution of pathogenic and non-pathogenic progenies on JHN rice were found to be fitted to 1 : 1 ratio for two of the rice stages, seedling and flowering stages. The Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis for avirulence genes corresponding to two rice stages were located at the same region on chromosome 2 between markers Pyms305 and Pyms435. The LOD score and percentage of phenotypic variance explained (PVE) on two rice stages were 5.01/16.69 and 6.73/20.26, respectively. These loci were designated as Avr-JHN(lb) and Avr-JHN(pb) corresponding to leaf and panicle blast characteristics. The findings of this study can be the initial step for positional cloning and identifying any function of avirulence genes corresponding to leaf and panicle blast characteristics.

AB The primary aim of this work was to evaluate potential changes in the metabolic network of transgenic wheat grain over-expressing the high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin Dx5-subunit gene. GC-MS and multivariate analyses were used to compare the metabolite profiles of developing caryopses of two independently transformed lines over-expressing Dx5 and another two independently transformed lines expressing only the selectable-marker gene (controls). Developing grain at 7, 14 and 21 Days Post-Anthesis (DPA) was studied to observe differences in metabolically active tissues. There was no distinction between the Dx5 transformants and the controls by principal component analysis (PCA) suggesting that their metabolite compositions were similar. Most changes in metabolite levels and starch occurred at 14 DPA but tapered off by 21 DPA. Only 3 metabolites, guanine, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and Unknown 071306a, were altered due to Dx5 expression after correction for false discovery rates (P < 0.0005). However, discriminant function analysis (DFA) and correlative analyses of the metabolites showed that Dx5-J, which had the highest level of Dx5 protein in ripe caryopses, could be distinguished from the other genotypes. The second aim of this work was to determine the influence of gene transformation on the metabolome. Cross-comparison of the transformed controls to each other, and to the Dx5 genotypes showed that approximately 50% of the metabolic changes in the Dx5 genotypes were potentially due to variations arising from gene transformation and not from the expression of the Dx5-gene per se. This study therefore suggests the extent to which plant transformation by biolistics can potentially influence phenotype.

AB A novel methodology is described in which transcriptomics is combined with the measurement of bread-making quality and other agronomic traits for wheat genotypes grown in different environments (wet and cool or hot and dry conditions) to identify transcripts associated with these traits. Seven doubled haploid lines from the Spark x Rialto mapping population were selected to be matched for development and known alleles affecting quality. These were grown in polytunnels with different environments applied 14 days post-anthesis, and the whole experiment was repeated over 2 years. Transcriptomics using the wheat Affymetrix chip was carried out on whole caryopsis samples at two stages during grain filling. Transcript abundance was correlated with the traits for approximately 400 transcripts. About 30 of these were selected as being of most interest, and markers were derived from them and mapped using the population. Expression was identified as being under cis control for 11 of these and under trans control for 18. These transcripts are candidates for involvement in the biological processes which underlie genotypic variation in these traits.

AB Whereas gluten fraction accounts for 30-60% of the variation in wheat bread-making quality, there remains substantial variation determined by non-gluten factors. The objective of this study was to detect new loci for wheat quality. The genetics of sodium dodecyl sulphate-sedimentation volume (Ssd), grain hardness (GH), grain protein content, wet gluten content (WGC) and water absorption (Abs) in a set of 198 recombinant inbred lines derived from two commercial varieties was studied by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. A genetic map based on 255 marker loci, consisting of 250 simple sequence repeat markers and five glutenin loci, Glu-A1, Glu-B1, Glu-D1, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3, was constructed. A total of 73 QTLs were detected for all traits. A major QTL for GH was detected on chromosome 1B and its relative contribution to phenotypic variation was 27.7%. A major QTL for Abs on chromosome 5D explained more than 30% of the phenotypic variation. Variations in Ssd were explained by four kinds of genes. Some QTLs for correlated traits mapped to the same regions forming QTL clusters or indicated pleiotropic effects.

AB Hexaploid wheat, one of the world's most important staple crops, remains a challenge for genetic transformation. We are developing a floral transformation protocol for wheat that does not require tissue culture. This paper presents three transformants in the hard red germplasm line Crocus that have been characterized thoroughly at the molecular level over three to six generations. Wheat spikes at the early boot stage, i.e. the early, mid or late uninucleate microspore stages, were immersed in an infiltration medium of strain C58C1 harboring pDs(Hyg)35S, or strain AGL1 harboring pBECKSred. pDs(Hyg)35S contains the NPTII and hph selectable markers, and transformants were detected using paromomycin spray at the whole plant level, NPTII ELISAs, or selection on medium with hygromycin. Strain AGL1, harboring pBECKSred, which contains the maize anthocyanin regulators, Lc and C1, and the NPTII gene, was also used to produce a Crocus transformant. T1 and T2 seeds with red embryos were selected; T1 and T2 plants were screened by sequential tests for paromomycin resistance and NPTII ELISAs. The transformants were low copy number and showed Mendelian segregation in the T2. Stable transmission of the transgenes over several generations has been demonstrated using Southern analysis. Gene expression in advanced progeny was shown using Reverse Transcriptase-PCR and ELISA assays for NPTII protein expression. This protocol has the potential to reduce the time and expense required for wheat transformation.

AB Although heterosis is widely used in conventional plant breeding, its genetic mechanism has not been well understood at the molecular level. In this study, we identified a highly heterotic hybrid (C8605-2 x W1445) and a low heterotic hybrid (C8605-2 x W245) for yield performance in maize from 33 hybrids obtained from an incomplete diallel mating scheme. Using high-density maize oligomicroarrays, we analyzed and compared gene expression profiles of the highly heterotic hybrid, its parent lines, and the low heterotic hybrid. A total of 2,366 differentially expressed genes were identified in C86052 x W1445 and its two parents. These genes exhibited heterogeneous expression patterns in the hybrid relative to its parents, and covering additivity, high-parent dominance, low-parent dominance, overdominance, underdominance, and partial-dominance. The functions of several genes fell in diverse biological processes, including metabolism, signal transduction, transport, biological regulation, and development, among others. Notably, among those highly upregulated genes in the hybrid, there were genes known to play vital roles in stress tolerance and yield enhancement and groups of transcriptional factors that might contribute to overall enhanced quality of the hybrid. Further comparisons between high-and the low-heterotic hybrids also revealed a subset of differentially expressed genes. Together, this genome-wide comparison among maize lines exhibiting varying degrees of heterosis, during the early developmental phase of immature ears, will provide valuable information for further studies on linkage between specific gene expression and phenotype of heterosis.

AB This study reports the discovery of a gene for resistance to septoria tritici blotch (STB) in two spring wheat cultivars, Courtot and Tonic. The gene, named Stb9, confers resistance to Mycosphaerella graminicola isolate IPO89011. It was mapped by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using an existing map of Courtot x Chinese Spring and was located between markers Xfbb226 (3.6 cM) and XksuF1b (9 cM) on the long arm of chromosome 2B. Markers linked to Stb9 in Courtot were then shown to be linked to resistance to IPO89011 in F 3 families of Tonic x Longbow. Allelism tests in which Tonic was crossed with Courtot confirmed that Tonic has a gene for resistance to IPO89011 at or very close to the Stb9 locus. SSR markers flanking Stb9 may be used in marker-assisted selection to introgress this gene into winter cultivars or in spring wheat breeding programmes outside Europe.

AB The fungicide JS399-19 is a novel cyanoacrylate fungicide active against Gibberella zeae, and has been marketed in China for control of fusarium head blight (FHB) on wheat. Forty-three isolates sensitive to fungicide JS399-19 were collected from three commercial wheat fields in China. Forty-five isolates resistant to JS399-19, obtained from five sensitive isolates by selection for resistance to JS399-19, were selected. Three sensitivity levels were identified: sensitive (S), moderately resistant (MR) and highly resistant (HR) to JS399-19, based on a previous study. Eight isolates representing the three sensitivity-level phenotypes were randomly selected for a study on the inheritance of JS399-19 resistance by analysing the sensitivity of hybrid F 1 progeny. A nitrate-non-utilizing mutant (nit) was used as a genetic marker to confirm that individual perithecia were the result of outcrossing. Five crosses were assessed: S x S, S x HR, MR x HR, HR x HR and MR x S. In crosses between parents with different sensitivity levels, such as S x HR, MR x HR and MR x S, the progeny fitted a 1:1 segregation ratio of the two parental phenotypes. No segregation was observed in the crosses S x S and HR x HR. It was concluded that the MR and HR phenotypes in G. zeae were conferred by different allelic mutations within the same locus. In these isolates, resistance to JS399-19 was not affected by modifying genes or cytoplasmic components.

TI Rapid and Targeted Introgression of Genes into Popular Wheat Cultivars
   Using Marker-Assisted Background Selection
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB A marker-assisted background selection (MABS)-based gene introgression approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was optimized, where 97% or more of a recurrent parent genome (RPG) can be recovered in just two backcross (BC) generations. A four-step MABS method was developed based on 'Plabsim' computer simulations and wheat genome structure information. During empirical optimization of this method, double recombinants around the target gene were selected in a step-wise fashion during the two BC cycles followed by selection for recurrent parent genotype on non-carrier chromosomes. The average spacing between carrier chromosome markers was <4 cM. For non-carrier chromosome markers that flanked each of the 48 wheat gene-rich regions, this distance was similar to 12 cM. Employed to introgress seedling stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistance gene Yr15 into the spring wheat cultivar 'Zak', marker analysis of 2,187 backcross-derived progeny resulted in the recovery of a BC(2)F(2:3) plant with 97% of the recurrent parent genome. In contrast, only 82% of the recurrent parent genome was recovered in phenotypically selected BC(4)F(7) plants developed without MABS. Field evaluation results from 17 locations indicated that the MABS-derived line was either equal or superior to the recurrent parent for the tested agronomic characteristics. Based on these results, MABS is recommended as a strategy for rapidly introgressing a targeted gene into a wheat genotype in just two backcross generations while recovering 97% or more of the recurrent parent genotype.

AB Lesion mimics (LM) that resemble plant disease symptoms in the absence of plant pathogens may confer enhanced plant disease resistance to a wide range of pathogens. Wheat line Ning7840 has adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and shows LM symptoms at heading. A recessive gene (lm) was found to be responsible for LM in Ning7840 and located near the proximal region of chromosome 1BL using a population of 179 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from the cross Ning7840/Chokwang. Genomic in situ hybridization showed that Ning7840 carries the short arm of 1R chromosome from rye (Secale cereale L.), on which the race-specific gene Lr26 resides. The RILs were infected with the isolate PRTUS 55, an isolate virulent to Lr26, at anthesis in two greenhouse experiments. The result showed that the lines with LM phenotype had a significantly higher rust resistance than the non-LM lines. Composite interval mapping consistently detected a QTL, Qlr.pser.1BL, for APR on chromosome 1BL. Qlr.pser.1BL peaked at lm and explained up to 60.8% of phenotypic variation for leaf rust resistance in two greenhouse experiments, therefore, lm from Ning7840 may have pleiotropic effects on APR to leaf rust.

AB Plant breeders simultaneously select for qualitative traits controlled by one or a small number of major genes, as well as for polygenic traits controlled by multiple genes that may be detected as quantitative trait loci (QTL). In this study, we applied computer simulation to investigate simultaneous selection for alleles at both major and minor gene (as QTL) loci in breeding populations of two wheat parental lines, HM14BS and Sunstate. Loci targeted for selection included six major genes affecting plant height, disease resistance, and grain quality, plus 6 known and 11 "unidentified" QTL affecting coleoptile length (CL). Parental line HM14BS contributed the target alleles at two of the major gene loci, while parental line Sunstate contributed target alleles at four loci. The parents have similar plant height, but HM14BS has a longer coleoptile, a desirable attribute for deep sowing in rainfed environments. Including the wild-type allele at the major reduced-height locus Rht-D1, HM14BS was assumed to have 13 QTL for increased CL, and Sunstate four; these assumptions being derived from mapping studies and empirical data from an actual HM14BS/Sunstate population. Simulation indicated that compared to backcross populations, a single biparental F-1 cross produced the highest frequency of target genotypes (six desired alleles at major genes plus desired QTL alleles for long CL). From 1,000 simulation runs, an average of 2.4 individuals with the target genotype were present in unselected F-1-derived doubled haploid (DH) or recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations of size 200. A selection scheme for the six major genes increased the number of target individuals to 19.1, and additional marker-assisted selection (MAS) for CL increased the number to 23.0. Phenotypic selection (PS) of CL outperformed MAS in this study due to the high heritability of CL, incompletely linked markers for known QTL, and the existence of unidentified QTL. However, a selection scheme combining MAS and PS was equally as efficient as PS and would result in net savings in production and time to delivery of long coleoptile wheats containing the six favorable alleles.

AB Background: Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple food crop worldwide. The wheat genome has not yet been sequenced due to its huge genome size (similar to 17,000 Mb) and high levels of repetitive sequences; the whole genome sequence may not be expected in the near future. Available linkage maps have low marker density due to limitation in available markers; therefore new technologies that detect genome-wide polymorphisms are still needed to discover a large number of new markers for construction of high-resolution maps. A high-resolution map is a critical tool for gene isolation, molecular breeding and genomic research. Single feature polymorphism (SFP) is a new microarray-based type of marker that is detected by hybridization of DNA or cRNA to oligonucleotide probes. This study was conducted to explore the feasibility of using the Affymetrix GeneChip to discover and map SFPs in the large hexaploid wheat genome.
   Results: Six wheat varieties of diverse origins (Ning 7840, Clark, Jagger, Encruzilhada, Chinese Spring, and Opata 85) were analyzed for significant probe by variety interactions and 396 probe sets with SFPs were identified. A subset of 164 unigenes was sequenced and 54% showed polymorphism within probes. Microarray analysis of 71 recombinant inbred lines from the cross Ning 7840/Clark identified 955 SFPs and 877 of them were mapped together with 269 simple sequence repeat markers. The SFPs were randomly distributed within a chromosome but were unevenly distributed among different genomes. The B genome had the most SFPs, and the D genome had the least. Map positions of a selected set of SFPs were validated by mapping single nucleotide polymorphism using SNaPshot and comparing with expressed sequence tags mapping data.
   Conclusion: The Affymetrix array is a cost-effective platform for SFP discovery and SFP mapping in wheat. The new high-density map constructed in this study will be a useful tool for genetic and genomic research in wheat.

AB Background: Despite great advances in genomic technology observed in several crop species, the availability of molecular tools such as microsatellite markers has been limited in tea ( Camellia sinensis L.). The development of microsatellite markers will have a major impact on genetic analysis, gene mapping and marker assisted breeding. Unigene derived microsatellite (UGMS) markers identified from publicly available sequence database have the advantage of assaying variation in the expressed component of the genome with unique identity and position. Therefore, they can serve as efficient and cost effective alternative markers in such species.
   Results: Considering the multiple advantages of UGMS markers, 1,223 unigenes were predicted from 2,181 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of tea ( Camellia sinensis L.). A total of 109 (8.9%) unigenes containing 120 SSRs were identified. SSR abundance was one in every 3.55 kb of EST sequences. The microsatellites mainly comprised of di (50.8%), tri (30.8%), tetra (6.6%), penta (7.5%) and few hexa (4.1%) nucleotide repeats. Among the dinucleotide repeats, (GA)n.(TC) n were most abundant (83.6%). Ninety six primer pairs could be designed form 83.5% of SSR containing unigenes. Of these, 61 (63.5%) primer pairs were experimentally validated and used to investigate the genetic diversity among the 34 accessions of different Camellia spp. Fifty one primer pairs (83.6%) were successfully cross transferred to the related species at various levels. Functional annotation of the unigenes containing SSRs was done through gene ontology (GO) characterization. Thirty six (60%) of them revealed significant sequence similarity with the known/putative proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. Polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.018 to 0.972 with a mean value of 0.497. The average heterozygosity expected (HE) and observed (Ho) obtained was 0.654 and 0.413 respectively, thereby suggesting highly heterogeneous nature of tea. Further, test for IAM and SMM models for the UGMS loci showed excess heterozygosity and did not show any bottleneck operating in the tea population.
   Conclusion: UGMS markers identified and characterized in this study provided insight about the abundance and distribution of SSR in the expressed genome of C. sinensis. The identification and validation of 61 new UGMS markers will not only help in intra and inter specific genetic diversity assessment but also be enriching limited microsatellite markers resource in tea. Further, the use of these markers would reduce the cost and facilitate the gene mapping and marker- aided selection in tea. Since, 36 of these UGMS markers correspond to the Arabidopsis protein sequence data with known functions will offer the opportunity to investigate the consequences of SSR polymorphism on gene functions.

AB A "directional transfer program" was designed and carried out according to the genotype on the male sterility locus of the target line, in order to improve the utilization of the multiple-allele inherited male sterile gene in Chinese cabbage and solve the problems in the transfer process of this gene. In the program, recurrent backcrossing was employed to transfer botanical traits, while the genotype was identified through test cross. In addition, we began to develop the male sterile line after the transfer of botanical traits was finished. Following the procedure, the male sterile gene was successfully transferred from "3A", a white leafstalk inbred line in Chinese cabbage, to "206", the target green leafstalk inbred line in cylindrical ecotype. The "GMS104", a male sterile line with similar botanical traits to "206" with 100% male sterility and 100% male sterile plants, was bred. With "GMS104" as the female parent, an excellent hybridized combination "GMS104 x B4" was finally obtained and it passed the variety certification and registration of minor crops in Liaoning, China. Based on the results, it was certified that male sterility and the other botanical and economic traits could be transferred to a target line simultaneously following the "directional transfer program" designed in our study.

AB There is interest in Canada wildrye (CWR, Elymus canadensis L.) and Virginia wildrye (VWR, E. virginicus L.) for conservation and forage uses. Our objectives were to identify a set of molecular markers to assess genetic structure within and diversity among populations of CWR and VWR from the Southern Great Plains and to determine if these populations had an associated fungal endophyte. Nine CWR and five VWR populations and two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars were genotyped using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers isolated from tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] expressed sequence tags (TF ESTs). Scorable fragments were produced by 31% of TF EST-SSRs tested, thus identifying a set of SSR markers for wildrye. Populations grouped into three clusters consisting of (i) three wild populations, one plant introduction, and two commercial sources of CWR; (ii) all VWR populations and three CWR plant introductions; and (iii) barley cultivars. Clustering indicated possible gene flow between CWR and VWR. Genetic variation within populations was minimal and comparable to that of the barley cultivars. Thus, unlike many ancestral cultivars and landraces of self-pollinated crops, CWR and VWR populations consisted of essentially pure lines and can be handled as such in a breeding program. Potentially sexual and asexual epichloe endophytes were found in several populations, indicating the need to account for endophytes in breeding and germ-plasm conservation efforts of wildrye.

AB Flowering time represents an important adaptive trait for temperate cereal crops and may also impact on frost damage in cereal reproductive tissues by enabling escape or by influencing accumulation of genuine tolerance. The Flowering time-2L (Flt-2L) quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the distal end of barley chromosome arm 2HL overlaps with QTL for rachis internode length and reproductive frost damage. Flt-2L was also found to be associated with plant height. By combining marker analysis with phenotyping in progeny families of selected Amagi Nijo x WI2585 F(6) recombinants, we were able to map quantitative flowering time, rachis internode length, and plant height effects on 2HL as discrete Mendelian traits. The three developmental characters showed codominant modes of expression and perfectly cosegregated with one another in a 1.3-cM marker interval, indicating control by the same gene or closely linked genes. Twelve genes were identified in the related intervals in the rice and Brachypodium distachyon genomes. The HvAP2 gene cosegregated with Flt-2L and represents a plausible candidate for Flt-2L, since it is highly similar to the wheat domestication gene Q which has similar developmental effects. These data will contribute to isolation of the Flt-2L gene(s) and help establish the basis of the frost damage QTL.

AB The barley sdw1/denso gene not only controls plant height but also yield and quality. The sdw1/denso gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 3H. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the sdw1/denso gene was located in the syntenic region of the rice semidwarf gene sd1 on chromosome 1. The sd1 gene encodes a gibberellic acid (GA)-20 oxidase enzyme. The gene ortholog of rice sd1 was isolated from barley using polymerase chain reaction. The barley and rice genes showed a similar gene structure consisting of three exons and two introns. Both genes share 88.3% genomic sequence similarity and 89% amino acid sequence identity. A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified in intron 2 between barley varieties Baudin and AC Metcalfe with Baudin known to contain the denso semidwarf gene. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker was mapped to chromosome 3H in a doubled haploid population of Baudin x AC Metcalfe with 178 DH lines. Quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that plant height cosegregated with the SNP. The sdw1/denso gene in barley is the most likely ortholog of the sd1 in rice. The result will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling semidwarf phenotype and provide a diagnostic marker for selection of semidwarf gene in barley.

AB Isolates of the entomopathogenic fungus Entomophthora muscae were obtained from houseflies sampled at five stables on Zealand during an epidemic in fall 2005. DNA fingerprints were generated from single conidia from 40 E. muscae isolates using the PCR-based method of Inter-Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR). This resulted in finger-print patterns consisting of about 50 fragments, of which, 14 were polymorphic. From the polymorphic loci we estimated the reproductive mode, genetic differentiation and gene diversity of E. muscae populations using the statistics of index of association, Weir & Cockerhams theta and Nei's analysis of gene diversity in subdivided populations. Our results revealed no significant differences in allele frequencies among the five populations. The index of association test rejected the null hypothesis of random mating, but the test for paired locus compatibility showed weak or no linkage between loci indicating recombination or homoplasy in the dataset. From this study we cannot exclude the possibility that the population genetic structure underlying E. muscae epidemics could be panmictic consisting of several lineages with a high level of reciprocal migration.

AB Rust fungi are obligate parasites and cannot be routinely cultured to obtain sufficient biomass for DNA extractions. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) was demonstrated in this study for whole genome amplification from single spores of the rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis. The genomic DNA coverage and fidelity of this method was evaluated by PCR amplification and sequencing of two genetic markers: portions of the multi-copy nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and the single copy beta-tubulin gene from two geographical diverse isolates. our results show that MDA is a valuable tool for whole genome amplification from single spores, and we propose that MDA-amplified DNA can be used for molecular genetic analysis of the wheat yellow rust fungus.

AB Monogenically-inherited resistance to Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) in hexaploid bread wheat cultivars 'Tremie' and 'Claire' was mapped on chromosome 5D. The two closest flanking markers identified in the Claire-derived mapping population, Xgwm469-5D and E37M49, are linked to the resistance locus at distances of 1 and 9 cm, respectively. Xgwm469-5D co-segregated with the SBCMV resistance in the Tremie-derived population and with the recently identified Sbm1 locus in the cv. Cadenza. This suggested that Tremie and Claire carry a resistance gene allelic to Sbm1, or one closely linked to it. The diagnostic value of Xgwm469-5D was assessed using a collection of SBCMV resistant and susceptible cultivars. Importantly, all susceptible genotypes carried a null allele of Xgwm469-5D, whereas resistant genotypes presumably related to either Claire and Tremie or Cadenza revealed a 152 or 154 bp allele of Xgwm469-5D, respectively. Therefore, Xgwm469-5D is well suited for marker assisted selection for SBCMV resistance.

AB Fusarium asiaticum and F. graminearum are the primary causal agents of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat in China. In this study, sensitivities of 159 F. asiaticum and F. graminearum isolates to a benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim (MBC) and to sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) tebuconazole and prochloraz were determined. Among the 159 isolates, 9 were resistant to MBC and designated as MBC-R isolates. Three showed resistance to tebuconazole and prochloraz and designated as DMI-R isolates. There was no cross-resistance between MBC and DMI. Genetic analysis by microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that MBC-R or DMI-R isolates had different genotypes, which indicated that they originated from different wild-type parents. Analysis of two 14 alpha-demethylase (cyp51) homologous genes (cyp51A and cyp51B) showed that the F. asiaticum isolates could be distinguished from F. graminearum isolates based on the sequence of cyp51A. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequence of cyp51A and cyp51B suggested that no mutations were associated with DMI resistance. Realtime PCR analysis showed that the DMI resistance was not related to the expression of cyp51A and cyp51B in F. asiaticum and F. graminearum, but expressions of both genes were induced greatly by the tebuconazole. Results of this study indicated that cyp51A would be an informative marker for analysis of population structure of F. asiaticum and F. graminearum, and the existence of homologous cyp51 genes in F. asiaticum and F. graminearum could provide new insights into DMI resistance in phytopathogenic fungi.

AB Over 3.5 million expressed sequence tags from the major cereal taxa were used to electronically mine over 176 000 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The density, distribution and degree of linkage between these SNPs were compared among the different taxa. The frequency of sequence polymorphism was lowest in diploid taxa (rice, barley and sorghum), intermediate in tetraploid maize and highest in allohexaploid wheat and octoploid sugarcane. SNPs were further categorized as either intravarietal (differences between gene family members and homoeologues) or varietal (differences between two varieties), and as either co-segregating or non-co-segregating with neighbouring polymorphisms. Varietal co-segregating SNPs represent the best candidates for molecular markers as they show variation between varieties and have a high probability of being validated, as sequencing errors are unlikely to co-segregate with one another. This elite class of SNPs was most abundant in barley and least abundant in wheat and rice. Despite the large number of observed sequence polymorphisms in allohexaploid wheat, only a fraction of those available are likely to make good molecular markers. In addition, we found that rice SNPs up to 10 kb apart were in linkage disequilibrium (LD), but that high levels of LD attributable to population structure confounded the tracking of LD over greater distances.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms are the most common polymorphism in plant and animal genomes and, as such, are the logical choice for marker-assisted selection. However, many plants are also polyploid, and marker-assisted selection can be complicated by the presence of highly similar, but non-allelic, homoeologous sequences. Despite this, there is practical and academic demand for high-throughput genotyping in several polyploid crop species, such as allohexaploid wheat. In this paper, we present such a system, which utilizes public single nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified in both agronomically important genes and in randomly selected, mapped, expressed sequence tags developed by the wheat community. To achieve relatively high levels of multiplexing, we used non-amplified genomic DNA and padlock probe pairs, together with high annealing temperatures, to differentiate between similar sequences in the wheat genome. Our results suggest that padlock probes are capable of discriminating between homoeologous sequences and hence can be used to efficiently genotype wheat varieties.

AB To study the genetic mechanism underlying the tissue culture response (TCR) of immature embryos, callus induction and regeneration were performed in two separate trials using the recombinant inbred line (RIL) derived from a cross of Nanda2419 with Wangshuibai. In the first trial, immature embryos were collected from plants grown in the greenhouse in the winter of 2005; while in the second trial, immature embryos were collected from donor plants grown in the field during the growing season. Through whole genome screening, seven chromosome regions conditioning percent embryos forming embryogenic callus (PEFEC) and one conditioning percent callus pieces regenerating plantlets (PCRP) were detected. These QTLs were distributed on chromosomes of homoeologous groups 2, 3, 5 and 7. Among all, QPefec.nau-3B.2, QPefec.nau-7D, and QPcrp.nau-3A were consistently identified. The relationship of these identified wheat TCR QTLs with those of other cereal crops has been evaluated. PCR markers linked to TCR QTLs would facilitate germplasm identification, marker-assisted evaluation and utilization of these QTLs.

AB Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) has been recently recognized as an emerging model system for both comparative and functional genomics in grass species. In this study, 55,221 repeat masked Brachypodium BAC end sequences (BES) were used for comparative analysis against the 12 rice pseudomolecules. The analysis revealed that similar to 26.4% of BES have significant matches with the rice genome and 82.4% of the matches were homologous to known genes. Further analysis of paired-end BES and similar to 1.0 Mb sequences from nine selected BACs proved to be useful in revealing conserved regions and regions that have undergone considerable genomic changes. Differential gene amplification, insertions/deletions and inversions appeared to be the common evolutionary events that caused variations of microcolinearity at different orthologous genomic regions. It was found that similar to 17% of genes in the two genomes are not colinear in the orthologous regions. Analysis of BAC sequences also revealed higher gene density (similar to 9 kb/gene) and lower repeat DNA content (similar to 13.1%) in Brachypodium when compared to the orthologous rice regions, consistent with the smaller size of the Brachypodium genome. The 119 annotated Brachypodium genes were BLASTN compared against the wheat EST database and deletion bin mapped wheat ESTs. About 77% of the genes retrieved significant matches in the EST database, while 9.2% matched to the bin mapped ESTs. In some cases, genes in single Brachypodium BACs matched to multiple ESTs that were mapped to the same deletion bins, suggesting that the Brachypodium genome will be useful for ordering wheat ESTs within the deletion bins and developing specific markers at targeted regions in the wheat genome.

AB A set of 110 diploid putative introgression lines (ILs) containing chromatin introgressed from the undomesticated species Hordeum bulbosum L. (bulbous barley grass) into cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has been identified using a high-copy number retrotransposon-like PCR marker, pSc119.1, derived from rye (Secale cereale L.). To evaluate these lines, 92 EST-derived markers were developed by marker sequencing across four barley cultivars and four H. bulbosum genotypes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions conserved between the two species were then used to develop a set of fully informative cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers or size polymorphic insertion/deletion markers. Introgressed chromatin from H. bulbosum was confirmed and genetically located in 88 of these lines using 46 of the EST-derived PCR markers. A total of 96 individual introgressions were detected with most of them (94.8%) extending to the most distal marker for each respective chromosome arm. Introgressions were detected on all chromosome arms except chromosome 3HL. Interstitial or sub-distal introgressions also occurred, with two located on chromosome 2HL and one each on 3HS, 5HL and 6HS. Twenty-two putative ILs that were positive for H. bulbosum chromatin using pSc119.1 have not had introgressions detected with these single-locus markers. When all introgressions are combined, more than 36% of the barley genetic map has now been covered with introgressed chromatin from H. bulbosum. These ILs represent a significant germplasm resource for barley improvement that can be mined for diverse traits of interest to barley breeders and researchers.

AB Frost at flowering can cause significant damage to cereal crops. QTL for low temperature tolerance in reproductive tissues (LTR tolerance) were previously described on barley 2HL and 5HL chromosome arms. With the aim of identifying potential LTR tolerance mechanisms, barley Amagi Nijo x WI2585 and Haruna Nijo x Galleon populations were examined for flowering time and spike morphology traits associated with the LTR tolerance loci. In spring-type progeny of both crosses, winter alleles at the Vrn-H1 vernalization response locus on 5H were linked in coupling with LTR tolerance and were unexpectedly associated with earlier flowering. In contrast, tolerance on 2HL was coupled with late flowering alleles at a locus we named Flt-2L. Both chromosome regions influenced chasmogamy/cleistogamy (open/closed florets), although tolerance was associated with cleistogamy at the 2HL locus and chasmogamy at the 5HL locus. LTR tolerance controlled by both loci was accompanied by shorter spikes, which were due to fewer florets per spike on 5HL, but shorter rachis internodes on 2HL. The Eps-2S locus also segregated in both crosses and influenced spike length and flowering time but not LTR tolerance. Thus, none of the traits was consistently correlated with LTR tolerance, suggesting that the tolerance may be due to some other visible trait or an intrinsic (biochemical) property. Winter alleles at the Vrn-H1 locus and short rachis internodes may be of potential use in barley breeding, as markers for selection of LTR tolerance at 5HL and 2HL loci, respectively.

AB Resistance gene H26, derived from Aegilops tauschii Coss., is one of the most effective R genes against the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)], an important pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Using a limited number of PCR-based molecular markers a previous study mapped H26 to the wheat chromosomal deletion bin 3DL3-0.81-1.00. The objectives of this study were to saturate the chromosomal region harboring H26 with newly developed PCR-based markers and to investigate the collinearity of this wheat chromosomal region with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon genome. A population of 96 F(2) individuals segregating at the H26 gene locus was used for saturation mapping. All wheat ESTs assigned to the deletion bin 3DL3-0.81-1.00 were used to design STS (sequence tagged site) primers. The wheat ESTs mapped near H26 were further used to BLAST rice and B. distachyon genomic sequences for comparative mapping. To date, 26 newly developed STS markers have been mapped to the chromosomal region spanning the H26 locus. Two of them were mapped 1.0 cM away from the H26 locus. Comparative analysis identified genomic regions on rice chromosome 1 and Brachypodium Super contig 13 which are collinear with the genomic region spanning the H26 locus within the distal region of 3DL. The newly developed STS markers closely linked to H26 will be useful for mapped-based cloning of H26 and marker-assisted selection of this gene in wheat breeding. The results will also enhance understanding of this chromosomal region which contains several other Hessian fly resistance genes.

AB The QTLs for quality traits of Chinese dry noodle (CDN) were mapped based on a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between two Chinese winter wheat varieties, Chuan 35050 and Shannong 483. Sensory quality traits of CDN were tested according to the standard of Ministry of Commerce of P.R.China (SB/T10137-93), and the textural property traits were detected using a texture analyser (TA.XTplus). We have obtained 8 putative QTLs for 6 sensory quality traits and 2 QTLs for textural property of CDN with a single QTL explainning 4.07-75.67% of phenotypic variations on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 3D, 4A, and 6D. A cluster of 3 QTLs for palate, elasticity and smoothness of CDN was found near the Glu-D1 locus on chromosome ID with high contributions. The increasing effect come from Chuan 35050, and the relationship between the QTLs were positive. On chromosome 4A, co-location QTLs for stickiness and total score were detected in the region of Xwmc420-Xswes620-Xswes615. Their contributions were high and the increasing effects come from Shannong 483. A taste QTL QStas.sdau-4A.1 was obtained in Xsrap18-Xswes624c-Xissr25b-Xissr23b on chromosome 4A with the highest contribution of 75.67%. This QTL was a major gene and the increasing effects come from Shannong 483.

AB A collection of 5006 full-length (FL) cDNA sequences was developed in barley. Fifteen mRNA samples from various organs and treatments were pooled to develop a cDNA library using the CAP trapper method. More than 60% of the clones were confirmed to have complete coding sequences, based on comparison with rice amino acid and UniProt sequences. Blastn homologies (E < 1E-5) to rice genes and Arabidopsis genes were 89 and 47%, respectively. Of the 5028 possible amino acid sequences derived from the 5006 FLcDNAs, 4032 (80.2%) were classified into 1678 GreenPhyl multigenic families. There were 555 cDNAs showing low homology to both rice and Arabidopsis. Gene ontology annotation by InterProScan indicated that many of these cDNAs (71%) have no known molecular functions and may be unique to barley. The cDNAs showed high homology to Barley 1 GeneChip oligo probes (81%) and the wheat gene index (84%). The high homology between FLcDNAs (27%) and mapped barley expressed sequence tag enabled assigning linkage map positions to 151-233 FLcDNAs on each of the seven barley chromosomes. These comprehensive barley FLcDNAs provide strong platform to connect preexisting genomic and genetic resources and accelerate gene identification and genome analysis in barley and related species.

AB Fifteen novel microsatellite markers were isolated from Fusarium graminearum. The level of polymorphism at these novel and 13 previously published microsatellite markers was analysed in 33 F. graminearum strains from Europe, North America, and Nepal. The number of alleles for each of the novel markers ranged from 4 to 20 and gene diversity from 0.417 to 0.962. In comparison with the previously published markers, the resolution for distinguishing among different strains was slightly increased. Twenty-seven markers were also detectable in three F. culmorum strains and one F. crookwellense strain. None of the markers was detected in three F. avenaceum and four F. poae strains, underlining the potential use of these microsatellite markers for species differentiation.

AB Wheat yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici) (PST) has been described as a strongly clonal species in both European and Australian populations, with very limited molecular diversity but rapidly evolving virulences. Contrastingly, marked genetic diversity has been reported in Chinese PST populations. To test whether such variability could originate from oversummering areas, we assessed the diversity of virulence and molecular markers (AFLP and SSR) using 412 PST isolates from the highlands of Tianshui county in Gansu province. Very marked phenotypic and genotypic diversity (38% and 89%, respectively) was found. No genetic structure dependent on the sites sampled (Fst = 0.004) or altitude distribution (Fst = 0.0098) was detected, indicating important gene flow at the county scale. This study also revealed genetic recombination between molecular markers and thus strongly suggests the existence of a sexual or parasexual cycle in PST in Tianshui county. The observations of higher rates of sexual spore production in genotypes originating from Tianshui are the very first elements suggestive of the existence of a sexual cycle in this species.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with epistatic and QTL x environment (QE) interaction for heading date were studied using a doubled haploid (DH) population containing 168 progeny lines derived from a cross between two elite Chinese wheat cultivars Huapei 3 x Yumai 57 (Triticum aestivum L.). A genetic map was constructed based on 305 marker loci, consisting of 283 SSR loci and 22 EST-SSR markers, which covered a total length of 2141.7 cM with an average distance of 7.02 cM between adjacent markers in the genome. QTL analyses were performed using a mixed linear model approach. Two main-effect QTLs and two pairs of digenic epistatic effects were detected for heading date on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5D, 6D, 7A, and 7D at three different environments in 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons. A highly significant QTL with an F-value 148.96, designated as Qhd5D, was observed within the Xbarc320-Xwmc215 interval on chromosome 5DL, accounting for 53.19% of the phenotypic variance and reducing days-to-heading by 2.77 days. The Qhd5D closely links with a PCR marker Xwmc215 with the genetic distance 2.1 cM, which can be used in molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programs. Moreover, the Qhd5D was located on the similar position of well-characterised vernalization sensitivity gene Vrn-D1. We are also spending more efforts to develop near-isogenic lines to finely map the Qhd5D and clone the gene Vrn-D1 through map-based cloning. The Qhd1B with additive effect on heading date has not been reported in previous linkage mapping studies, which might be a photoperiod-sensitive gene homoeologous to the Ppd-H2 gene on chromosome 1B. No main-effect QTLs for heading date were involved in epistatic effects.

AB The allotetraploid species Aegilops variabilis Eig (2n = 28, UUS(v)S(v)) belongs to the tribe Triticeae and is closely related to wheat. One accession, Ae. variabilis No. 1, was found to be resistant to the cereal cyst nematode (CCN) and the root-knot nematode (RKN). As the genetic variability for resistance to those two pests is limited within wheat, this accession was crossed to bread wheat. Previous work enabled the development of two addition lines and two translocation lines carrying resistance. Here, we demonstrate, using genomic in situ hybridization, that there is no U-S(v) interchange in the parental accession of Ae. variabilis. However, there are multiple rearrangements in the S(v) chromosomes. The Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying the CreX gene for resistance to CCN combined segments with homoeology to wheat groups 1, 2, 4, and 6. The CreX gene belongs to the group 1 part and it was likely to have been introduced into chromosome 1BL at a similar location as the previously found QTL QCre.srd-1B for CCN resistance. The second Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying CreY and Rkn2 combined segments with homoeology to wheat groups 2, 4, and 7 on its short arm and group 3 on its long arm. It was designated as 3S(v). The two genes for resistance are carried by its long arm and have been transferred to wheat chromosome 3BL through homoeologous and genetically balanced recombination. Different SSR markers present in the introgressed segments could be used in marker-assisted selection.

AB The PI 386148 triticale from Russia is among the highest resistant line to the Russian wheat aphid (RWA) (Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko)). This triticale line was used as the male parent in crosses with Lamar wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The F(1) plants were backcrossed to Lamar wheat. The progenies were tested for RWA biotype 1 reaction for at least eight backcross and selfing generations. Five lines from these selections were identified for their resistance to the RWA and their seeds were increased for agronomic and other characterizations. Molecular and cytological analyses of these lines were performed using genomic in situ hybridization and rye chromosome-specific microsatellites markers. Three lines were cytologically stable and carried a pair of rye (Secale strictum (C. Presl) C. Presl) chromosomes as disomic addition lines of 1R. One line was unstable and showed a moderate level of mixoploidy with monosomic additions of 1R. Duplication of rye chromosome 1R was also identified. No wheat-rye chromosome interchange was detected, suggesting little homology between S. strictum and T. aestivum chromosomes. Specific microsatellite primers were used to identify the rye chromosomes present in each line. One rye chromosome, 1R, from the donor species contains genes for RWA resistance. Grain yield and test weight of three of the lines were similar to some adapted released wheat varieties under stress conditions.

AB Bi-allelic STS marker was used to confirm the presence of adult plant durable rust resistance gene Lr34 in advance generation breeding lines. These lines were scored for leaf rust three times at an equal interval and the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was Calculated. The lower AUDPC values of Lr34 positive lines confirmed their slow rusting nature. In the absence of direct selection method, the breeders are selecting Lr34 gene carrying lines unintentionally as they showed better resistance. Lines possessing Lr34, an 'undefeated genic', Should be used in breeding programme in order to have a broad-spectrum durable leaf rust resistance.

AB Genetic subdivision of Fusarium asiaticum was investigated using a collection of 478 isolates originating from the Kyushu area and Aichi Prefecture, Japan and Zhejiang Province in China. Trichothecene-type determination by a multiplex PCR-test indicated that all isolates were either of a nivalenol (NIV) or a 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON) type. The 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol (15ADON) type was not detected in this collection. Based on a Bayesian model-based clustering method using allele data obtained with 11 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) markers, we detected three genetic clusters. The majority of isolates in the clusters were NIV isolates from both Japan and China, Japanese 3ADON and Chinese 3ADON isolates, respectively. High levels of fixation indices and low levels of effective number of migrants were observed between the genetic clusters. Data was re-analyzed by classifying the isolates into six groups according to trichothecene type and geographic location. Population analyses of these re-classified groups indicated that the genetic subdivisions of F. asiaticum were correlated with both trichothecene type and geographic differences.

AB Large numbers of genetic markers are needed for genomic analyses in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). We previously identified 53 simple sequence repeat (SS R) markers from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database using a high selection standard. We mined the same EST database again using a lower threshold (>5 di-nucleotide and 4 other repeats) and identified 330 new SSR-containing ESTs. primers were designed for 201 suitable sequences, and PCR Was Successful for 137. The screening of 113 primer pairs that produced fragments shorter than 800 bp produced 66 polymorphic SSR markers, which were characterized in 30 oysters from three populations and a full-sib family. The SSRs had an average of 5.4 alleles per locus. ranging from 2-12. Thirty-four loci segregated in the family, with seven showing significant deviation from Mendelian ratios after Bonferroni correction. Null-alleles were observed at 17 loci. The EST-derived SSRs are part of expressed genes, and most of them should be useful for gene and genome mapping. This study shows that more SSR markers can be developed from ESTs using lower selection standards.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide. Pyramiding different resistance genes into single cultivar has been proposed as one remedy to provide durable resistance. Powdery mildew resistance genes Pm12 (T6BS-6SS.6SL), transferred from Aegilops speltoides to wheat cv. Wembley, and Pm21 (T6VS.6AL), introduced from Dasypyrum villosum to wheat cv. Yangmai5, conferred broad-spectrum resistance to B. graminis f. sp. tritici. Both Pm12 and Pm21 genes are located on the short arms of homologous group six involved translocated chromosomes 6SS.6BL and 6VS.6AL, respectively. Simple sequence repeat motifs of wheat simple sequence repeat (SSR) and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences on the short arm of homologous group six chromosomes were analyzed to develop molecular markers for discriminating chromosome arms 6AS, 6BS, 6DS, 6VS, and 6SS. One EST-SSR marker, Xcau127, was polymorphic, and therefore can be used to distinguish the two resistance genes and the respective susceptible alleles. This marker allowed us to develop an efficient "one-marker-for-two-genes" procedure for identifying powdery mildew resistance genes Pm12 and Pm21 for marker-assisted selection and gene pyramiding in wheat breeding programs.

AB Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is one of the major diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew is considered more durable than resistance conferred by major race-specific resistance genes. The objective of the present study was a better understanding of the genetic basis of APR in RE714 by means of QTL analysis of several resistance scores along the growing season. A population of 160 recombinant inbred lines obtained from the cross between RE714 and Hardi (susceptible) was assessed for APR under natural infection conditions during 3 years and a genetic map with whole genome coverage was developed with microsatellite and AFLP markers in this population. Two major QTL on chromosomes 5D and 6A were detected each year, and 6 minor QTL were detected only in 1 or 2 years. The QTL on chromosome 5D was detected during all the growing season each year and its R (2) value varied between 8.5 and 56.3%, whereas the QTL on chromosome 6A was detected at 1-4 scoring dates in the 3 years, and its R (2) value varied between 6.1 and 20.5%. The two QTL explained between 24.4 and 52.1% of the phenotypic variance for AUDPC, depending on the year. The models including QTL and cofactors in the composite interval mapping explained between 29 and 72% of the variance. The molecular markers linked to the two major QTL could be used in marker-assisted selection for adult plant resistance to powdery mildew.

TI Detection of Virulence to Resistance Gene Sr36 Within the TTKS Race
   Lineage of Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici
SO PLANT DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID MARKERS; WHEAT
AB The stem rust resistance gene Sr36 confers it near-immune resistance reaction to many races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and is highly effective against race TTKSK (syn. Ug99), which possesses unusually broad virulence combinations. Because this gene is widely used in United States soft winter wheat germplasm and cultivars, it has been considered to be an important source of resistance to TTKSK. In 2007, moderately susceptible infection responses were observed on wheat lines and cultivars carrying Sr36 in a field screening nursery for stem rust at Njoro, Kenya. We derived 19 single-pustule isolates from stem rust samples collected from the 2007 Njoro nursery. The isolates were evaluated for virulence oil 20 North American stem rust differential lines and on wheat lines and cultivars carrying Sr36, Sr31+Sr36, and Sr24+Sr31. Of the 18 isolates, 10 produced infection types 3+ to 4 on line W2691SrTt-1 (monogenic for Sr36) and other lines that carry Sr36 and belonged to a new virulence phenotype that was not detected in previous years. These isolates were identified as race TTTSK. The remaining eight isolates were identified its races TTKSK (five isolates) and TTKST (three isolates), with avirulence and virulence, respectively, to Sr24. Thirteen simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to examine the genetic relationships among the three races in the TTKS lineage. All isolates in the lineage shared ail identical SSR genotype and were clearly different from North American races. In all, 16 wheat cultivars and 60 elite breeding lines, postulated to possess Sr36, were susceptible to race TTTSK. The occurrence of race TTTSK with combined virulence oil Sr31 and Sr36 has further broadened the virulence spectrum of the TTKS lineage and rendered an important source of resistance ineffective.

AB (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting and pheS sequence analysis of 18 Lactobacillus rossiae isolates, mainly originating from Belgian and Italian artisan sourdoughs, revealed intraspecies grouping as evidenced by the delineation of three and two subgroups, respectively. On the other hand, 16S rRNA and rpoA gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridizations supported the accommodation of all isolates in a single species. No correlation between genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity was observed. Collectively, these data do not warrant taxonomic division of L. rossiae. On the other hand, the considerable differences in intraspecies sequence variation of L. rossiae isolates displayed by the pheS (9.8%) and rpoA (1.1%) genes highlight that the discriminatory power of housekeeping genes as alternative genomic markers for the 16S rRNA gene in the identification of Lactobacillus species may significantly differ from gene to gene. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that a polyphasic approach remains highly useful for identification of isolates belonging to genotypically heterogeneous species such as L. rossiae.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a very destructive wheat (Triticum aestivum) disease. Resistance was transferred from Elytrigia intermedium to common wheat by crossing and backcrossing, and line GRY19, that was subsequently selected, possessed a single dominant gene for seedling resistance. Five polymorphic microsatellite markers, Xgwm297, Xwmc335, Xwmc364, Xwmc426 and Xwmc476, on chromosome arm 7BS, were mapped relative to the powdery mildew resistance locus in an F(2) population of Mianyang 11/GRY19. The loci order Xwmc426-Xwmc335-Pm40-Xgwm297-Xwmc364-Xwmc476, with 5.9, 0.2, 0.7, 1.2 and 2.9 cM genetic distances, was consistent with published maps. The resistance gene transferred from Elytrigia intermedium into wheat line GRY19 was novel, and was designated Pm40. The close flanking markers will enable marker assisted transfer of this gene into wheat breeding populations.

AB Powdery mildew resistance from Thinopyrum intermedium was introgressed into common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Genetic analysis of the F(1), F(2), F(3) and BC(1) populations from powdery mildew resistant line CH5025 revealed that resistance was controlled by a single dominant allele. The gene responsible for powdery mildew resistance was mapped by the linkage analysis of a segregating F(2) population. The resistance gene was linked to five co-dominant genomic SSR markers (Xcfd233, Xwmc41, Xbarc11, Xgwm539 and Xwmc175) and their most likely order was Xcfd233-Xwmc41-Pm43-Xbarc11-Xgwm539-Xwmc175 at 2.6, 2.3, 4.2, 3.5 and 7.0 cM, respectively. Using the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines, the polymorphic markers and the resistance gene were assigned to chromosome 2DL. As no powdery mildew resistance gene was previously assigned to chromosome 2DL, this new resistance gene was designated Pm43. Pm43, together with the identified closely linked markers, could be useful in marker-assisted selection for pyramiding powdery mildew resistance genes.

AB Autonomic dysreflexia is a potentially life-threatening hypertensive syndrome following high thoracic (T) spinal cord injury (SCI). It is commonly triggered by noxious pelvic stimuli below the injury site that correlates with increased sprouting of primary afferent C-fibers into the lumbosacral (L/S) spinal cord. We have recently demonstrated that injury-induced plasticity of (L/S) propriospinal neurons, which relay pelvic visceral sensations to thoracolumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons, is also correlated with the development of this syndrome. To determine the phenotype of pelvic afferent fiber sprouts after SCI, cholera toxin subunit beta (CTb) was injected into the distal colon 2 weeks post-T4 transection/sham to label colonic visceral afferents. After 1 week of transport, the (US) spinal cords were cryo-sectioned and immunohistochemically stained for CTb, the nociceptive-specific marker calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and the myelinated fiber marker RT97. Quantitative analysis showed that the density of CGRP(+) afferent fibers was significantly increased in the US dorsal horns of T4-transected versus sham rats, whereas RT97(+) afferent fiber density showed no change. Importantly, CTb-labeled pelvic afferent fibers were co-localized with CGRP(+) fibers, but not with RT97(+) fibers. These results suggest that the sprouting of unmyelinated nociceptive pelvic afferents following high thoracic SCI, but not myelinated fibers, contributes to hypertensive autonomic dysreflexia induced by pelvic visceral pain.

AB Molecular markers are important tools that have been used to identify the short arm of rye chromosome 1R (1RS) which contains many useful genes introgressed into wheat background. Wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences are valuable for developing molecular markers since ESTs are derived from gene transcripts and more likely to be conserved between wheat and its relative species. In the present study, 35 sequence-tagged site (STS) primers were designed based on EST sequences distributed on homology group 1 chromosomes of Triticum aestivum and used to screen specific markers for chromosome 1RS of Secale cereale. Two primer pairs different from the early studies, STS(WE3), which amplified a 1680-bp and a 1750-bp fragment, and STS(WE126), which produced a 850-bp fragment from rye genome, were proved to be specific to chromosome 1RS since the corresponding fragments were only amplified from 1R chromosome addition line and wheat-rye lines with chromosome 1RS, but not from wheat-rye 2R-7R chromosome addition lines and the other lines lacking chromosome 1RS. Eleven wheat-rye lines derived from 'Xiaoyan 6' and 'German White' were used to test the presence of specific markers for 1RS. The specific fragments of 1RS were amplified in 4 wheat-rye lines, but not in the other lines. The testing results using EST-STS markers of 1RS were consistent with those obtained from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), suggesting that these markers specific to 1RS could be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for incorporating 1RS into wheat cultivars in breeding.

AB A segregation test confirmed that the genes present on chromosome 1A encoding red and black glumes are allelic to one another. Similarly, the chromosome 1D genes for smokey-grey and red glume coloration are allelic. Consensus maps of chromosomes 1A and 1D carrying Rg-A1 and Rg-D1, respectively, were derived from extant genotypic data. The Gli-B1 associated microsatellite MW1B002 mapped 2cM proximal from Rg-B1. The association of red glume coloration with specific MW1B002 alleles is described for a set of Russian, Albanian, Indian and Nepalese bread wheats.

AB Toward the ultimate goal of replacing field-based evaluation of seasonal growth habit, we describe the design and validation of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay diagnostic for allelic status at the barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare L.) vernalization locus, VRN-H1. By assaying for the presence of all known insertion-deletion polymorphisms thought to be responsible for the difference between spring and winter alleles, this assay directly tests for the presence of functional polymorphism at VPN-H1. Four of the nine previously recognized VPN-H1 haplotypes (including both winter alleles) give unique profiles using this assay. The remaining five spring haplotypes share a single profile, indicative of function-altering deletions spanning, or adjacent to, the putative "vernalization critical" region of intron 1. When used in conjunction with a previously published PCR-based assay diagnostic for alleles at VPN-H2, it was possible to predict growth habit in all the 100 contemporary UK spring and winter lines analyzed in this study. This assay is likely to find application in instances when seasonal growth habit needs to be determined without the time and cost of phenotypic assessment and during marker-assisted selection using conventional and multicross population analysis.

AB Plant breeding methodologies have been applied to flue-cured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) for approximately seven decades. As has been observed in several other crops, stringent quality requirements have resulted in use of conservative breeding strategies in the development of new cultivars. The impact of breeding practices on genetic diversity within U.S. flue-cured tobacco germplasm has not been investigated. In this study, we genotyped 117 tobacco cultivars from eight sequential time periods with 71 microsatellite primer pairs. A total of 294 alleles were scored. Only a fraction (48%) of alleles present in the initial germplasm pool was represented in cultivars released during the 1990s and 2000s. Only 13 and 18 alleles were detected in the 1990s and 2000s, respectively, which were undetected in the initial gene pool. The overall trend was one of gradual reduction in allelic counts at microsatellite loci, indicating a reduction in diversity over time at the gene level. Average genetic similarity was highest among cultivars of the 1990s and 2000s, reflecting a reduction in genetic diversity at the population level. This observed narrowing of the U.S. flue-cured tobacco germplasm base in combination with low rates of genetic gain for yield in the last 20 years may point to a need for diversification of parental materials used in future breeding crosses. Reported genetic relationships among the group of genotyped cultivars may be valuable for future strategic germplasm choices.

AB Flowering time is a trait which has a major influence on the quality of forage. In addition, flowering and subsequent seed yields are important traits for seed production by grass breeders. In this study, we have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flowering time and morphological traits of the flowering head in an F(1) mapping population in Lolium perenne L (perennial ryegrass), a number of which have not previously been identified in L. perenne mapping studies. QTL for days to heading (DTH) were mapped in both outdoor and glasshouse experiments, revealing three and five QTL for DTH which explained 53% and 42% of the total phenotypic variation observed, respectively. Two QTL for DTH were detected in both environments, although they had contrasting relative magnitudes in each environment. One QTL for spike length and three QTL for spikelets per spike were also identified explaining, a total of 32 and 33% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Furthermore, the QTL for spike length and spikelets per spike generally coincided with QTL for days to heading, implying co-ordinate regulation by underlying genes. Of particular interest was a region harbouring overlapping QTL for days to heading, spike length and spikelets per spike on the top of linkage group 4, containing the major QTL for spike length identified in this population.

AB Near isogenic lines (NILs) varying for genes for reduced height (Rht) and photoperiod insensitivity (Ppd-D1a) in a cv. Mercia background (rht (tall), Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1c, Rht8c + Ppd-D1a, Rht-D1c, Rht12) were compared at one field site but within contrasting ('organic' vs. 'conventional') rotational and agronomic contexts, in each of 3 years. In the final year, further NILs (rht (tall), Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1c, Rht-B1b + Rht-D1b, Rht-D1b + Rht-B1c) in both Maris Huntsman and Maris Widgeon backgrounds were added together with 64 lines of a doubled haploid (DH) population [Savannah (Rht-D1b) x Renesansa (Rht-8c + Ppd-D1a)]. Assessments included laboratory tests of germination and coleoptile length, and various field measurements of crop growth between emergence and pre jointing [plant population, tillering, leaf length, ground cover (GC), interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), crop dry matter (DM) and nitrogen accumulation (N), far red: red reflectance ratio (FR:R), crop height, and weed dry matter]. All of the dwarfing alleles except Rht12 in the Mercia background and Rht8c in the DHs were associated with reduced coleoptile length. Most of the dwarfing alleles (depending on background) reduced seed viability. Severe dwarfing alleles (Rht-B1c, Rht-D1c and Rht12) were routinely associated with fewer plant numbers and reduced early crop growth (GC, PAR, DM, N, FR:R), and in 1 year, increased weed DM. In the Mercia background and the DHs the semi-dwarfing allele Rht-D1b was also sometimes associated with reductions in early crop growth; no such negative effects were associated with the marker for Rht8c. When significant interactions between cropping system and genotype did occur it was because differences between lines were more exaggerated in the organic system than in the conventional system. Ppd-D1a was associated positively with plant numbers surviving the winter and early crop growth (GC, FR:R, DM, N, PAR, height), and was the most significant locus in a QTL analysis. We conclude that, within these environmental and system contexts, genes moderating development are likely to be more important in influencing early resource capture than using Rht8c as an alternative semi-dwarfing gene to Rht-D1b.

AB Aluminium (Al) toxicity is a major constraint to crop productivity in acidic soils. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed to identify the genetic basis of Al tolerance in the wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring'. A nutrient solution culture approach was undertaken with the root tolerance index (RTI) and hematoxylin staining method as parameters to assess the Al tolerance. Using a set of D genome introgression lines, a major Al tolerance QTL was located on chromosome arm 4DL, explaining 31% of the phenotypic variance present in the population. A doubled haploid population was used to map a second major Al tolerance QTL to chromosome arm 3BL. This major QTL (Qalt (CS) .ipk-3B) in 'Chinese Spring' accounted for 49% of the phenotypic variation. Linkage of this latter QTL to SSR markers opens the possibility to apply marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pyramiding of this new QTL to improve the Al tolerance of wheat cultivars in breeding programmes.

AB QTLs for quality traits of northern-style hand-made Chinese steamed bread (CSB) were mapped based on recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between two Chinese winter wheat varieties, Chuang 35050 and Shannong 483. We detected eight putative QTLs for eight quality traits on seven chromosomes, 213, 2D, 4A, 5B, 5D, 6B and 7B. The contributions of QTLs ranged from 9.88 to 64.87%. The additive effects of QTLs for color, elasticity, and stickiness were positive, with Chuan 35050 increasing the effects. Additive effects for volume, specific volume, appearance, smell, and total score were negative, with Shannong 483 increasing the effects. Two co-location QTLs were detected in the marker region Xgwm644-Xgwm193-Xgwm608b on chromosome 6B. The contributions of four QTLs for appearance, stickiness, smell and total score were very high (29.80-64.87%), indicating that these traits are controlled by major gene loci. The contribution of the smell QTL in Xissr25b-Xissr23b-Xwmc308-Xsrap7c on chromosome 4A was the highest (64.87%). We speculate that a major gene related to the smell or taste is located on chromosome 4A. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low-molecular weight glutenin subunits (LWM-GS) are important components of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) gluten, with important effects on end-use quality. The LMW-GS are encoded at Glu-3 loci (Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3. on the short arms of chromosomes 1A, 113 and 113), each of which exhibits extensive allelic variation. Each locus encodes numerous LMW-GS, some of which have similar electrophoretic mobilities, making it difficult to distinguish among Glu-3 loci. Alleles of the Glu-D3 locus of bread wheat are considered the most problematic to assign. To date, six Glu-D3 alleles, designated a, b, c, d, e and f have been reported. We report five previously undescribed alleles (g, h, i, j and k), and describe a method for characterizing them using a combination of SDS-PAGE and multiplexed PCR-based DNA markers. This method could be used for accurate identification of Glu-D3 alleles, permitting the estimation of the effects of these alleles on end-use quality and the selection of desirable alleles and allelic combinations in wheat breeding.

AB Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is the causal agent of stem rust disease in wheat. The rust fungus has caused devastating disease epidemics throughout history and is still posing a potential threat to wheat production in some regions of the world due to the appearance of new races. To develop microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for use in population genetics studies, a total of 60,579 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences (reads) generated from P. graminis f. sp. tritici were screened for tandemly repeated di- and tri-nucleotide units using a bioinformatics approach and 708 unisequences containing putative SSR loci with six or more repeat units were identified. Flanking primers were designed for 384 unique SSR loci, which mapped to different locations of the draft genome sequence of the fungus. Of the 384 primer pairs tested, 72 EST-SSR markers were eventually developed, which showed polymorphism among 19 isolates of P. graminis f. sp. tritici and 4 isolates of P. graminis f. sp. secalis evaluated. Thirty-two of the SSR loci were also evaluated in three other rust fungi (P. triticina, P. hordei, and P. coronata f. sp. hordei) for cross-species transferability. These SSR markers derived from ESTs will be useful for characterization of population structures and for gene mapping in P. graminis.

AB Fructans are fructose polymers synthesized from sucrose in the plant vacuole. They represent short- and long-term carbohydrate reserves and have been associated with abiotic stress tolerance in graminean species. We report the isolation and characterization of a putative sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) gene from a Patagonian grass species, Bromus pictus, tolerant to drought and cold temperatures. Structural and functional analyses of this gene were performed by Southern and Northern blot. Sugar content, quality and fructosyltransferase activity were studied using HPAEC-PAD (high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection), enzymatic and colorimetric assays. The putative 6-SFT gene had all the conserved motifs of fructosyl-transferase and showed 90 identity at the amino acid level with other 6-SFTs from winter cereals. Expression studies, and determination of sugar content and fructosyl-transferase activity were performed on five sections of the leaf. Bp6-SFT was expressed predominantly in leaf bases, where fructosyltransferase activity and fructan content are higher. Bp6-SFT expression and accumulation of fructans showed different patterns in the evaluated leaf sections during a 7d time course experiment under chilling treatment. The transcriptional pattern suggests that the B. pictus 6-SFT gene is highly expressed in basal leaf sections even under control temperate conditions, in contrast to previous reports in other graminean species. Low temperatures caused an increase in Bp6-SFT expression and fructan accumulation in leaf bases. This is the first study of the isolation and molecular characterization of a fructosyltransferase in a native species from the Patagonian region. Expression in heterologous systems will confirm the functionality, allowing future developments in generation of functional markers for assisted breeding or biotechnological applications.

AB Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation has been one of the methods used to generate transgenic plants in bell pepper. An alternate transformation method that avoids/minimizes tissue culture would be beneficial for the improvement of bell pepper due to its recalcitrant nature. In this report, transgenic bell pepper plants have been developed by a tissue-culture-independent A. tumefaciens-mediated in planta transformation procedure. In the present study, two open pollinated varieties viz., Arka Gaurav and Arka Mohini were used for transformation. Agrobacterium strain EHA105 harboring the binary vector pCAMBIA1301 that carries the genes for beta-glucuronidase (uid A) and hygromycin phosphotransferase II (hpt II) was used for transformation. GUS histochemical analysis of T(0) and T(1) plants at various stages of growth followed by molecular analysis using PCR, Southern analysis and RT-PCR allowed selection of transgenics. The method resulted in 17.8% and 11.4% of the To plants in Arka Gaurav and Arka Mohini being selected as chimeric and 35.0% and 29.7%, respectively, were identified as lstable transformants in the T(1) generation based on PCR analysis.

AB Improvement of flour colour is an important breeding objective for various wheat-based end-products. The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flour colour components and yellow pigment content (YPC), using 240 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the Chinese wheat cultivars PH82-2 and Neixiang 188. Field trials were performed in a Latinized alpha-lattice design in Anyang and Jiaozuo, Henan Province and Taian, Shandong, in the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 cropping seasons providing data for six environments. One hundred and eighty-eight polymorphic SSR markers, rye secalin marker Sec1, STS markers YP7A for a phytoene synthase gene (Psy-A1), and four glutenin subunit markers, were used to genotype the population and construct the linkage map for subsequent QTL analysis. Two major QTL were detected for YPC, associated with 1RS (1B.1R translocation) and the Psy-A1 (7A) gene, explaining 31.9% and 33.9% of the phenotypic variances, respectively. 1RS also had large influences on Fa*, Fb*, KJ, NL*and Nb*, and Psy-A1 genes showed large effects on Fa*, Fb*, Kj, Fci, NL*, Na* and Nb*, explaining from 4.5 to 26.1% and 4.3 to 35.9% of the phenotypic variances, respectively. In addition, QTL for flour colour parameters and yellow pigment content were also detected on chromosomes 1A and 4A, accounting for 1.5-4.1% of the phenotypic variance. The genetic effect of the 1B.1R translocation on flour colour parameters was also discussed.

AB Photoperiod response is of great importance for optimal adaptation of bread wheat cultivars to specific environments, and variation is commonly associated with allelic differences at the Ppd-D1 locus on chromosome 2D. A total of 926 Chinese wheat landraces and improved cultivars collected from nine wheat growing zones were tested for their genotypes at the Ppd-D1 locus using allele-specific markers. The average frequency of the photoperiod-insensitive Ppd-D1a allele was 66.0%, with the frequencies of 38.6 and 90.6% in landraces and improved cultivars, respectively. However, the Ppd-D1a allele was present in all improved cultivars released after 1970 except for spring wheats in high latitude northwestern China, and winter wheats in Gansu and Xinjiang. The presence of the Ppd-D1a allele in landraces and improved cultivars increased gradually from north to south, illustrating the relationship between photoperiod response and environment. Ppd-D1a in Chinese wheats is derived from three sources, Japanese landrace Akagomughi and Chinese landraces Mazhamai and Youzimai. The current information is important for understanding the broad adaptation of improved Chinese wheat cultivars.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum (Schwabe), is an important wheat disease. In addition to head blight, F. graminearum also causes Fusarium seedling blight (FSB) and produces the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in the grain. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the relationship between resistance of wheat lines to F. graminearum in the seedlings and spikes and (2) to determine whether the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FSB were the same as QTLs for FHB resistance and DON level reported for the same population previously (Somers et al. 2003). There was no relationship between FSB infection and FHB index or DON content across the population. A single QTL on chromosome 5B that controlled FSB resistance was identified in the population; the marker WMC75 explained 13.8% of the phenotypic variation for FSB. This value implies that there may be other QTL with minor effects present, but they were not detected in the analysis. Such a QTL on chromosome 5B was not reported previously among the QTLs associated with FHB resistance and DON level in this population. However, because of recombination, some lines in the present study have Fusarium resistance for both seedling and head blight simultaneously. For example, DH line HC 450 had the highest level of resistance to FSB and FHB and was among the ten lines with lowest DON content. This line is a good candidate to be used as a parent for future crosses in breeding for Fusarium seedling resistance, together with breeding for head blight resistance. This approach may be effective in increasing overall plant resistance to Fusarium.

AB Hard white wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a value-added product because of its processing advantages over red wheat; however, white wheat tends to be more susceptible to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with PHS tolerance, we developed a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population from the cross AC Domain (red seeded) x White-RL4137 (white seeded). A genetic map was constructed using microsatellite markers located on chromosome groups 3, 4, 5 and 6. A population of 174 DH lines was characterized for important aspects of PHS including sprouting index, germination index, Hagberg falling number and seed coat colour. A total of 11 QTLs were identified on group 3 chromosomes and on chromosome 5D. Seven QTLs associated with the PHS traits were found to be co-incident with seed coat colour on chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D. The 5D PHS QTL was notable because it is independent of seed coat colour.

   REGION
AB A major gene-rich region on the end of the long arm of Triticeae group 2 chromosomes exhibits high recombination frequencies, making it an attractive region for positional cloning. Traits known to be controlled by this region include chasmogamy/cleistogamy, frost tolerance at flowering, grain yield, head architecture, and resistance to Fusarium head blight and rusts. To assist these cloning efforts, we constructed detailed genetic maps of barley chromosome 2H, including 61 polymerase chain reaction markers. Colinearity with rice occurred in eight distinct blocks, including five blocks in the terminal gene-rich region. Alignment of rice sequences from the junctions of colinear chromosome segments provided no evidence for the involvement of long (> 2.5 kb) inverted repeats in generating inversions. However, reuse of some junction sequences in two or three separate evolutionary breakage/fusion events was implicated, suggesting the presence of fragile sites. Sequencing across 91 gene fragments totaling 107 kb from four barley genotypes revealed the highest single nucleotide substitution and insertion-deletion polymorphism levels in the terminal regions of the chromosome arms. The maps will assist in the isolation of genes from the chromosome 2L gene-rich region in barley and wheat by providing markers and accelerating the identification of the corresponding points in the rice genome sequence.

AB Genetic diversity in 20 elite blackgram (Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper) genotypes was studied using microsatellite and AFLP markers. Thirty-six microsatellite markers from azuki bean (Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi & Ohashi) were successfully amplified across the 20 blackgram genotypes and 33 microsatellite markers showed polymorphism. A total of 137 microsatellite alleles were generated with an average of 4.1 alleles per locus. The number of alleles ranged from two to nine and the polymorphic information content value for the microsatellite markers varied from 0.10 to 0.87 with an average of 0.49. Microsatellite markers were highly informative and a combination of only three microsatellite markers (CEDG264, CEDG173, and CEDG044) was sufficient to discriminate all 20 blackgram genotypes. In the case of AFLP, 11 primer pairs generated 324 polymorphic marker fragments. The polymorphic information content values for AFLP primer combinations ranged from 0.21 to 0.34 with an average of 0.29. Similarity measures and clustering analyses were made using microsatellite and AFLP data separately. The resulting dendrograms distributed the 20 blackgram genotypes into five main clusters. The dendrograms were comparable with each other with the Mantel test between the cophenetic matrices of microsatellite data and AFLP data showing moderate correlation (r = 0.64). The results of the principal components analysis were well congruent with the dendrograms. In the dendrograms as well as in the principal components analyses, genotype Trombay wild (Vigna mungo var. silvestris) was placed separately from rest of the genotypes. This study demonstrated that the azuki bean microsatellite markers are highly polymorphic and informative and can be successfully used for genome analysis in blackgram. Results indicate that sufficient variability is present in the blackgram genotypes and would be helpful in the selection of suitable parents for breeding purposes and gene mapping studies.

AB One Agropyron elongatum derived dominant seedling resistance gene (Lr24) and one recessive adult plant resistance (APR) gene (Lr48) for leaf rust resistance, were pyramided together employing marker assisted selection (MAS) with sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker SCS1302(607) tagged to the gene Lr24 and two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) mar flanking the gene Lr48, S3(450) and S336(775) in wheat. The RAPD marker S3(450), linked in repulsion phase amplified a 450 bp marker fragment corresponding to the recessive resistance allele and the other marker S336(775) linked in coupling phase amplified a 775 bp marker fragment corresponding to the dominant susceptibility allele of the Lr48 locus. Parental genotypes comprised of the near Isogenic line (NIL) of the most widely grown cultivar PBW343 possessing Lr24 and an Australian cultivar CSP44 possessing APR gene Lr48. Phenotyping was done after Inoculating with pathotype 77-5 of Puccinia triticina and integrated with MAS under controlled conditions of Phytotron (for F(1) and F(3) generations) and natural field conditions (for selection in F(2) and F(4) generations). Agronomic suitability of the marker positive plants was integrated for generating the F(3) families and selecting the F(4) subfamilies. MAS facilitated the identification of 26 F(4) subfamilies fixed for both the genes with desirable plant type from three F(3) families homozygous for dominant gene Lr24 selected from 38 F(2) single plants homozygous for APR Lr48. The selected F(4) subfamilies were furthered for seed bulking and yield performance in F(5) generation.

Evaluation of the BC(3)-F(5) along with their recurrent parents and controls carrying specific Lr and Sr genes under natural and artificial conditions indicated that conventionally improved newly constituted lines confer resistance to leaf rust, stem rust and powdery mildew in adult stage against the pathotypes prevailing in the Nilgirls. Some of these lines also displayed resistance to leaf rust pathotype 77-8 (253R 31) in adult stage. However, the improved lines, viz., C306*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1, HD2687*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1, MACS2496*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1, PBW226*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1, UP2338*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1 and UP262*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1 showed moderate susceptibility to 77-8. The leaf rust pathotype 77-8 was found avirulent on Lr26. The resistance in UP262 can be ascribed to Lr23 and some unknown gene(s) possessed by it. Since Lr19 is effective to all the pathotypes of leaf rust In India except 77-8, the differential response exhibited by BC(3)-F(5) lines against a mixture of prevailing races at Wellington and against a new pathotype 77-8 at New Delhi indicated unambiguously the presence of Lr19 in the introgressed lines. High degree of resistance to stem rust and powdery mildew In all the BC(3)-F(5) lines evidenced that these carry the genes Sr36 and Pm6. The conventional methodology proved successful in phenotype-based selection of resistance gene combinations In the absence of molecular markers. To ensure the correct identity of target genes, the BC(3)-F(5) lines (2 to 9) were tested with molecular markers SCS265, SCS253 and Gb linked to leaf rust resistance gene Lr19 and SSR stm773 for stem rust resistance gene Sr36. The presence of genetically associated genes was verified by the amplification of translocated DNA segment in most of the backcross lines. With the detection and testing with a new Lr19 virulence, host-pathogen interaction test response against leaf rust and the molecular test response did not correspond in HW2004*(3)/Cook*(6)/C80-1 because of presence of an additional segment of Lt24/Sr24. The availability of a combination of major genetically diverse resistance genes in adapted wheat cultivars would facilitate the strategic deployment to achieve enhanced durable resistance. Also these lines could be used as donor and supplement the molecular mapping and tagging of genes.

AB Insect biotypes are populations able to kill or injure crops with resistance genes and complicate pest management programs based on host plant resistance. Biotypes occur in Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a worldwide pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., and barley, Hordeum vulgare L., that was introduced into Mexico in 1980 and then spread into Texas by 1986. Five D. noxia biotypes were described in the United States and given the number designations 1 through 5. Of these, only Biotypes 1 and 2, which are nondamaging and damaging to Dn4-resistant wheat, respectively, are common and agriculturally important. Only a single clone of Biotypes 3, 4, and 5 were found in nature and now exist in the laboratory. The biotypes were found after 5 yr of the commercial planting of resistant wheat and their origin is unknown. To understand the genetic relatedness and origin of D. noxia biotypes in the United States, we used three molecular markers to assay for genetic variation within and between Biotypes 1 and 2, and for variation between Biotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. A single random amplified polymorphic DNA polymorphism was found in only two individuals. No DNA sequence variation in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene was found between 26 D. noxia clones. No variation was found at seven examined simple sequence repeat loci. Results suggest Biotype 2 originated from the extant population and does not represent a second introduction of a genetically divergent biotype.

AB Waxy protein (granule-bound starch synthase I) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of amylose in endosperm tissue. The amylose content of wheat flour plays a significant role in determining Japanese udon noodle quality. Most wheat cultivars suitable for producing udon noodles have a low amylose level due to a lack of Wx-B1 protein conditioned by null Wx-B1 alleles. It was previously determined that the entire coding region of the wheat Wx-B1 gene is deleted in the most common null allele. However, the extent and breakpoints of the deletion have not been established. In this study, the position of the 3' deletion breakpoint was refined by mapping with PCR-based markers. Using information from this analysis, a chromosome walk was initiated and the DNA sequence flanking the deletion breakpoints was obtained. The deletion included a 3,872 bp region downstream from the termination codon of Wx-B1 gene. Based on similarity with T. monococcum sequences, it was estimated that approximately 60 kb upstream of the Wx-B1 gene was also deleted. Using this sequence information, a codominant marker for the identification of the Wx-B1 null allele was developed. This marker can unambiguously identify heterozygous plants, which will accelerate the selection of partial waxy mutants carrying the Wx-B1 null allele.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., is an important foliar disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Pyramiding several major rust-resistance genes into one adapted cultivar is one strategy for obtaining more durable resistance. Molecular markers linked to these genes are essential tools for gene pyramiding. The rust-resistance gene Lr41 from T. tauschii has been introgressed into chromosome 2D of several wheat cultivars that are currently under commercial production. To discover molecular markers closely linked to Lr41, a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) of the hard winter wheat cultivar Century were developed through backcrossing. A population of 95 BC(3)F(2:6) NILs were evaluated for leaf rust resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages and analyzed with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers using bulked segregant analysis. Four markers closely linked to Lr41 were identified on chromosome 2DS; the closest marker, Xbarc124, was about 1 cM from Lr41. Physical mapping using Chinese Spring nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic genetic stocks confirmed that markers linked to Lr41 were on chromosome arm 2DS. Marker analysis in a diverse set of wheat germplasm indicated that primers BARC124, GWM210, and GDM35 amplified polymorphic bands between most resistant and susceptible accessions and can be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs.

AB DNA preparation is indispensable for genotyping by DNA polymorphism analysis, and that for a large number of plants is laborious. In the present study, a small leaf disk of rice, 1-2 mm in diameter, punched by a mini cork borer was found to be directly usable as a PCR template. DNA fragments < 300 bp were amplified efficiently. Leaf disks of 1-1.5 mm in diameter were better than those of 2 mm for a small volume of reaction mixture. Multiplex PCR was possible with four or eight primer pairs using the small leaf disk as a template. Leaf disks of Arabidopsis, Lotus, wheat, soybean, tomato, Chinese cabbage, and melon were also good PCR templates. This method for preparation of PCR templates, named the leaf-punch method, was applicable to SNP analysis of a large number of plants by dot-blot-SNP analysis.

AB We report on the identification of FHB (Fusarium head blight) resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) of the donor 'G93010' (Bussard/Ning8026) in the background of elite breeding material adapted to the central European climate. With a multiple interval mapping method, two major resistance QTL were identified. Qfhs.lfl-7BS/5BL and Qfhs.lfl-6BS reduced FHB severity individually by 30% and 24%. The combination of both QTL decreased disease severity most effectively by about one half. Qfhs.lfl-6BS is most likely identical to Fhb2, thus, the effectiveness of Fhb2 in central European breeding material has been validated. Qfhs.lfl-7BS/5BL overlapped with QTL for plant height and heading date. Nevertheless, the selection of lines combining a good FHB resistance level with an acceptable plant height was possible. As the donors of the QTL have probably not yet been utilized in European breeding material, we identified well-adapted lines of the mapping population as valuable donors for marker-assisted breeding programmes.

AB A new x-type HMW glutenin subunit, designated as 1Dx1.6(t) from Aegilops tauschii was identified and characterized by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. This subunit is located between 1Dx2 and 1Dx1.5(t) and possesses a molecular mass (M-r) of 88565.8 Da. Its complete coding sequence was amplified via allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR), and the amplified product was cloned and sequenced. The authenticity of the cloned 1Dx1.6(t) gene was confirmed by successful expression of its open reading frame in Escherichia coli. The molecular characterization of 1Dx1.6(t) gene showed that its coding region consisted of 2541 bp encoding a polypeptide of 845 amino acid residues. Sequence comparison to previously characterized 1Dx1.5(t) subunit which is related to good dough quality of bread wheat indicated that the 1Dx1.6(t) subunit displayed high homology, but possesses 14 residue substitutions and a nonapeptide insertion. A total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (1 per 212 bp) was identified in the 1Dx1.6(t) allele (11 in repetitive domain and 1 in the C-terminal domain), which could facilitate the design of AS-PCR markers.

AB Although the genetic regulation of recombination in allopolyploid species plays a pivotal role in evolution and plant breeding, it has received little recent attention, except in wheat (Triticum aestivum). PrBn is the main locus that determines the number of nonhomologous associations during meiosis of microspore cultured Brassica napus haploids (AC; 19 chromosomes). In this study, we examined the role played by PrBn in recombination. We generated two haploid 3 euploid populations using two B. napus haploids with differing PrBn (and interacting genes) activity. We analyzed molecular marker transmission in these two populations to compare genetic changes, which have arisen during meiosis. We found that cross-over number in these two genotypes was significantly different but that cross-overs between nonhomologous chromosomes showed roughly the same distribution pattern. We then examined genetic recombination along a pair of A chromosomes during meiosis of B. rapa 3 B. napus AAC and AACC hybrids that were produced with the same two B. napus genotypes. We observed significant genotypic variation in cross-over rates between the two AAC hybrids but no difference between the two AACC hybrids. Overall, our results show that PrBn changes the rate of recombination between nonhomologous chromosomes during meiosis of B. napus haploids and also affects homologous recombination with an effect that depends on plant karyotype.

TI Molecular Cytogenetic Characterization of a New T2BL center dot 1RS
   Wheat-Rye Chromosome Translocation Line Resistant to Stripe Rust and

DT Article
ID BREAD WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION; 1BL.1RS
AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes with rye (Secale cereale) 1RS chromosomal translocations are widely used in wheat breeding programs because 1RS carries genes for resistance to several diseases. However, some of the pathogens have evolved into new races that overcome the resistance due to extensive use of cultivars with the resistance genes from rye. Therefore, identification and deployment of new resistance sources with desirable agronomic characteristics are important and urgent. We have used winter rye cultivar German White as a source of genes for desirable traits in wheat improvement. A new genotype named WR04-32 was produced through hybridization and chromosome manipulation between common winter wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and German White. This genotype was highly resistant to a wide spectrum of the wheat stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) pathotypes prevalent in China. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result using EST-STS (expressed sequence tag-site tagged sequence) marker STS(WE126) specific to 1RS confirmed 1RS in WR04-32. and it was further proved to be a wheat-rye T2BL center dot 1RS translocation line using sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes pAs1 and pSc119.2 (or pHvG38). In addition to its resistance to stripe rust and powdery mildew, WR04-32 was genetically stable and had desirable agronomic traits, making it a desirable germplasm for wheat breeding.

AB The Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex) that consists of at least 11 phylogenetically distinct species contains important Fusarium head blight (FHB) pathogens of wheat and barley worldwide. We obtained members of the Fg complex by sampling from a 500-m(2) experimental wheat field in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan in two consecutive years and assessed them for species identity and trichothecene chemotype. Haplotype diversity was estimated by using 11 variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. In addition to these two samples (group 03W in 2003 and group 04W in 2004), pathogen populations from seed that was harvested in Fukuoka Prefecture and planted in the experimental field in 2002 (group 02WSC) and pathogen populations from seed that was harvested in Nagasaki Prefecture and planted in 2003 (group 03WSC) were analyzed for this study. Forty-six isolates were collected in each group. Most isolates from wheat heads were classified as F asiaticum; only four isolates were classified as F graminearum sensu stricto (s. str.). Out of a total of 183 Fg complex strains, 80 isolates (44%) were of the NIV type, while 103 isolates (56%), including all four F graminearum s. str. isolates, were of the 3ADON type. No 15ADON type isolate was detected in this study. Trichothecene chemotype compositions of 03W and 04W were nearly identical. High gene diversity of E asiaticum was observed in all groups. Based on the observed low level of fixation index (F-ST) and high level of effective number of migrants (Nm), distinctive population subdivision of F. asiaticum was not inferred among the four groups. These results suggest that FHB in the experimental wheat field in both 2003 and 2004 was caused by a genetically similar population, which prevails in Kumamoto, Fukuoka, and Nagasaki prefectures.

AB PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers are EST-PCR markers developed based on the orthologous gene conservation between rice and wheat, and on the intron polymorphisms among the three orthologous genes derived from the A, B and D genomes of wheat. We designed a total of 960 primer sets from wheat ESTs that showed high similarity with 951 single-copy rice genes. When genomic DNA of Chinese Spring wheat was used as a template, 872 primer sets amplified one to five distinct products. Out of these 872 PLUG markers, 531 were assigned to one or more chromosomes by nullisomic-tetrasomic analysis. For each wheat chromosome, the number of loci detected ranged from 32 for chromosome 6A to 73 for chromosome 7D, with an average of 48 loci per chromosome. Several novel synteny perturbations were identified using deletion bin-mapping of markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLUG markers can be used as probes to simultaneously identify BAC clones that contain homoeologous regions from all three genomes.

AB The wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr6, present in several wheat cultivars, confers a high level of resistance against a wide range of races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Resistance conferred by Sr6 is influenced by temperature, light intensity, and genetic background of the recipient genotype. Here, we report the identification and validation of molecular markers linked to Sr6 that can be used for the detection of this gene in wheat breeding programs. A mapping population of 136 F(2) plants and their F(2:3) families derived from a cross between near-isogenic lines, 'Chinese Spring' and ISr6-Ra, were screened for stem rust reaction in the seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) based on seedling tests was used to screen 418 SSR markers that covered the entire genome of wheat. Four markers, Xwmc453, Xcfd43, Xcfd77, and Xgwm484, were mapped within a chromosome region that spanned 9.7 cM from Sr6. The closest markers, Xwmc453 and Xcfd43, were linked to Sr6 at a distance of 1.1 and 1.5 cM, respectively. The markers Xwmc453 and Xcfd43 amplified Sr6-specific marker alleles that were diagnostic for Sr6 in a diverse set of 46 wheat accessions and breeding lines developed and/or collected in Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, and USA. These markers can now be used for marker-assisted selection of Sr6 and for pyramiding it with other stem rust resistance genes.

AB Despite chickpea being the third important grain legume, there is a limited availability of genomic resources, especially of the expressed sequence tag (EST)-based markers. In this study, we generated 822 chickpea ESTs from immature seeds as well as exploited 1,309 ESTs from the chickpea database, thus utilizing a total of 2,131 EST sequences for development of functional EST-SSR markers. Two hundred and forty-six simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were identified from which 183 primer pairs were designed and 60 validated as functional markers. Genetic diversity analysis across 30 chickpea accessions revealed ten markers to be polymorphic producing a total of 29 alleles and an observed heterozygosity average of 0.16 thereby exhibiting low levels of intra-specific polymorphism. However, the markers exhibited high cross-species transferability ranging from 68.3 to 96.6% across the six annual Cicer species and from 29.4 to 61.7% across the seven legume genera. Sequence analysis of size variant amplicons from various species revealed that size polymorphism was due to multiple events such as copy number variation, point mutations and insertions/deletions in the microsatellite repeat as well as in the flanking regions. Interestingly, a wide prevalence of crossability-group-specific sequence variations were observed among Cicer species that were phylogenetically informative. The neighbor joining dendrogram clearly separated the chickpea cultivars from the wild Cicer and validated the proximity of C. judaicum with C. pinnatifidum. Hence, this study for the first time provides an insight into the distribution of SSRs in the chickpea transcribed regions and also demonstrates the development and utilization of genic-SSRs. In addition to proving their suitability for genetic diversity analysis, their high rates of transferability also proved their potential for comparative genomic studies and for following gene introgressions and evolution in wild species, which constitute the valuable secondary genepool in chickpea.

AB Wheat cultivar Express has durable, high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici). To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, Express was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS). A mapping population of 146 F(5) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed using single-seed descent. The RILs were evaluated at two sites near Pullman in eastern Washington and one site near Mount Vernon in western Washington in 2005, and were evaluated near Pullman in 2006 under natural stripe rust infection of predominant races virulent on seedlings of Express. Infection type (IT) and disease severity (DS) were recorded three times for each line during each growing season. The DS data were used to calculate relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC) values. Both IT and rAUDPC data showed continuous distributions, indicating that the Express HTAP resistance was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to map the HTAP resistance QTL. Three QTL were detected with significant additive effects, explaining 49.5-69.6% of the phenotypic variation for rAUDPC. Two of the QTL explained 30.8-42.7% of the phenotypic variation for IT. The three QTL were mapped to wheat chromosomes 6AS, 3BL and 1BL, and were designated as QYrex.wgp-6AS, QYrex.wgp-3BL and QYrex.wgp-1BL, respectively. QYrex.wgp-6AS and QYrex.wgp-3BL, which had higher effects than QYrex.wgp-1BL, were different from previously reported QTL/genes for adult-plant resistance. Markers Xgwm334-Xwgp56 and Xgwm299-Xwgp66 flanking the two major QTL were highly polymorphic in various wheat genotypes, suggesting that these markers are useful in marker-assisted selection.

AB A strategy combining single backcrossing with selected bulk breeding has been successfully used in wheat improvement at CIMMYT to introgress rust resistant genes from donor parents to elite adapted cultivars. In this research, the efficiency of this breeding strategy was compared to other crossing and selection strategies through computer simulation. Results indicated this breeding strategy has advantages in retaining or improving the adaptation of the recurrent parents, and at the same time transferring most of the desired donor genes in a wide range of scenarios. Two rounds of backcrossing have advantages when the adaptation of donor parents is much poorer than that of the adapted parents, but the advantage of three rounds of backcrossing over two rounds is minimal. We recommend using the single backcrossing breeding strategy (SBBS) when three conditions are met: (1) multiple genes govern the phenotypic traits to be transferred from donor parents to adapted parents, (2) the donor parents have some favorable genes that may contribute to the improvement of adaptation in the recipient parents, and (3) conventional phenotypic selection is being applied, or individual genotypes cannot be precisely identified. We envisage that all three conditions commonly exist in modern breeding programs, and therefore believe that SBBS could be applied widely. However, we do not exclude the use of repeated backcrossing if the transferred genes can be precisely identified by closely linked molecular markers, and the donor parents have extremely poor adaptation.

AB Amylose and amylopectin are the two polysaccharides that constitute starch in bread wheat and the enzyme GBSSI (Granule-bound starch synthase I), also known as waxy protein, is responsible for amylose synthesis in storage tissues. Decrease of the amylose content in starch has been associated with the lack of waxy protein(s). In this work, different sets of PCR markers were used to characterize the genetic variability of waxy loci from 103 Argentinean bread wheat cultivars. For the Wx-A1 locus, Wx-A1a and a novel molecular allele designed Wx-A1g were detected. Wx-B1 locus showed three alleles (Wx-B1a, Wx-B1b, Wx-B1e), and Wx-D1 locus showed only the Wx-D1a allele. Novel single-locus allele specific markers for Wx-A1b, Wx-B1b and Wx-D1b null alleles were also described. To our best knowledge this is the first study focused to characterize the genetic variability for waxy genes in bread wheat cultivars from South America.

AB Background: Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seed development is a highly regulated process with fine-tuned interaction of various tissues controlling distinct physiological events during prestorage, storage and dessication phase. As potential regulators involved within this process we studied 172 transcription factors and 204 kinases for their expression behaviour and anchored a subset of them to the barley linkage map to promote marker-assisted studies on barley grains.
   Results: By a hierachical clustering of the expression profiles of 376 potential regulatory genes expressed in 37 different tissues, we found 50 regulators preferentially expressed in one of the three grain tissue fractions pericarp, endosperm and embryo during seed development. In addition, 27 regulators found to be expressed during both seed development and germination and 32 additional regulators are characteristically expressed in multiple tissues undergoing cell differentiation events during barley plant ontogeny. Another 96 regulators were, beside in the developing seed, ubiquitously expressed among all tissues of germinating seedlings as well as in reproductive tissues. SNP-marker development for those regulators resulted in anchoring 61 markers on the genetic linkage map of barley and the chromosomal assignment of another 12 loci by using wheat-barley addition lines. The SNP frequency ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 SNP/kb in the parents of the various mapping populations and was 2.3 SNP/kb over all eight lines tested. Exploration of macrosynteny to rice revealed that the chromosomal orders of the mapped putative regulatory factors were predominantly conserved during evolution.
   Conclusion: We identified expression patterns of major transcription factors and signaling related genes expressed during barley ontogeny and further assigned possible functions based on likely orthologs functionally well characterized in model plant species. The combined linkage map and reference expression map of regulators defined in the present study offers the possibility of further directed research of the functional role of regulators during seed development in barley.

AB Genetic diversity in a collection of 70 bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes was studied using 73 microsatellite [simple sequence repeat (SSR)] loci evenly spaced on wheat chromosomes. A total of 592 alleles with an average of 8.53 allele/locus were detected, of which 185 (31.25%) occurred only in a specific group of genotypes. A set of SSR markers consisted of 22 loci with polymorphic information content values of 0.80 or higher were selected for rapid fingerprinting of many genotypes. Average of gene diversity was 0.74 +/- 0.017, and significant difference between observed and maximum theoretical values of gene diversity in the analysed SSR loci was obtained using a paired t-test. Genetic distance-based clustering methods including unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average and neighbour joining (NJ) were used for grouping of genotypes. The resulted dendrogram based on NJ and number of differences coefficient hinted of the existence of three groups. This grouping was in agreement with the pedigree information and confirmed by high within-group bootstrap value. A comparatively higher genetic diversity in the studied wheat collection as revealed by presence of high allelic diversity and large number of specific alleles could be utilised in development of new cultivars with desired characteristics.

AB The aim of resistance breeding is to transfer naturally occurring genes into major crops in order to improve their resistance to biotic and abiotic stress factors. In recent years a complete information system has been elaborated in Martonvasar, which amalgamates breeding and IT knowledge and is continually revised. The use of methods based on molecular breeding and the transgenic technique have made it necessary to create new types of databases to record information on genes, markers and transformation vectors. In order to facilitate the use of the data by breeders, new software also had to be designed for the following functions: (1) to identify useful resistance genes in genomic databases, (2) to identify and store markers suitable for the marker-assisted selection of basic genetic materials, (3) to provide real-time information to breeders (at the required time for the required search parameters) to facilitate the choice of crossing partners, (4) to test the ability to monitor transformation experiments, and (5) to make these experiments compatible with conventional breeding (crossing) programmes.

AB A wheat/barley translocation line was previously developed in Martonvasar from the Mv9kr1 x Igri hybrid and was identified as a 5HS.7D translocation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 5H-specific barley SSR markers. The aim of the present study was to characterize the rearranged wheat chromosome and to identify the 7D chromosome segment eliminated by the translocated 5HS segment using 7D-specific SSR markers. The elimination of the 7DS terminal region was proved by three of the twenty-four tested markers. The breakpoint of the 5HS. 7DS translocation was considered to be closer to the telomere than the breakpoint of known deletion lines, which provides a new physical landmark for future deletion mapping studies. The fine mapping of 7D makes it possible to localize agronomically useful genes to the precise chromosomal region of the eliminated 7DS segment, opening up the possibility of marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning.

AB Spontaneous wheat-barley translocation chromosomes were detected by genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) in the progenies of wheat/barley addition lines produced from the wheat cultivar Asakaze komugi and the Ukrainan six-rowed barley cultivar Manas. The homozygous translocation line was selected from a heterozygous translocation line with the help of molecular markers and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using repetitive DNA probes. The wheat chromosome arm involved in the translocation was identified by FISH as 4BS. The barley chromosome segment could not be unequivocally determined with the hybridisation of the repetitive DNA sequences used in the present work (Afa family, pSc119.2, pTa71). The microsatellite marker analysis revealed the presence of an almost complete 7HL chromosome arm, but the centromeric region of 7HL was missing from this translocation line. The rearranged chromosome, identified as 4BS. 7HL with a centromeric deletion of 7HL, represents a unique genetic material which can be used for the physical mapping of genes or genetic markers within 7HL. As the barley chromosome 7H is considered to be the most important chromosome for drought tolerance, the translocation line will make it possible to reveal the effect of the abiotic stress-related genes situated on the incorporated 7HL segment in the genetic background of wheat.

AB Knowledge of the genetic diversity existing in previously released hard red winter wheat (HRWW, Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in the Great Plains region, United States, is essential for effective utilisation of these genetic resources in the various HRWW breeding programs. To ascertain a measure of the genetic diversity of the existing US HRWW, 60 cultivars were analysed with 62 microsatellite markers distributed throughout the wheat genome. Marker data were subjected to distance-based analysis and analysis of molecular variances. In total, 341 polymorphic alleles were scored with a range of 2-12 alleles per locus. Genetic diversity gradually increased in cultivars released after the 1970s. Cultivars released in the 1990s had the highest allelic richness (4.79), gene diversity (0.60), and polymorphic information content (0.56). Levels of genetic diversity were similar between the major HRWW breeding programs. Cluster analysis resulted in eight clusters. Cluster grouping gave close matches with pedigrees and with regional distribution of the cultivars. Using decadal information, cultivars released from 1900-1969 were grouped into one cluster, cultivars from 1990-2005 were grouped into a separate cluster, whereas cultivars from the 1980s did not group with any other decades. Analysis of molecular variance revealed a significant variation among the clusters, signifying that a true genetic variation existed among the clusters. The higher proportion of genetic variation explained by cultivars within clusters compared with among clusters indicates greater genetic diversity among cultivars within clusters. Our results indicate that genetic diversity of Great Plains HRWW cultivars has increased in the past century, and the trend is continuing.
