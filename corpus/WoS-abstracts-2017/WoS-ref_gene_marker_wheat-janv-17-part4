AB Fusarium head blight, caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, is the most important wheat disease in Canada causing both grain yield and quality losses. Selection for resistance to Fusarium head blight in breeding programs has been difficult because of the complex inheritance of resistance and the environmental effect on disease development and expression. The present study was conducted to examine microsatellite markers associated with resistance to Fusarium head blight and evaluate the effectiveness of these microsatellite markers in selecting for resistance to Fusarium head blight in two doubled-haploid populations segregating for Sumai 3-derived resistance genes. Both doubled-haploid populations were evaluated for resistance to Fusarium head blight by inoculation with F. graminearum in the greenhouse. Eight microsatellite markers from chromosomes 3BS, 6B and 5AL were applied to both doubled-haploid populations. The most significant microsatellite markers were found on the short arm of chromosome 3B, explaining 12% and 36% of phenotypic variation for resistance in the DH181/AC Foremost and AC Foremost/93FHB 21 doubled-haploid populations, respectively. Another important microsatellite marker, gwm644 on 6B, explained 21 % of the phenotypic variation for resistance to Fusarium head blight in the DH181/AC Foremost doubled-haploid population. There was a general lack of marker polymorphism on 5AL for the parents used in this study. Microsatellite markers on chromosome 3BS in addition to microsatellite markers on 6B have the potential for accelerating the development of wheat cultivars with improved Fusarium head blight resistance through the use of marker-assisted selection.

AB Recently, five novel fluorescent proteins have been isolated from non-bioluminescent species of reef-coral organisms and have been made available through ClonTech. They are AmCyan, AsRed, DsRed, ZsGreen and ZsYellow. These proteins are valuable as reporters for transformation because they do not require a substrate or external co-factor to emit fluorescence and can be tested in vivo without destruction of the tissue under study. We have evaluated them in a large range of plants, both monocots and dicots, and our results indicate that they are valuable reporting tools for transformation in a wide variety of crops. We report here their successful expression in wheat, maize, barley, rice, banana, onion, soybean, cotton, tobacco, potato and tomato. Transient expression could be observed as early as 24 h after DNA delivery in some cases, allowing for very clear visualization of individually transformed cells. Stable transgenic events were generated, using mannose, kanamycin or hygromycin selection. Transgenic plants were phenotypically normal, showing a wide range of fluorescence levels, and were fertile. Expression of AmCyan, ZsGreen and AsRed was visible in maize T1 seeds, allowing visual segregation to more than 99% accuracy. The excitation and emission wavelengths of some of these proteins are significantly different; the difference is enough for the simultaneous visualization of cells transformed with more than one of the fluorescent proteins. These proteins will become useful tools for transformation optimization and other studies. The wide variety of plants successfully tested demonstrates that these proteins will potentially find broad use in plant biology.

AB Colinearity in gene content and order between rice and closely related grass species has emerged as a powerful tool for gene identification. Using a comparative genetics approach, we have identified the rice genomic region syntenous to the region deleted in the wheat chromosome pairing mutant ph2a, with a view to identifying genes at the Ph2 locus that control meiotic processes. Utilising markers known to reside within the region deleted in ph2a, and data from wheat, barley and rice genetic maps, markers delimiting the region deleted on wheat chromosome 3DS in the ph2a mutant were used to locate the syntenous region on the short arm of rice chromosome 1. A contig of rice genomic sequence was identified from publicly available sequence information and used in BLAST searches to identify wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) exhibiting significant similarity. Southern analysis using a subset of identified wheat ESTs confirmed a syntenous relationship between the rice and wheat genomic regions and defined precisely the extent of the deleted segment in the ph2a mutant. A 6.58-Mb rice contig generated from 60 overlapping rice chromosome 1 P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones spanning the syntenous rice region has enabled identification of 218 wheat ESTs putatively located in the region deleted in ph2a. What seems to be a terminal deletion on chromosome 3DS is estimated to be 80 Mb in length. Putative candidate genes that may contribute to the altered meiotic phenotype of ph2a are discussed.

AB Septoria tritici blotch, caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola, is a serious foliar disease of wheat worldwide. Qualitative, race-specific resistance sources have been identified and utilized for resistant cultivar development. However, septoria tritici blotch resistant varieties have succumbed to changes in virulence of M. graminicola on at least three continents. The use of resistance gene pyramids may slow or prevent the breakdown of resistance. A clear understanding of the genetics of resistance and the identification of linked PCR-based markers will facilitate the recovery of wheat lines carrying multiple septoria tritici blotch resistance genes. The resistance gene in ST6 to isolate MG2 of M. graminicola was mapped with microsatellite markers in two populations, ST6/Erik and ST6/Katepwa. Bulk segregant analysis identified a marker on chromosome 4AL putatively linked to the resistance gene. A large linkage group was identified in each population using additional microsatellite markers mapping to chromosome 4AL. The resistance gene in ST6 mapped to the distal end of chromosome 4AL in each mapping population and was designated Stb7. Three of the microsatellite loci, Xwmc313, Xwmc219 and Xgwm160, mapped within 3.5 cM of Stb7; however, none flanked Stb7. Xwmc313 was the closest and mapped 0.3 and 0.5 cM from Stb7 in the crosses ST6/Katepwa and ST6/Erik, respectively. WMC313 will be very useful for marker-assisted selection of Stb7 in Canadian breeding programs because the ST6 allele of Xwmc313 was not identified in any of the Canadian common wheat cultivars tested.

AB Stagonospora nodorum is the causal agent of the Stagonospora glume blotch disease in hexaploid wheat. The Swiss winter bread wheat cv. 'Arina' has a highly effective, durable and quantitative glume blotch resistance. We studied 240 single seed descent (SSD)-derived lines of an 'Arina x Forno' F-5:7 population to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for glume blotch resistance under natural infestation. Using composite interval mapping (CIM) and LOD>4.5, we detected two chromosomal regions on chromosome arms 3BS and 4BL which were specifically associated with glume blotch resistance. These identified QTLs were designated QSng.sfr-3BS and QSng.sfr-4BL, respectively. QSng.sfr-3BS peaked at the locus Xgwm389 in the telomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 3B and explained 31.2% of the observed phenotypic variance for the resistance within the population. The responsible QSng.sfr-3BS allele originated from the resistant parent 'Arina'. The QTL QSng.sfr-4BL (19.1%) mapped to chromosome arm 4BL ('Forno' allele) very close to two known genes, TaMlo and a catalase (Cat). Both QTL alleles combined could enhance the resistance level by about 50%. Additionally, they showed significant epistatic effects (4.4%). We found PCR-based microsatellite markers closely linked to QSng.sfr-3BS (gwm389) and QSng.sfr-4BL (gwm251) which make marker-assisted selection (MAS) for Stagonospora glume blotch resistance feasible. We also found one resistance QTL, QSng.sfr-5BL, on the long arm of chromosome 5B which overlapped with QTLs for plant height as well as heading time.

AB Three rye-specific repeated sequences, pSc10C, pSc20H and R173-1, were used to design sequence-specific anchored primers. These primers and 16 restriction site-specific adaptor primers were used in all possible combinations to establish sequence-specific amplified polymorphic (SSAP) markers for the 1RS chromosome arm of rye in a wheat background. Thirty 1RS-specific SSAP markers were detected in 19 primer combinations. Along with six markers localised previously on 1RS, 26 of the SSAP markers were mapped genetically in wheat genotypes carrying recombinant 1BL.1RS translocations. A clear decrease in recombination frequency from distal to proximal regions was observed. Wheat-rye addition lines for the 1R chromosome with different-sized deletions of the short arm were used to physically localise these markers. Physical mapping suggested an even distribution of the SSAP markers along the total length of the 1RS chromosome arm.

AB The Russian wheat aphid is a significant pest problem in wheat and barley in North America. Genetic resistance in wheat is the most effective and economical means to control the damage caused by the aphid. Dn7 is a rye gene located on chromosome 1RS that confers resistance to the Russian wheat aphid. The gene was previously transferred from rye into a wheat background via a 1RS/1BL translocation. This study was conducted to genetically map Dn7 and to characterize the type of resistance the gene confers. The resistant line '94M370' was crossed with a susceptible wheat cultivar that also contains a pair of 1RS/1BL translocation chromosomes. The F-2 progeny from this cross segregated for resistance in a ratio of 3 resistant: 1 susceptible, indicating a single dominant gene. One-hundred and eleven RFLP markers previously mapped on wheat chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D, barley chromosome 1H and rye chromosome 1R, were used to screen the parents for polymorphism. A genetic map containing six markers linked to Dn7, encompassing 28.2 cM, was constructed. The markers flanking Dn7 were Xbcd1434 and XksuD14, which mapped 1.4 cM and 7.4 cM from Dn7, respectively. Dn7 confers antixenosis, and provides a higher level of resistance than that provided by Dn4. The applications of Dn7 and the linked markers in wheat breeding are discussed.

AB A thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) wheat line (Triticum aestivum L.) BNY-S was obtained from the spontaneous mutant of BNY-F. Its fertility was decided by the temperature during the differentiation stage of the spikelets. BNY-S was completely sterile when the temperature was lower than 10degreesC during the differentiation stage of the spikelets, but fertile when the temperature was higher than 10degreesC. Genetic analysis indicated that the sterility of BNY-S was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was named as wtms1. An F-2 population, consisting of 3,000 individuals from the cross between BNY-S and Lankao 52-24, was used for genetic analysis and statistical analysis of the TGMS and, out of them, 158 sterile and 93 fertile extremes were present for molecular tagging and mapping of the wtms1 gene. SSR (simple sequence repeat) and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) techniques combined with BSA (bulked segregant analysis) were used to screen markers linked to the target gene. As a result, wtms1 was preliminarily mapped on chromosome 2B according to SSR analysis. In AFLP analysis, 14 polymorphic AFLP loci were identified with a linkage relation to the wtms1 gene. Then linkage analysis using the F2 population showed that three of them, E: AAG/M: CTA(163), E: AGG/M: CTC220 and E: ACA/M: CTA(160), were linked to the wtms1 gene relatively close to a genetic distance of 6.9 cM, 6.9 cM and 13.9 cM, respectively. Finally, the wtms1 gene was mapped between the SSR marker Xgwm 374 and the AFLP marker E: AAG/M: CTA(163) with the distance of 4.8 cM and 6.9 cM, respectively. A partial linkage map was constructed according the SSR and AFLP data.

AB High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are important determinants of wheat dough quality as they confer visco-elastic properties to the dough required for mixing and baking performance. With this important role, the HMW-GS alleles are key markers in breeding programs. In this work, we present the use of a PCR marker initially designed to discriminate Glul Bx7 and Glul Bx17 HMW-GS. It was discovered that this marker also differentiated two alleles, originally both scored as Glu1 Bx7, present in the wheat lines CD87 and Katepwa respectively, by a size polymorphism of 18 bp. The marker was scored across a segregating doubled-haploid (DH) population (CD87 x Katepwa) containing 156 individual lines and grown at two sites. Within this population, the marker differentiated lines showing the over-expression of the Gin 1130 subunit (indicated by the larger PCR fragment), derived from the CD87 parent, relative to lines showing the normal expression of the Glul 130 subunit, derived from the Katepwa parent. DNA sequence analysis showed that the observed size polymorphism was due to an 18 bp insertion/deletion event at the C-terminal end of the central repetitive domain of the Glul Bx 7 coding sequence, which resulted in an extra copy of the hexapeptide sequence QPGQGQ in the deduced amino-acid sequence of Bx7 from CD87. When the DH population was analysed using this novel Bx7 PCR marker, SDS PAGE and RP HPLC, there was perfect correlation between the 130 PCR marker results and the expression level of Bx7. This differentiation of the population was confirmed by both SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The functional significance of this marker was assessed by measuring key dough properties of the 156 DH lines. A strong association was shown between lines with an over expression of 130 and high dough strength. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that there was an additional impact of Glu-D1 alleles on dough properties, with lines containing both over-expressed Bx7 and GluD1 5+10 having the highest levels of dough strength. However, there was no statistically significant epistatic interaction between Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 loci.

AB A major QTL for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, Qfhs.ndsu-3BS, has been identified and verified by several research groups. The objective of this study was to increase the marker density in this QTL region using STS (sequence-tagged site) markers developed from wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) near Qlhs.ndsu3BS. Because wheat chromosome 3BS and rice chromosome IS are syntenous, the sequences of PI-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) and (or) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones covering the sub-distal portion of rice chromosome IS were used as queries for a BLASTn search to identify wheat ESTs most likely near Qfhs.ndsu-3BS. Sixty-eight out of 79 STS primer pairs designed from wheat ESTs amplified PCR products from the genomic DNA of Triticum aestivum 'Chinese Spring'. Twenty-eight STS markers were localized on chromosome 3BS by aneuploid analysis. Six out of the nine STS markers that could be mapped in the T aestivum, 'Sumai 3'/T aestivum 'Stoa' population had higher R-2 and LOD values for this QTL than the most significant marker reported previously. Therefore, leveraging genome sequence information available in rice for wheat genetics is an effective strategy to develop DNA markers for Qfhs.ndsu-3BS, and this strategy may have broad applications for targeted mapping of other traits in cereal crops.

AB A BAC library of hexaploid wheat was constructed using the spring wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum L. 'Glenlea'. Fresh shoot tissue from 7- to 10-day-old seedlings was used to obtain HMW DNA. The library was constructed using the HindIII site of pIndigoBAC-5 and the BamHI site of plndigoBAC-5 and pECBAC1. A total of 12 ligations were used to construct the entire library, which contains over 650 000 clones. Ninety-six percent of the clones had inserts. The insert size ranged from 5 to 189 kb with an average of 79 kb. The entire library was gridded onto 24 high-density filters using a 5 x 5 array. A subset of these membranes was hybridized with two intergenic chloroplast probes and the percentage of clones containing chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) was calculated to be 2.2%. The genome coverage was estimated to be 3.1 x haploid genome equivalents, giving a 95.3% probability of identifying a clone corresponding to any wheat DNA sequence. BAC pools were constructed and screened using markers targeting the Glu-B1 locus (M), the hardness loci (5AS, 5BS, 5DS), the leaf rust resistance locus Lr1 (5DL), and the major fusarium head blight QTL locus located on 3BS. These markers were either locus-specific amplicons or microsatellites. A total of 49 BAC clones were identified for 14 markers giving an average of 3.5 clones/marker, thereby corroborating the estimated 3.1x genome coverage. An example using the gene encoding the HMW glutenin Bx7 is illustrated.

AB Leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.) occurs annually in most wheat-growing areas of the world. Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Z.-W. Liu & R.-C. Wang has provided several leaf rust resistance genes to protect wheat from this fungal disease. Three chromosome substitution lines, Ji806, Ji807, and Ji859, and two chromosome addition lines, Ji791 and Ji924, with a winter growing habit were developed from crosses between wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ern Thell.) and the wheat - Th. ponticum partial amphiploid line 693. These lines were resistant to leaf rust isolates from China. Sequence-tagged site (STS) analysis with the J09-STS marker, which is linked to the gene Lr24, revealed that the partial amphiploid line 693 and all of the substitution and addition lines carried gene Lr24. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis was carried out on chromosome preparations using total genomic DNA from Pseudoroegneria strigosa (M. Bieb) A. Love (St genome, 2n = 14) as a probe in the presence of total genomic DNA from T aestivum 'Chinese Spring' wheat (ABD genomes, 2n = 42). The GISH analysis demonstrated that these lines had a pair of chromosomes displaying the typical pattern of a J(s) genome chromosome. This indicates that the chromosome that carries gene Lr24 belonged to the Js genome of Th. ponticum. In addition to 40 wheat chromosomes, eight J(s) and eight J genome chromosomes were also differentiated by GISH in the partial amphiploid line 693. Since most sources of Lr24 have a red grain color, the white-colored seeds in all of these substitution and addition lines, together with high protein content in some of the lines, make them very useful as a donor source for winter wheat breeding programs.

AB Over 85Mb publicly available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from four agronomically important crops were used to search for the types and frequencies of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with motif length of 1-6bp. The frequency of EST-SSRs was one in 11.81kb in rice, 17.42kb in wheat, 23.80kb in soybean, and 28.32kb in maize, respectively. Trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant SSR types with up to 47 trinucleotide repeat units in 100kb ESTs. Compared with dicots, monocots contained GC-rich tri- and hexa-motifs, especially rice where 23.6 CCG motif occurred in 100kb ESTs. 597 EST-SSR primer pairs were designed for wheat, of which, 478 primer pairs had successful PCR amplifications. The percentage of polymorphism was up to 41.8% among wheat varieties, that could be used to construct a transcriptional map of wheat. Cross-species amplification was detected. Among the 478 functional primers from wheat, 255 EST-SSRs amplified fragments in rice, maize and soybean way, indicating high degree of transferability between species, that facilitate comparative mapping and homologous gene cloning.

AB The economic value of wheat grain is determined by the kernel morphology which is an important parameter for manufacturing different food products requiring specific grain characteristics. Although kernel size and shape have emerged as important breeding objectives, not much information is available about the number or location of associated gene(s)/quantitative trait loci. In the present study, a recombinant inbred line population of 106 plants (F-7) was phenotyped for four traits, namely kernel length, width, weight and factor form density (FFD) and genotyped with different polymerase chain reaction-based markers. Transgressive segregants were observed for all the traits and genetic correlation studies showed positive correlations between the majority of the traits. The number of markers associated with each trait ranged from two to nine and the phenotypic contribution by an individual marker ranged from 3.3 to 16.6%. Many of the markers showed linkage to more than one trait. Strategies for improving the wheat grain quality traits and the utility of such markers in marker-assisted selection (MAS) efforts are discussed.

AB For ryegrass and many forage crops, characterization of varieties is often difficult for two reasons: few of discriminant morphological traits and a great within-varieties variation. Futhermore, few molecular markers are publicly accessible. In this paper we describe two approaches for the development of 42 sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers. Firstly, 14 STS markers were developed from Lolium sequences found in data bases. Secondly, 28 STS markers were developed from sequences found in related species of Gramineae. Out of 42 STS markers developed, 85.8% yielded successfull amplification and 62% revealed a high level of polymorphism with an average of five alleles per locus. The analysis of amplicons reveals a high STS marker specificity, a high conservation in gene structure and a strong intron sequence homology between allelic forms. Moreover, the majority of the STS markers can be considered as 'universal markers' because 81% of these STS markers amplified successfully across 20 related grass species. These results permit us to consider the use of these markers in synteny studies.

AB Rye is extremely recalcitrant to tissue culture and genetic transformation. We describe the efficient and reproducible production of stably expressing transgenic rye plants after biolistic gene transfer to callus tissue derived from immature embryos. Key factors in the production of transgenic rye plants include the identification of biolistic gene transfer parameters and a selection protocol, which does not affect its regeneration ability. The bar gene was used as a selectable marker and selection was performed by spraying the regenerated shoots with 0.05% Basta solution without any previous selection of tissue cultures. Based on Southern blot analysis, a total of 21 transgenic rye plants with independent transgene integration patterns were produced. A low transgene copy number was observed in most transgenic plants and 40% of the plants had a single transgene copy insert. The high frequency of single transgene copy inserts might be a consequence of the selection system, which is based on the identification of stably expressing transgenic plantlets rather than stably expressing tissue cultures. All transgenic rye lines with single transgene inserts showed stable transgene expression in sexual progenies, but indications of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing were observed in few transgenic lines with multiple transgene inserts. Tissue culture-based selection was not necessary for the generation of transgenic rye. The identification of 17 transgenic rye plants without using any selectable marker gene by PCR amplification of transgene sequences is also demonstrated. Instant generation of selectable marker-free transgenic rye avoids a negative impact of selective agents on the transgenic tissue cultures, responds to public concerns on the safety of selectable markers and will support multiple transformation cycles for transgene pyramiding.

AB Kernel color and grain protein concentration (GPC) are two of the most important attributes of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grain intended for use in malting and brewing. Grain with protein levels that are too low or high or that have dark kernel color, which may result from the disease complex of kernel discoloration (KD), is unacceptable for the malting and brewing industries. The purpose of this study was to use molecular markers to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for KD and GPC in two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. One population was created by means of the high GPC and KD resistant cultivar Chevron. The other population was created from a KD resistant cultivar MNBrite that was derived from Chevron through eight generations of crossing and selection for bright kernels. The traits KD and GPC were evaluated in four and three environments, respectively, using the Chevron population and six environments using the MNBrite population. GPC and KD score were negatively correlated in both populations. A revised genetic map for the Chevron/M69 population, with an additional 45 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, was used to identify nine QTLs associated with KD on chromosomes 1(7H), 2(2H), 4(4H), 6(6H), and 7(5H), including two major QTLs on chromosome 6(6H). A single QTL for GPC identified in the Chevron mapping population, accounting for over 55% of the phenotypic variation, was located on chromosome 6(6H) and was coincident with one of the two major QTLs for KD. In this region, the Chevron allele increased GPC and decreased KD score. In the MNBrite mapping population, the same region of chromosome 6(6H) was mapped with SSR markers, and QTL analysis verified that this region was associated with both KD and GPC, indicating that MNBrite inherited this region of chromosome 6(6H) from Chevron. The results of this study suggest that if GPC and KD are controlled by tightly linked genes, then it should be possible to use SSR markers to identify recombinants in this region of chromosome 6(6H) and break the linkage to allow selection for KD resistance without high GPC. Alternatively, if GPC and KD are conditioned by the same gene, then it should be possible to select for KD resistance from Chevron by means of SSR markers and to use phenotypic selection to introgress other genes to reduce GPC to acceptable levels.

AB Rust resistance genes Lr37, Sr,38, and Yr17 are located within a segment of Triticum ventricosum (Tausch) Cess. chromosome 2NS translocated to the short arm of bread wheat chromosome 2AS. Characterization of this chromosome segment by 13 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers indicated that the 2NS translocation replaced approximately half of the short arm of chromosome 2A (distal 25-38 centimorgans, cM). The objective of this study was to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on RFLP marker eMWG682 to facilitate the transfer of this cluster of rust resistance genes into commercial wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars. DNA sequence was obtained from the A-, B-, D-, and N-alleles of cMWG682 and was used to design N-allele specific primers. The 2NS fragment amplified by PCR primers cosegregated with the presence of the RFLP-2NS band in all backcross populations. A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) was used to develop a marker for the 2A-allele. This marker can be used to differentiate homozygous and heterozygous plants carrying the 2NS translocation in the final cycle of backcross introgression or in screenings for homozygous plants in segregating populations. Finally, a third PCR assay was developed by means of TaqMan technology as a high-throughput alternative for selection of the 2NS/2AS translocation in large segregating populations in breeding programs that have access to real time PCR equipment. These molecular markers were used to develop four hard red spring isogenic lines homozygous for the 2NS chromosome segment. One of the isogenic lines, derived from 'Anza,' did not show the expected resistance in spite of the presence of all the RFLP markers for the 2NS chromosome segment. Analysis of F-1 hybrids suggested that a suppressor of the Lr37 gene is present in Anza. These isogenic lines will provide a valuable tool to test the effects of the large 2NS translocation on quality and agronomic performance.

AB We report a genetic recombination map for Sorghum of 2512 loci spaced at average 0.4 cM (similar to300 kb) intervals based on 2050 RFLP probes, including 865 heterologous probes that foster comparative genomics of Saccharum (sugarcane), Zea (maize), Oryza (rice), Pennisetum (millet, buffelgrass), the Triticeae (wheat, barley, oat, rye), and Arabidopsis. Mapped loci identify 61.5% of the recombination events in this progeny set and reveal strong positive crossover interference acting across intervals of :550 cM. Significant variations in DNA marker density are related to possible centromeric regions and to probable chromosome structural rearrangements between Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum, but not to variation in levels of intraspecific allelic richness. While cDNA and genomic clones are similarly distributed across the genome, SSR-containing clones show different abundance patterns. Rapidly evolving hypomethylated DNA may contribute to intraspecific genomic differentiation. Nonrandom distribution patterns of multiple loci detected by 357 probes suggest ancient chromosomal duplication followed by extensive rearrangement and gene loss. Exemplifying the value of these data for comparative genomics, we support and extend prior findings regarding maize-sorghum synteny-in particular, 45% of comparative loci fall outside the inferred colinear/syntenic regions, suggesting that many small rearrangements have occurred since maize-sorghum divergence. These genetically anchored sequence-tagged sites will foster many structural, functional and evolutionary genomic studies in major food, feed, and biomass crops.

AB The isolation of (GA)(n) microsatellites using a highly microsatellite-enriched library is described for the first time in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). A relatively simple and effective method to isolate DNA repeats from microsatellite-enriched libraries based on hybridization-capture of repeat regions using biotin-conjugated oligonucleotids and non-radioactive colony hybridization was carried out. PCR products from 200 to 800 bp were obtained and cloned. Of the 60 clones sequenced, 21 yielded (GA), microsatellites with n values equal or higher than six. These (GA)(n) microsatellite-containing loci could be useful for further genetic mapping studies. A (GA), microsatellite linked to a putative MADS-box gene was identified. This sequence, which represents the first MADS-box locus described to date in common bean, showed a very high similarity with other known MADS-box sequences and was grouped within the AGL2 subfamily cluster of the Arabidopsis MADS-box genes. The vicinity of microsatellites to some genes is also discussed.

AB Septoria tritici leaf blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), is an economically important disease of wheat. Breeding for resistance to STB is the most effective means to control this disease and can be facilitated through the use of molecular markers. However, molecular markers linked to most genes for resistance to STB are not yet available. This study was conducted to test for resistance in the parents of a standard wheat mapping population and to map any resistance genes identified. The population consisted of 130 F-10 recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between the synthetic hexaploid wheat W7984 and cv. Opata 85. Genetic analysis indicated that a single major gene controls resistance to M. graminicola in this population. This putative resistance gene is now designated Stb8 and was mapped with respect to amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. An AFLP marker, EcoRI-ACG/MseI-CAG5, was linked in repulsion with the resistance gene at a distance of approximately 5.3 centimorgans (cM). Two flanking microsatellite markers, Xgwm146 and Xgwm577, were linked to the Stb8 gene on the long arm of wheat chromosome 7B at distances of 3.5 and 5.3 cM, respectively. The microsatellite markers identified in this study have potential for use in marker-assisted selection in breeding programs and for pyramiding of Stb8 with other genes for resistance to M. graminicola in wheat.

AB The identification and location of sources of genetic resistance to plant diseases are important contributions to the development of resistant varieties. The combination of different sources and types of resistance in the same genotype should assist in the development of durably resistant varieties. Using a doubled haploid (DH), mapping population of barley, we mapped a qualitative resistance gene (Rpsx) to barley stripe rust in the accession CI10587 (PI 243183) to the long arm of chromosome 1(7H). We combined the Rpsx gene, through a series of crosses, with three mapped and validated barley stripe rust resistance QTL alleles located on chromosomes 4(4H) (QTL4), 5(1H) (QTL5), and 7(5H) (QTL7). Three different barley DH populations were developed from these crosses, two combining Rpsx with QTL4 and QTL7, and the third combining Rpsx with QTL5. Disease severity testing in four environments and QTL mapping analyses confirmed the effects and locations of Rpsx, QTL4, and QTL5, thereby validating the original estimates of QTL location and effect. QTL alleles on chromosomes 4(4H) and 5(1H) were effective in decreasing disease severity in the absence of the resistance allele at Rpsx. Quantitative resistance effects were mainly additive, although magnitude interactions were detected. Our results indicate that combining qualitative and quantitative resistance in the same genotype is feasible. However, the durability of such resistance pyramids will require challenge from virulent isolates, which currently are not reported in North America.

AB Fusarium head blight of wheat is an extremely damaging disease, causing severe losses in seed yield and quality. The objective of the current study was to examine and characterize alternate sources of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB). Ninety-one F-1-derived doubled haploid lines from the cross Triticum aestivum 'Wuhan-1' x Triticum aestivum 'Maringa' were examined for disease reaction to Fusarium graminearum by single-floret injection in replicated greenhouse trials and by spray inoculation in replicated field trials. Field and greenhouse experiments were also used to collect agronomic and spike morphology characteristics. Seed samples from field plots were used for deoxynivalenol (DON) determination. A total of 328 polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to construct a genetic linkage map in this population and together these data were used to identify QTL controlling FHB resistance, accumulation of DON, and agronomic and spike morphology traits. The analysis identified QTL for different types of FHB resistance in four intervals on chromosomes 2DL, 3BS, and 4B. The QTLs on 4B and 3BS proximal to the centromere are novel and not reported elsewhere. QTL controlling accumulation of DON independent of FHB resistance were located on chromosomes 2DS and 5AS. Lines carrying FHB resistance alleles on 2DL and 3BS showed a 32% decrease in disease spread after single-floret injection. Lines carrying FHB resistance alleles on 3BS and 4B showed a 27% decrease from the mean in field infection. Finally, lines carrying favourable alleles on 3BS and 5AS, showed a 17% reduction in DON accumulation. The results support a polygenic and quantitative mode of inheritance and report novel FHB resistance loci. The data also suggest that resistance to FHB infection and DON accumulation may be controlled, in part, by independent loci and (or) genes.

AB Molecular genetic maps were constructed for two full-sib populations, TTC1 and TTC2, derived from two Leymus triticoides x Leymus cinereus hybrids and one common Leymus triticoides tester. Informative DNA markers were detected using 21 EcoRI-MseI and 17 PstI-MseI AFLP primer combinations, 36 anchored SSR or STS primer pairs, and 9 anchored RFLP probes. The 164-sib TTC1 map includes 1069 AFLP markers and 38 anchor loci in 14 linkage groups spanning 2001 cM. The 170-sib TTC2 map contains 1002 AFLP markers and 36 anchor loci in 14 linkage groups spanning 2066 cM. Some 488 homologous AFLP loci and 24 anchor markers detected in both populations showed similar map order. Thus, 1583 AFLP markers and 50 anchor loci were mapped into 14 linkage groups, which evidently correspond to the 14 chromosomes of allotetraploid Leymus (2n = 4x = 28). Synteny of two or more anchor markers from. each of the seven homoeologous wheat and barley chromosomes was detected for 12 of the 14 Leymus linkage groups. Moreover, two distinct sets of genome-specific STS markers were identified in these allotetraploid Leymus species. These Leymus genetic maps and populations will provide a useful system to evaluate the inheritance of functionally important traits of two divergent perennial grass species.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Sphaerotheca pannosa var. persicae is one of the most important diseases in European peach orchards. Quantitative trait loci controlling powdery mildew resistance were detected using three related F1, F2 and BC2 populations derived from the cross between the resistant parent P. davidiana clone P1908 and the susceptible peach cultivar Summergrand. Powdery mildew resistance of each population was evaluated under natural exposure, in several locations and over several years. Thirteen QTLs were detected. For nine of them, the favourable allele came from the resistant parent. Five QTLs were consistently detected across the three populations. The F1 hybrid used to produce F2 and BC2 populations had not inherited the favourable allele from P1908 for QTL detected on LG3 and LG8 in F1 population. QTLs were not detected in the corresponding regions in F2 and BC2 populations. In two other genomic areas, significant substitution effects between P1908 alleles were evidenced in the F1 population, but the favourable allele came from Summergrand in the F2 and BC2 populations. Analysis of phenotypic data suggested an important qualitative change in the distribution of powdery mildew resistance after 1996, confirmed by QTL analysis. Indeed, a dramatic decrease of the effect of the major QTL previously detected on LG6 was observed after 1996, while the QTL on LG8 was increasingly involved in the control of powdery mildew resistance. Consequences for peach breeding strategies to improve powdery mildew resistance are discussed.

AB Molecular markers based on DNA sequence variations of the coding and/or promoter regions of the wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) HMW glutenin genes located at the Glu-1 loci were developed. Markers characteristic of alleles Glu-A1-1a ( encoding Ax1 subunit) and Glu-A1-1c ( encoding Ax2* subunit) at the Glu-A1 locus, alleles Glu-B1ak ( encoding Bx7* subunit) and Glu-B1al for overexpressed Bx7 subunit at the Glu-B1 locus and alleles Glu-D1-1a ( encoding Dx2 subunit) and Glu-D1-1d ( encoding Dx5 subunit) at the Glu-D1 locus were tested using genomic DNA of haploid leaf tissue. A method for simultaneously extracting DNA from 96 haploid leaf tissue pieces is described. Two of the developed markers were dominant and two were co-dominant. A F-1-derived population segregating for all HMW glutenin genes was used to test the validity of the markers and their usefulness in doubled haploid breeding programs. SDS-PAGE analysis of seed storage protein was performed on seeds from the doubled haploid lines. A total of 299 lines were tested with the DNA markers on the haploid tissue and validated by protein analysis of the corresponding DH seeds. PCR markers and SDS-PAGE analysis showed between 2 and 8.5% discrepancies depending on the marker. Applications of DNA markers for gene-assisted-selection of haploid tissue and use in breeding programs are discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of dominant and co-dominant markers are outlined.

AB Direct gene transformation methods such as microprojectile bombardment have been successfully employed for obtaining transgenics in cereals in general and wheat in particular. As success of any transformation strategy depends largely upon the regeneration capability of the target explant, the present investigation employs leaf basal segments to achieve high regeneration response via somatic embryogenesis. Basal segments of 5-day-old seedlings of T. aestivum var. CPAN1676 and T. dicoccum var. DDK1001 were cultured on callusing medium for 3 weeks at 26 +/- 1 degreesC, discontinuous light followed by a culture period of 15 days at 21 +/- 1 degreesC in continuous light. The calli were then transferred to auxin-free medium for regeneration in discontinuous light at 26 +/- 1 degreesC. Regeneration via somatic embryogenesis was observed within 2 weeks in T. aestivum var. CPAN1676 and T. dicoccum var. DDK1001 (68 and 82%, respectively). This embryogenic calli were employed further to obtain hygromycin resistance by particle bombardment in T. aestivum and T. dicoccum. A transformation efficiency of 8.6, 7.5 and 4.9% was obtained in T. aestivum var. CPAN1676, PBW343 and T. dicoccum DDK1001, respectively. Presence of the transgene hptII (hygromycin) in T(0) plants was confirmed by Southern hybridization.

AB Genetic analysis of resistance to leaf rust in rye (Puccinia recondita f. sp. secalis) led to the identification of two dominant resistance genes, Pr1 and Pr2. Both genes proved to be effective against a local leaf-rust population as well as a subset of single-pustule isolates (SPIs) the latter of which comprised SPIs with very high virulence complexity. Resistance conferred by Pr1 and Pr2 was expressed in detached-leaf tests of seedlings as well as in field tests of adult plants. Molecular marker analysis allowed us to map Pr1 in the proximal part of rye chromosome 6RL, whereas Pr2 was assigned to the distal part of chromosome 7RL. These results are discussed in view of homoeology relationships among Triticeae. A proposal is submitted for the designation of resistance genes to rye leaf rust which would avoid interference with existing gene-symboling in respect to wheat leaf-rust resistances introgressed from rye into wheat or triticale.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB, scab) causes severe yield and quality losses, but the most serious concern is the mycotoxin contamination of cereal food and feed. The cultivation of resistant varieties may contribute to integrated control of this fungal disease. Breeding for FHB resistance by conventional selection is feasible, but tedious and expensive. The aim of this work was to detect QTLs for combined type I and type II resistance against FHB and estimate their effects in comparison to the QTLs identified previously for type II resistance. A population of 364, F-1 derived doubled-haploid (DH) lines from the cross 'CM-82036' (resistant)/'Remus' (susceptible) was evaluated for components of FHB resistance during 2 years under field conditions. Plants were inoculated at anthesis with a conidial suspension of Fusarium graminearum or Fusarium culmorum. The crop was kept wet for 20 h after inoculation by mist-irrigation. Disease severity was assessed by visual scoring. Initial QTL analysis was performed on 239 randomly chosen DH lines and extended to 361 lines for putative QTL regions. Different marker types were applied, with an emphasis on PCR markers. Analysis of variance, as well as simple and composite interval mapping, revealed that two genomic regions were significantly associated with FHB resistance. The two QTLs on chromosomes 3B (Qfhs.ndsu-3BS) and 5A (Qfhs.ifa-5A) explained 29 and 20% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, for visual FHB severity. Qfhs.ndsu-3BS appeared to be associated mainly with resistance to fungal spread, and Qfhs.ifa-5A primarily with resistance to fungal penetration. Both QTL regions were tagged with flanking SSR markers. These results indicate that FHB resistance was under the control of two major QTLs operating together with unknown numbers of minor genes. Marker-assisted selection for these two major QTLs appears feasible and should accelerate the development of resistant and locally adapted wheat cultivars.

AB Two populations of single chromosome recombinant lines were used to map genes controlling flowering time on chromosome 5B of wheat, and one of the populations was also used to map a new frost resistance gene. Genetic maps were developed, mainly using microsatellite markers, and QTL analysis was applied to phenotypic data on the performance of each population collected from growth-room tests of flowering time and frost tolerance. Using a recombinant substitution-line mapping population derived from a cross between the substitution-line 'Chinese Spring' ('Cheyenne' 5B) and 'Chinese Spring' (CS), the gene Vrn-B1, affecting vernalization response, an earliness per se locus, Eps-5BL1, and a gene, Fr-B1, affecting frost resistance, were mapped. Using a 'Hobbit Sib' ('Chinese Spring' 5BL) x 'Hobbit Sib' recombinant substitution line mapping population, an earliness per se locus, Eps-5BL2 was mapped. The Vrn-B1 locus was mapped on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 5B, to a region syntenous with the segments of chromosomes 5A and 5D containing Vrn-A1 and Vrn-D1 loci, respectively. The two Eps-5BL loci were mapped close to the centromere with a 16-cM distance from each other, one in agreement with the position of a homoeologous locus previously mapped on chromosome 5H of barley, and suggested by the response of 'Chinese Spring' deletion lines. The Fr-B1 gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5B, 40 cM from the centromeric marker. Previous comparative mapping data with rice chromosome 9 would suggest that this gene could be orthologous to the other Fr genes mapped previously by us on chromosomes 5A or 5D of wheat, although in a more proximal position. This study completes the mapping of these homoeoallelic series of vernalization requirement genes and frost resistance genes on the chromosomes of the homoeologous group 5 in wheat.

AB Resistance to the disease septoria tritici blotch of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel.) J. Schrot in Cohn (anamorph Septoria tritici Roberge in Desmaz.) was investigated in a doubled-haploid (DH) population of a cross between the susceptible winter wheat cultivar Savannah and the resistant cultivar Senat. A molecular linkage map of the population was constructed including 76 SSR loci and 244 AFLP loci. Parents and DH progeny were tested for resistance to single isolates of M. graminicola in a growth chamber at the seedling stage, and to an isolate mixture at the adult plant stage, in field trials. A gene located at or near the Stb6 locus mapping to chromosome 3A provided seedling resistance to IPO323. Two complementary genes, mapping to chromosome 3A, one of which was the IPO323 resistance gene, were needed for resistance to the Danish isolate Riso97-86. In addition, a number of minor loci influenced the expression of resistance in the growth chamber. In the field, four QTLs for resistance to septoria tritici blotch were detected. Two QTLs, located on chromosomes 3A and 6B explained 18.2 and 67.9% of the phenotypic variance in the mean over two trials. Both these QTLs were also detected at the seedling stage with isolate Riso97-86, whereas isolate IPO323 only detected the QTL on 3A. Additionally, two QTLs identified in adult plants on chromosomes 2B and 7B were not detected at the seedling stage. Four QTLs were detected for plant height located on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 3B and on a linkage group not assigned to a chromosome. The major QTLs on 3A and on the unassigned linkage group were consistent over two trials, and the QTL on 3A seemed to be linked to a QTL for septoria tritici blotch resistance.

AB The efficient and reproducible production of stably expressing transgenic rye plants is described. Analysis of the genotype-specific callus culture-response of 21 rye inbred lines, single crosses and a population variety resulted in the identification of the highly responsive inbred line L22. Biolistic transformation experiments were performed using line L22 and the impact of different selection agents on the regeneration capacity was analyzed. Using the selectable marker gene nptII and corresponding paromomycin selection resulted in transformation efficiencies of up to 4.0% of the bombarded explants. A total of 17 independent transgenic rye plants were produced, and their stability and level of transgene expression was analyzed. The majority of these lines showed stable transgene expression. In contrast a few transgenic lines with multiple transgene inserts, provided evidence of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing.

AB Two Heterodera avenae resistance genes, Cre2 from Aegilops ventricosa AP-1 and Cre5 from Ae. ventricosa #10, were shown to confer a high level of resistance to the Spanish pathotype Ha71. No susceptible plants were found in the F-2 progeny from the cross between the two accessions of Ae. ventricosa, suggesting that their respective resistance factors were allelic. However, genes Cre2 and Cre5 apparently were transferred to a different chromosomal location in the wheat line H-93-8 and in the 6M(v)(6D) substitution, respectively, as proved by F-2 segregation of their cross progeny. The induction of several defence responses during early infection by the same H. avenae pathotype in resistant lines carrying Cre2 or Cre5 genes was studied. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) isozyme analysis revealed that peroxidase, esterase and superoxide dismutase activity increased after nematode infection, in roots of resistant lines in comparison with their susceptible parents. Differential induced isoforms were also identified when IEF patterns of resistant lines were compared. A DNA marker, absent in Cre5-carrying genotypes, was found to be linked, thought not very tightly, to the Cre2 gene in the H-93-8 line. The differences observed between the Cre2 and Cre5 genes with respect to their chromosomal location in wheat introgression lines, de-toxificant enzyme induction and behaviour against different pathotypes, suggest they are different H. avenae resistance sources for wheat breeding.

AB Baankuti 1201, an old Hungarian wheat variety with special quality traits, was analysed to determine the relationships between its storage protein composition and superior quality-attributes for breadmaking. Based on the storage protein composition, the variety appears to have the nature of a population, containing several genotypes with different gluten protein alleles. Using molecular markers, a new mutant x-type HMW glutenin allele was identified, containing an extra cysteine residue and showing a moderate, positive-effect on gluten properties. In lines possessing subunits Bx7+By8 the overexpression of the Bx-type subunit could be detected, resulting in a higher unextractable polymeric protein (UPP) content and increased dough strength. It was found that the presence or absence of subunit Bx7 has an equilibrating effect on the dough extensibility, which is generally characteristic of the Baankuti 1201 population. The complex good bread-making quality of the variety, which has strong but highly extensible dough, is probably due to the balance between lines which express subunit Bx7 and those which do not.

AB Accessions from Cicer echinospermum, a wild relative of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), contain resistance to the fungal disease ascochyta blight, a devastating disease of chickpea. A linkage map was constructed based on an interspecific F(2) population, derived from a cross between a susceptible chickpea cultivar (Lasseter) and a resistant C. echinospermum accession (PI 527930). The linkage map incorporated 83 molecular markers, that included RAPD, ISSR, STMS and RGA markers; eight markers remained unlinked. The map comprised eight linkage groups and covered a map distance of 570 cM. Six out of the eight linkage groups were correlated to linkage groups from the integrated Cicer map using STMS markers. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with ascochyta blight resistance were detected using interval mapping and single-point analysis. The F(2) population was evaluated for seedling and stem resistance in glasshouse trials. At least two QTLs were identified for seedling resistance, both of which were located within linkage group 4. Five markers were associated with stem resistance, four of which were also associated with seedling resistance. QTLs from previous studies also mapped to LG 4, suggesting that this linkage group is an important region of the Cicer genome for resistance to ascochyta blight.

AB The number of dominant Vrn genes in common wheat, Triticum aestivum L., is estimated. Data were obtained supporting Pugsley's and Gotoh's data on the presence of a dominant gene Vrn4 in near-isogenic line 'Triple Dirk F'. The presence of a dominant gene Vrn4 in line 'Gabo-2' of cultivar 'Gabo', which was used by Pugsley as a donor of the gene Vrn4 for the near-isogenic line 'Triple Dirk F', was also confirmed. The Vrn2 and Vrn4 relationship and their chromosomal location are discussed. It was demonstrated that the dominant Vrn8 gene which was introgressed from Triticum sphaerococcum to common wheat by Stelmakh and Avsenin is allelic to Vrn4. While genes Vrn6(sc) and Vrn7(sc) which were introgressed from rye, Secale cereale L., by the above-mentioned authors are not allelic to the genes Vrn1, Vrn2, Vrn3 and Vrn4.

AB The promoter regions of HMW glutenin x-type genes at the Glu-D1 locus were surveyed for SNPs within a subpopulation of German bread wheat cultivars. On the basis of the promoter sequences of HMW glutenin subunit genes Glu-A1-x1, Glu-A1-x2, Glu-B1-x1, Glu-B1-x7, Glu-D1-x2, and Glu-D1-x5, an amplification refractory mutation system assay was designed to selectively amplify Dx-specific PCR fragments. Comparative sequence analysis among seven Glu-D1-x2 and seven Glu-D1-x5 wheat cultivars only confirmed a G-A transition in the promoter sequence to be a true polymorphism. SNP scoring by DHPLC of 95 German bread wheat cultivars, with the exception of cv. Anemos, showed that the transition completely agreed with the presence of HMW glutenin subunits 1 Dx5 + 1Dy10 in SIDS-PAGE. Therefore, the developed DHPLC assay is suitable for high-throughput genotyping to assist the selection of HMW glutenin genes in wheat quality breeding programs.

AB Genetic analyses of complex traits in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are facilitated by the availability of unique genetic tools such as chromosome substitution lines and recombinant inbred chromosome lines (RICLs) which allow the effects of genes on single chromosomes to be studied individually. Chromosome 3A of 'Wichita' is known to contain alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence variation in grain yield and agronomic performance traits relative to alleles of 'Cheyenne'. To determine the number, location, and environmental interactions of genes related to agronomic performance on chromosome 3A, QTL and QTL X environment analyses of 98 RICLs-3A were conducted in seven locations across Nebraska from 1999 through 2001. QTLs were detected for seven of eight agronomic traits measured and generally localized to three regions of chromosome 3A. QTL X environment interactions were detected for some QTLs and these interactions were caused by changes in magnitude and crossover interactions. Major QTLs for kernels per square meter and grain yield were associated within a 5-centimorgan (cM) interval and appeared to represent a single QTL with pleiotropic effects. This particular QTL displayed environmental interactions caused by changes in magnitude, wherein the positive effect of the Wichita QTL allele was larger in higher yielding environments.

AB Theoretical comparisons for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping properties were conducted among simulated recombinant inbred (RI) populations developed by single- hill (SH), complete bulk, and single seed descent (SSD) procedures by Monte Carlo simulations based on various population sizes, heritabilities, and QTL effects. Our simulations included estimation of QTL effects, QTL positions, and statistical testing power in the RI populations by comparing the estimates with preset values. The simulation results showed that the single hill ( SH) bulk and single seed descent RI populations were generally not significantly different with respect to quality of estimated QTL effects and positions. Furthermore, when each RI population had 150 lines, each could provide desirable properties for QTL mapping. The results implied that a SH RI population consisting of 75 or more F-2-derived families with two lines per family ( corresponding population size of 150 or above) was appropriate for QTL mapping and was not significantly different than a SSD RI population of 150. Thus, the SH method could be used to develop large numbers of RI lines for achieving better results in QTL mapping. Simulations also showed that there was no significant difference between means using SH methods with 10 and 100 fruits per family. However, RI populations developed by the complete bulk method where F-2 identities are lost were not suitable for QTL mapping.

AB Ten elite near-isogenic line (NIL) pairs of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L ern TheII) each carrying one of the two alien leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes Lr32 and Lr28, derived from Triticum tauschil and Triticum speltoides, respectively were tested for disease phenotype in controlled conditions. The disease phenotype of the NIL pair detected distinction between the Lr32 donor parent and its derivatives in ten cultivar backgrounds documented as carrying the gene Lr32. The RAPID and SCAR molecular markers identified earlier as linked to Lr32 amplified the critical marker bands identically in eight of the ten NIL pairs as well as the Lr28 donor parent. The critical bands were not amplified in the Lr32 donor parent. A Triticum speltoides specific microsatellite null allele marker located on chromosome 4AL, the genomic region associated with Lr28, expressed in an identical polymorphism as the RAPD and SCAR markers. The PCR product sequenced from a NIL pair revealed 100% homology. It is confirmed that eight of the ten elite Lr32 lines carry the gene Lr28. Molecular marker tools need to be employed to eliminate such miss-identities and reduce redundancy in Indian elite germplasm stocks of wheat possessing the alien Lr genes.

AB Host plant resistance is an economical and environmentally sound method of control of leaf rust caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina. which is one of the most serious diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Wild relatives of wheat. including the tetraploid T timopheevii subsp. anneniacum, represent an important source of genes for resistance to leaf rust. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the performance of leaf rust resistance genes previously transferred to wheat from three accessions of T timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, (ii) determine inheritance and allelic relationship of the new leaf rust resistance genes, and (iii) determine the genetic map location of one of the T timopheevii subsp. armeniacum-derived genes using microsatellite markers. The leaf rust resistance gene transferred to hexaploid wheat from accession TA 28 of T timopheevii subsp. armeniocum exhibited slightly different infection types (ITs) to diverse races of leaf rust in inoculated tests of seedlings compared with the gene transferred from TA 870 and TA 874. High ITs were exhibited when seedlings of all the germ plasm lines were inoculated with P. triticina races MBRL and PNMQ. However, low ITs were observed on adult plants of all lines having the T timopheevii subsp. armeniacum-derived genes for resistance in the field at locations in Kansas and Texas. Analysis of crosses between resistant germ plasm lines showed that accessions TA 870 and TA 874 donated the same gene for resistance to leaf rust and TA 28 donated an independent resistance gene. The gene donated to germ plasm line KS96WGRC36 from TA 870 of T timopheevii subsp. armeniacum was linked to microsatellite markers Xgwm382 (6.7 cM) and Xgdm87 (9.4 cM) on wheat chromosome arm 213 long. This new leaf rust resistance gene is designated Lr50. It is the first named gene for leaf rust resistance transferred from wild timopheevi wheat and is the only Lr gene located on the long arm of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes.

AB Leaf rust and stripe rust. caused by Puccinia triticina and P. striiformis. respectively, are important diseases of wheat in many countries. In this study, we sought to identify molecular markers for adult plant resistance genes that could aid in incorporating such durable resistance into wheat. We used a doubled haploid population from a Japanese cv. Fukuho-komugi x Israeli wheat Oligoculm cross that had segregated for resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust in field trials. Joint and/or single-year analyses by composite interval mapping identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL) that reduced leaf rust severity and up to 11 and 7 QTLs that might have influenced stripe rust severity and infection type, respectively. Four common QTLs reduced stripe rust severity and infection type. Except for a QTL on chromosome 7DS, no common QTL for leaf rust and stripe rust was detected. QTL-7DS derived from 'Fukuho-komugi' had the largest effect on both leaf rust and stripe rust severities, possibly due to linked resistance genes Lr34/Yr18. The microsatellite locus Xgwin295.1, located almost at the peak of the likelihood ratio contours for both leaf and stripe rust severity, was closest to Lr34/Yr18. QTLs located on 1BL for leaf rust severity and 3BS for stripe rust infection type were derived from 'Oligoculm' and considered to be due to genes Lr46 and Yr30, respectively. Most of the remaining QTLs for stripe rust severity or infection type had smaller effects. Our results indicate there is significant diversity for genes that have minor effects on stripe rust resistance, and that successful detection of these QTLs by molecular markers should be helpful both for characterizing wheat genotypes effectively and combining such resistance genes.

AB Wheat genes for pathogenesis-related (PR-)proteins, chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase, under the control of maize ubiquitin promoter-intron were used for transforming the spring wheat 'Bobwhite', using a biolistic approach. Twenty of the 24 primary transgenic lines expressing the PR-protein genes in the T-0 generation were silenced in either the T-1 or T-2 generations. Two apparently genetically identical regenerants arising from a single callus co-bombarded with chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase transgene combinations, but differing in the expression of the transgenes were selected for further characterization. In one homozygous line, transgene silencing was observed in the T-3 plants, while the other line homozygous for the transgene loci stably expressed and inherited the transgenes to at least the T-4 generation. Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA from the two lines using the isoschizomeric methylation-sensitive enzymes, MspI and Hpall, revealed a higher degree of methylation of CCGG sequences in the line with the silenced transgene locus. Analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blotting and Western blotting detected stable expression of the transgenes in the line with a lesser extent of methylation, whereas the line with a higher level of CCGG methylation had no transgene expression by the T-3 generation. The germination of seeds from the silenced plants in the presence of a cytidine analogue, 5-azacyticline (azaC), did not lead to a reversion of this phenotype.

AB In order to evaluate the long-term stability of transgene expression driven by the B-1- and D-hordein promoters in transgenic barley (Hordeum vulgare L., 2n=2x=14), we analyzed plants from 15 independent transgenic barley lines [6 for uidA and 9 for sgfp(S65T)] produced via microprojectile bombardment of immature embryos; 4 were diploid and 11 were tetraploid. The expression and inheritance of transgenes were determined by analysis of functional transgene expression, polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Ability to express transgenes driven by either B-1- or D-hordein promoter was inherited in T-4 and later generations: T-4 (2 lines), T-5 (8 lines), T-6 (3 lines), T-8 (1 line) and T-9 (1 line). Homozygous transgenic plants were obtained from 12 lines [5 for uidA and 7 for sgfp(S65T)]; the remaining lines are currently being analyzed. The application of the FISH technique for physical mapping of chromosomes was useful for early screening of homozygous plants by examining for presence of the transgene. For example, one line expressing uidA, and shown to have doublet fluorescence signals on a pair of homologous chromosomes was confirmed as a homozygous line by its segregation ratio; additionally this line showed stable inheritance of the transgene to T-9 progeny. The expression of transgenes in most lines (14 out of 15 lines) driven by hordein promoters was stably transmitted to T-4 or later generations, although there was a skewed segregation pattern (1:1) from the T-1 generation onward in the remaining line. In contrast, transgene silencing or transgene loss under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter was observed in progeny of only 6 out of 15 lines.

AB The dental pulp is a favorable model for studies of interactions between nociceptive sensory neurons and their peripheral target tissues. In the present study, we retrogradely labeled pulpal afferent neurons with an improved method that permits monitoring of changes in neuronal phenotype in response to controlled tooth injuries. The capacity of retrograde neuronal tracers, to diffuse through dentinal tubules was exploited, thereby avoiding the severe injury to the pulp associated with previous tracer application methods. The strategy was to apply the durable fluorescent tracer, Fluoro-gold (FG), to exposed dentin in the floor of shallow cavities in molars, in order to pre-label pulpal neurons in trigeminal ganglia of young adult Sprague-Dawley rats. A high percentage of pupal afferent neurons were retrogradely labeled by application of FG to exposed dentin and the FG fluorescent signal persisted in most labeled neurons for at least 8 weeks. Following tracer application to dentin, the pulp tissue appeared normal histologically, with the exception that a layer of reactive dentin was deposited at the pulp-dentin border beneath the shallow cavities. Assessment of expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) indicated that pulpal neurons remained in a quiescent, baseline condition cytochemically following application of tracer to cavities in dentin and upregulation of these markers could be detected in neurons that projected to teeth that received a test injury subsequent to tracer application. Thus, labeling of trigeminal neurons via dentinal tubules provides the basis for a useful model for precisely assessing properties of pulpal afferents in both quiescent and activated states.

AB The genomic composition of 1911289, a wheat ( Tritium aestivum L.) maintainer of K-CMS, was examined by several methods, such as genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), biochemical marking, and DNA molecular marking. The results got by GISH and PCR amplification of dispersed rye-specific repetitive DNA sequence suggested that the alien chromatin in T911289 derived from rye. Specifically PCR amplification of the rye-specific microsatellite primers (SCM9) and seed storage protein analysis indicated that the alien chromatin in T911289 had developed from the short arm of 1R chromosome of rye (1RS). PCR amplification by using microsatellite primers locating on 1BS and seed storage protein analysis also revealed that 1911289 had lost the arm of 1BS or a small distal segment of it. We conclude that T911289 is a heterogeneous population which displays two distinct different types of translocation, i.e. the Robertsonian translocation and small segment translocation. The Robertsonian translocation type observed in our study is different from the 1BL/1RS translocation which is widely used in wheat production; it may be a novel and complex translocation form. Though the linkage between the desirable agronomic traits and the deleterious genes expressed as sticky dough has not got broken in T911289, the recovery of small segment translocation will still benefit the genetic study of wheat and rye.

AB We report the map-based cloning of the leaf rust resistance gene Lr21, previously mapped to a gene-rich region at the distal end of chromosome arm 1DS of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Molecular cloning of Lr21 was facilitated by diploid/polyploid shuttle mapping strategy. Cloning of Lr21 was confirmed by genetic transformation and by a stably inherited resistance phenotype in transgenic plants. Lr21 spans 4318 bp and encodes a 1080-amino-acid protein containing a conserved nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, 13 imperfect leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and a unique 151-amino-acid sequence missing from known NBS-LRR proteins at the N terminus. Fine-structure genetic analysis at the Lr21 locus detected a noncrossover (recombination without exchange of flanking markers) within a 1415-bp region resulting from either a gene conversion tract of at least 191 bp or a double crossover. The successful map-based cloning approach as demonstrated here now opens the door for cloning of many crop-specific agronomic traits located in the gene-rich regions of bread wheat.

AB Primers based on conserved motifs of plant resistance genes were used to generate multilocus molecular markers - referred to as resistance gene analog polymorphisms (RGAPs) - in Pinus oocarpa subsp. oocarpa. Ten populations from three regions of Nicaragua were analyzed with 53 RGAPs. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of within- and between-population diversity with this kind of marker, and to compare estimates with previously obtained results based on RAPD and AFLP. All populations showed high levels of diversity. G(ST) values and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed most. variation to be within populations, although significant differences between populations and regions were also detected. This pattern of genetic diversity was similar to that obtained for RAPD and AFLP, which suggests that variation at RGAP loci as detected in this work is mostly influence by nonselective forces.

AB Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent a new form of functional marker, particularly when they are derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A bioinformatics strategy was developed to discover SNPs within a large wheat EST database and to demonstrate the utility of SNPs in genetic mapping and genetic diversity applications. A collection of >90 000 wheat ESTs was assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs), and 45 random contigs were then visually inspected to identify primer pairs capable of amplifying specific alleles. We estimate that homoeologue sequence variants occurred 1 in 24 by and the frequency of SNPs between wheat genotypes was 1 SNP/540 by (theta = 0.0069). Furthermore, we estimate that one diagnostic SNP test can be developed from every contig with 10-60 EST members. Thus, EST databases are an abundant source of SNP markers. Polymorphism information content for SNPs ranged from 0.04 to 0.50 and ESTs could be mapped into a framework of microsatellite markers using segregating populations. The results showed that SNPs in wheat can be discovered in ESTs, validated, and be applied to conventional genetic studies.

AB The genetic control of seed glucosinolate content in oilseed rape was investigated using two intervarietal backcross populations. Four QTLs segregating in the population derived from a Brassica napus L. 'Victor' x Brassica napus L. 'Tapidor' cross, together accounting for 76% of the phenotypic variation, were mapped. Three of these loci also appeared to control the accumulation of seed glucosinolates in a Brassica napus L. 'Bienvenu' x 'Tapidor' cross, and accounted for 86% of the phenotypic variation. The three QTLs common to both populations mapped to homoeologous regions of the B. napus genome, suggesting that seed glucosinolate accumulation is controlled by duplicate genes. It was possible to extend the comparative analysis of QTLs controlling seed glucosinolate accumulation by aligning the published genetic maps generated by several research groups. This comparative mapping demonstrated that high-glucosinolate varieties often carry low-glucosinolate alleles at one or more of the loci controlling seed glucosinolate accumulation.

AB The leaf rust resistance gene Lr19 , transferred from Agropyron elongatum into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) imparts resistance to all pathotypes of leaf rust (Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici ) in South-east Asia. A segregating F-2 population from a cross between the leaf rust resistant parent 'HW 2046' carrying Lr19 and a susceptible parent 'Agra Local' was screened in the phytotron against a virulent pathotype 77-5 of leaf rust with the objective of identifying the molecular markers linked to Lr19 . The gene was first tagged with a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker S73(728). The RAPD marker linked to the gene Lr19 which mapped at 6.4+/-0.035 cM distance, was converted to a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker. The SCAR marker (SCS73(719)) was specific to Lr19 and was not amplified in the near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying other equally effective alien genes Lr9 , Lr28 and Lr32 enabling breeders to pyramid Lr19 with these genes.

AB An F-2 population segregating for the dominant gene Vrn-B1 was developed from the cross of the substitution line 'Diamant'/'Mironovskaya 808 5A' and the winter wheat cultivar 'Bezostaya 1'. Microsatellite markers (Xgwm and Xbarc) with known map locations on chromosome 5B of common wheat were used for mapping the gene Vrn-B1 . Polymorphism between parental varieties was observed for 28 out of 34 microsatellite markers (82%). Applying the quantitative trait loci mapping approach, the target gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5B, closely linked to Xgwm408. The map position of Vrn-B1 suggests that the gene is homoeologous to other vernalization response genes located on the homoeologous group 5 chromosomes of wheat, rye and barley.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum in North America can result in significant losses in the yield and quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L). Resistance sources have been largely limited to Chinese germplasm and, in particular, Sumai 3 or its derivatives. In recent years, resistance has been identified in Europe. Previous studies using the wheat line 'Bizel', developed in France, have shown that it has resistance to Fusarium head blight. Pedigree information shows that one of its progenitors is rye. This experiment was conducted to determine if 'Bizel' has rye chromatin, with the goal of developing a strategy for mapping FHB resistance genes. Two methods based on repetitive DNA sequences specific to rye were implemented. With both approaches, it was demonstrated that 'Bizel' does not contain rye chromatin. Consequently, wheat SSRs can be used to map 'Bizel' resistance genes for FHB.

AB An Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system with glyphosate selection has been developed for the large-scale production of transgenic plants. The system uses 4-day precultured immature embryos as explants. A total of 30 vectors containing the 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene from Agrobacterium strain CP4 (aroA:CP4), which confers resistance to glyphosate, were introduced into wheat using this system. The aroA:CP4 gene served two roles in this study-selectable marker and gene of interest. More than 3,000 transgenic events were produced with an average transformation efficiency of 4.4%. The entire process from isolation of immature embryos to production of transgenic plantlets was 50-80 days. Transgenic events were evaluated over several generations based on genetic, agronomic and molecular criteria. Forty-six percent of the transgenic events fit a 3:1 segregation ratio. Molecular analysis confirmed that four of six lead transgenic events selected from Agrobacterium transformation contained a single insert and a single copy of the transgene. Stable expression of the aroA:CP4 gene was confirmed by ELISA through nine generations. A comparison of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to a particle bombardment system demonstrated that the Agrobacterium system is reproducible, has a higher transformation efficiency with glyphosate selection and produces higher quality transgenic events in wheat. One of the lead events from this study, no. 33391, has been identified as a Roundup Ready wheat commercial candidate.

AB Previously, we described a Cre-lox based strategy to convert a complex multi-copy integration pattern to a single-copy transgene (Srivastava et al., 1999). When a lox-containing transgenic line of wheat was crossed with a cre-expressing line, extra copies of the transgene were deleted by site-specific recombination. This process included the removal of a lox-flanked selection marker gene, bar. Three out of six F-1 plants were chimeric for the resolved and the complex loci because both completely resolved and incompletely resolved patterns were found in the F-2 population. From one F-1 plant, 4 out of 20 F-2 progeny showed not only incomplete resolution of the complex integration pattern, but also the presence of a circular loxP-bar-nos3' fragment, which we refer to as the bar circle. This bar circle was detected in subsequent generations, and was associated with the presence of both the lox transgene and the cre locus. We hypothesize that the cre gene in these bar circle plants must have undergone a genetic or epigenetic change that altered the spatial and/or temporal pattern of cre expression. Late expression might excise the DNA incompletely, and late in development. What is surprising is that the DNA is not degraded, but remains in the cells as an extra-chromosomal circular molecule.

AB The expression of Triticum aestivum PR4 genes is regulated in response to infection with Fusarium culmorum, a widespread soilborne pathogen that causes severe damages in crops through foot rot. The induction of PR4 transcripts in wheat coleoptils and roots is correlated with the expression of the corresponding proteins that are expressed only in the infected tissues. Wheat PR4 genes and proteins are also inducible upon treatments with systemic acquired resistance (SAR) chemical inducers such as salicylic acid (SA), benzo (1.2.3) thiodiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) indicating that activation of PR4 genes follows both SA- and JA-dependent defence response pathways. Moreover, wheat PR4 genes are induced in response to wounding in young shoots and roots as well as in mature leaves suggesting that they can be considered useful markers of plant defence response, although SAR has not been conclusively demonstrated in wheat. Wheat PR1 and PR5 genes used for comparison did not respond to either SAR activators or pathogen attack. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Wx-D1 gene, which was found in a mutant waxy wheat, and which expressed the Wx-D1 protein (granule-bound starch synthase I) as shown by immunoblot analysis. We also assayed starch synthase activity of granule-bound proteins. Using 22 doubled-haploid (DH) lines and 172 F-5 lines derived from the wild type x the mutant, we detected SNP via a PCR-based (dCAPS) marker. Amplified PCR products from Wx-D1 gene-specific primers, followed by mismatched primers designed for dCAPS analysis, were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme. The two alleles, and the heterozygote genotype were easily and rapidly discriminated by gel-electrophoresis resolution to reveal SNP. All progeny lines that have the SNP of the mutant allele were waxy. Integrating the results of dCAPS analysis, immunoblot analysis and assays of starch synthase activity of granule-bound proteins indicates that the SNP in the Wx-D1 gene was responsible for its waxy character. This dCAPS marker is therefore useful as a marker to introduce the mutant allele into elite breeding lines.

AB The coding regions of 28 entries of hexaploid wheat gamma-gliadin genes, gene fragments or pseudogenes in GenBank were used for nucleotide alignment. These sequences could be divided into nine subgroups based on nucleotide variation. The chromosomal locations of five of the seven unassigned subgroups were identified through subgroup-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using Chinese Spring group-1 nulli-tetrasomic lines. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions were identified in each subgroup. With further mining from wheat expressed sequence tag databases and targeted DNA sequencing, two SNPs were confirmed and one SNP was discovered for genes at the Gli-A1, Gli-B1 and Gli-D1 loci. A modified allele-specific PCR procedure for assaying SNPs was used to generate dominant DNA markers based on these three SNPs. For each of these three SNPs, two allele-specific primer sets were used to test Chinese Spring and 52 commercial Australian wheat varieties representing a range of low-molecular-weight (LMW) alleles. PCR results indicated that all were positive with one of the primer sets and negative with the other, with the exception of three varieties containing the 1BL/1RS chromosomal translocation that were negative for both. Furthermore, markers GliA1.1, GliB1.1 and GliD1.1 were found to be correlated with Glu-A3 a, b or c, Glu-B3 b, c, d or e and Glu-D3 a, b or e LMW glutenin alleles, respectively. Markers GliA1.2, GliB1.2 and GliD1.2 were found to be correlated with the Glu-A3 d or e, Glu-B3 a, g or h and Glu-D3 c alleles, respectively. These results indicated that the gamma-gliadin SNP markers could be used for detecting linked LMW glutenin subunit alleles that are important in determining the quality attributes of wheat products.

AB Intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) represent the major vagal afferent structures throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Previous ultrastructural investigations have revealed synaptic contacts of IGLEs on myenteric neurons. Thus, in addtion to functioning probably as mechanosensors, IGLEs may also synaptically influence myenteric neurons. In search of clues for potential transmitters in IGLEs, we investigated, by combined neuronal tracing and immunocytochemistry in the esophagus, the correlation between IGLEs and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), which is considered a reliable marker for glutamatergic neurons. In rat esophagus, IGLEs were immunostained with calretinin. In the mouse, anterograde wheat germ agglutinin/horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) tracing from nodose ganglion was used in order to label esophageal IGLEs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that VGLUT2 immunoreactivity was highly colocalized with synaptophysin and that both calretinin and tyramide amplified WGA-HRP in rat and mouse esophagus, respectively. No colocalization was found with calcitonin gene-related peptide, a marker for spinal primary afferents. Thus, VGLUT2 is found in vagal afferent endings in the esophagus, suggesting that glutamate is contained in, and probably released from, synaptic vesicles previously described in IGLEs. Functional evidence pending, this finding is in favor of a local effector function of IGLEs onto myenteric neurons.

AB A major QTL (quantitative trait locus) for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance, Qfhs.ndsu-3BS, derived from 'Sumai Y, has been identified and verified by several research groups via molecular marker analysis. Further study of this QTL is worthwhile because it explains a large portion (25-60%) of the variation in FHB resistance in the reported studies. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify additional molecular markers for Qfhs.ndsu-3BS, (ii) construct a cytologically based physical map of chromosome 3BS, and (iii) identify germplasm with novel FHB resistance genes with SSR markers near Qfhs.ndsu-3BS. Two new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (XBARC133 and XBARC102), two sequence tagged site (STS) markers (XSTS3B1 and Xsun2), and one restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marker (Xfbb185), were mapped to the Qfhs.ndsu-3BS region. On the basis of deletion line analysis, this major QTL is likely located on the deletion bin 3BS 0.78-0.87. Fifty-four FHB resistant lines from throughout the world and 20 North American spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines of historical prominence were genotyped by five SSR markers (Xgwm389, Xgwm533, XBARC133, Xgwm493, and XBARC102) associated with Qfhs.ndsu-3BS. The Sumai 3 haplotype is rare. Only 25 out of 54 FHB resistant lines and one North American spring wheat line have Sumai 3-type alleles for at least one of these five SSR markers. Twelve FHB resistant lines have the same SSR allele as Sumai 3 for at least four of the five SSR markers, and therefore most likely contain this major QTL. The other 42 FHB resistant lines may carry novel FHB resistance genes, and are worthy of further genetic study.

AB Fusarium head blight (FEB) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a devastating disease in wheat production worldwide. Identifying resistance genes and understanding the genetic basis of resistance to FHB are prerequisites to developing cultivars that can avoid losses from FHB. This investigation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was performed in a recombinant inbred (RI) population-derived from a cross between the FHB-moderately susceptible cv. Patterson and the FEB-resistant line Fundulea 201R (F201R). Bulk DNAs from the 11 most resistant and 12 most susceptible lines of the phenotypic distribution of the RI population, together with the parental lines, were screened with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Regional QTL mapping identified four interval regions, located on chromosomes 1B, 3A, 3D, and 5A, that conferred resistance to FHB. The QTLs located on chromosomes 1B and 3A, contributed by F201R, had large effects and were consistently expressedin three environments. The four QTLs together accounted for 32.7% of the phenotypic variation, or 43.0% of the genotypic variation. The QTL on chromosome 3A is located in the same region as a QTL that was detected in. wild tetraploid-wheat T. dicoccoides (Koern. ex Asch. & Graebner) Aarons. The possibility that the FHB resistance QTLs of F201R and that of T. dicoccoides on chromosome 3A have the same origin is discussed.

When using hygromycin as selective agent in a co-transformation experiment involving a mixture of plasmids pGL2, containing the hpt gene, and pAI(1)Gus, containing the uidA gene, 3 out of 19 transgenic wheat plants had the uidA gene alone as shown by Southern blots. The gene was transmitted to the progeny following Mendelian rules. Segregation and loss of the selectable marker gene was also found in three out of six events from other experiments where high-molecular-weight glutenin genes were expressed or over-expressed. On the other hand, in 7 experiments where no selective pressure was applied and that involved 1016 bombarded explants, 23 transgenic wheat plants were obtained. The uidA gene was stably integrated as suggested by its transmission to the progeny.

AB Cytoplasmatic male sterility (CMS) is the basis for commercial hybrid seed production of rye. Nuclear restorer genes are indispensable for a complete restoration of fertility of the CMS lines. The drawbacks of current European restorer lines require the utilisation of new genetic resources that have been recently detected in an Iranian primitive rye population (IRAN IX) and an Argentinean landrace (Pico Gentario). The introgression of these effective restorer genes (Rfp1 and Rfp2, respectively) into breeding material can be facilitated by marker-assisted selection. Using two F-2 populations based on crosses between the non-restorer inbred line Lo6 and the restorer IRAN IX, as well as Pico Gentario, RAPDs and AFLPs were screened and led to a closely linked marker set for each of these genes. The conversion of the closest markers into fragment-specific sequence-characterised amplified region (SCAR) markers resulted in flanking ranges of 2.9 cM (Rfp1) and 5.2 cM (Rfp2). The application of these markers in backcross programmes is discussed.

AB A new Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor Say) resistance gene from Aegilops triuncialis and its transfer to hexaploid wheat via interspecific hybridisation is described. The transfer line TR-3531 (42 chromosomes), derived from the cross [(Triticum turgidum x Ae. triuncialis) x Triticum aestivum] and carrying the Heterodera avenae resistance gene Cre7, showed a high level of resistance to the M. destructor biotype prevailing in the SW of Spain. A single dominant gene (H30) seems to determine the Hessian fly resistance in this introgression line, and its linkage with an isozyme marker (Acph-U1) has also been studied. It has been demonstrated that the resistance gene H30 in the TR-3531 line is non-allelic with respect to the genes H3, H6, H9, H11, H12, H13, H18 and H21, present in wheat cultivars from the Uniform Hessian Fly Nursery (UHFN), as well as to, H27, carried by the introgression line H-93-33. Advanced lines with the H30 gene were obtained by backcrossing the transfer line and different commercial wheats as recurrent parents. Several of them showed a high yield in tests carried out in the infested field.

As a prerequisite for a gene isolation via a map-based cloning approach, bulked segregant analysis followed by single plant analyses of over 200 homozygous individuals of a population of 476 F2 plants derived from a cross between 'DGV' (def wild-type) and 'PF' (def mutant), were used to detect markers closely linked to the def locus. The AFLP technique in combination with silver staining was used to maximize numbers of reproducible marker loci. Fifteen AFLP loci showed a genetic distance less than 5 and two of them less than 1 centiMorgans (cM) to the gene of interest. AFLPs were converted into sequence tagged sites (STSs) and into a newly refined AFLP-based single locus marker named the 'sequence specified AFLP' (ssAFLP).

AB The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm22, identified in the Italian wheat cultivar Virest and originally assigned to wheat chromosome 1D, was mapped to chromosome 7A with the aid of molecular markers. Mapping of common AFLP and SSR markers in two wheat crosses segregating for Pm22 and Pm1c, respectively, indicated that Pm22 is a member of the complex Pm1 locus. Pm22 also showed a pattern of resistance reaction to a differential set of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates that was distinguishable from those from other Pm1 alleles in lines Axminster/8*Cc (Pm1a), MocZlatka (Pm1b), Weihenstephan Stamm M1N (Pm1c) and Triticum spelta var. duhamelianum TRI 2258 (Pm1d). Based on these results, the gene symbol Pm1e is proposed for the powdery mildew resistance gene in cv. Virest.

DE Triticum aestivum; Pre-harvest sprouting; Seed dormancy; QTL mapping;

AB A major component of the observed genetic variation for pre-harvest sprouting in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) appears to be the level of seed dormancy. Group 3 chromosomes have received attention as carrying the R genes for seed-coat color and the taVp1 genes that are orthologous to the maize Vp1 gene which encode a dormancy-related transcription factor. The objectives of the present study were to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed dormancy on chromosome 3A and to investigate an association between taVp1 or R-A1 and the QTLs detected. A mapping population in the form of recombinant inbred lines developed from the cross between the highly dormant Zenkoujikomugi (Zen) and Chinese Spring (CS) was utilized. Nineteen marker loci, including taVp1, were mapped on chromosome 3A. The taVp1 locus was located in the middle of the long arm, about 85 cM from the centromere. The population was evaluated in duplicate by growing them under controlled environment conditions. Two QTLs for seed dormancy, designated as QPhs.ocs-3A.1 and QPhs.ocs-3A.2, were identified on the short and long arms, respectively. QPhs.ocs-1 explained 23-38% of the phenotypic variation and the Zen allele had a striking effect on maintaining dormancy. QPhs.ocs-2, with a minor effect, was detectable only at the dormancy-breaking stage. Although QPhs.ocs-2 was loosely linked to taVp1 by around 50 cM, they are clearly distinct genes. Zen and CS carry the white R-A1a allele, and no QTL effect was detected in the vicinity region of R-A1. Hence it was concluded that the high dormancy associated with chromosome 3A of Zen is ascribable to QPhs.ocs-1 on the short arm but is not due to the direct contribution of either the taVp1 or R-A1 locus.

AB In a few plant pathosystems, defeated major genes have been shown to contribute to partial resistance to disease. This hypothesis has never been tested before in a forest tree, but pathogenic variation associated with recent hybridization in poplar rust in the Pacific northwest provided an opportunity. An F-2 progeny of 256 poplar clones in the field near Corvallis, Oregon, USA, has been monitored for rust severity and infection type since the advent of the new hybrid rust, Melampsora x columbiana , in the mid-1990s. All 256 clones displayed a susceptible infection type in 1997 and again in 2000, and yet variation in uredinial density (i.e. partial resistance) was still observed. To determine which clones possessed a defeated resistance gene, a greenhouse inoculation was performed with an isolate of M. medusae , one of the parents of M . x columbiana . Clones that would have been resistant to M. medusae , prior to the advent of M . x columbiana , were thus identified. The inoculation resulted in a 1 : 1 segregation (chi(2)=0.772; p=0.38) for resistance, indicating the presence of a major gene. However, the F-2 clones possessing the defeated resistance gene displayed the same level of partial resistance in the field in both 1997 and 2000 as their full siblings lacking the gene.

AB A total of 1673 Mycosphaerella graminicola strains were assayed for DNA fingerprints and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The isolates were collected from 17 wheat fields located in I I countries on five continents over a six year period (1989-1995). Our results indicate that genetic diversity in the nuclear genome of this fungus was high for all but three of the field populations surveyed and that populations sampled from different continents had similar frequencies for the most common RFLP alleles. Hierarchical analysis revealed that more than 90% of global gene diversity was distributed within a wheat field, while similar to5% of gene diversity was distributed among fields within regions and similar to3% was distributed among regions on different continents. These findings suggest that gene flow has occurred on a global scale. On average, each leaf was colonized by a different nuclear genotype. In contrast, only seven mtDNA haplotypes were detected among the 1673 isolates and the two most common mtDNA haplotypes represented approximately 93% of the world population, consistent with a selective sweep. Analysis of multilocus associations indicated that all field populations were in gametic equilibrium, suggesting that sexual recombination is a regular occurrence globally.

AB The plant vp1 gene encodes a transcription factor originally identified in maize that participates in the control of the transition from embryogenesis to seed germination. Different lines of evidence suggest that vp1 participates in preharvest sprouting (PHS) resistance in cereals, but the genetic relationship is not yet established. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate if there is a connection between vp1 and the formerly documented quantitative trait loci for PHS in Sorghum bicolor. This gene was mapped in sorghum using two well-studied inbred lines displaying contrasting PHS phenotypes. Linkage analysis revealed that the S. bicolor vp1 (Sbvp1) locus is linked to markers located on chromosomes 3 and 8 in maize. Analysis indicated that this gene is not correlated with PHS at a statistically significant level. Structural analysis of the Sbvp1 gene from both inbred lines showed a high degree of overall conservation (low polymorphism), even in the promoter region. These findings, taken together with the previously observed correlation between the pattern of expression of this gene and PHS performance, suggest that Sbvp1 might act downstream in the signalling pathway that leads to seed germination, or even be differentially regulated as a consequence rather than as a cause of the phenotypic behaviour.

AB The grain hardness locus, Ha, is located at the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5D in wheat. Three polypeptides, puroindoline-a, puroindoline-b, and grain softness protein (GSP-1), have been identified as components of friabilin, a biochemical marker for grain softness, and the genes for these polypeptides are known to be tightly linked to the Ha locus. However, this region of the chromosome 5D has not been well characterized and the physical distance between the markers is not known. Separate lambda clones containing the puroindoline-a gene and the puroindoline-b gene have been isolated from an Aegilops tauschii (the donor of the D genome to wheat) genomic lambda library and investigated. Considerable variation appears to exist in the organization of the region upstream of the gene for puroindoline-b among species closely related to wheat. Using in situ hybridization the genes for puroindoline-a, -b, and GSP-1 were demonstrated to be physically located at the tip of the short arm of chromosome 5 of A. tauschii. Four overlapping clones were isolated from a large-insert BAC library constructed from A. tauschii and of these one contained genes for all of puroindoline-a, puroindoline-b, and GSP-1. The gene for puroindoline-a is located between the other two genes at a distance no greater than approximately 30 kb from either gene. The BAC clone containing all three known genes was used to screen a cDNA library constructed from hexaploid wheat and cDNAs that could encode novel polypeptides were isolated.

The presence of a B subunit of KKS 717-specific low-molecular-weight-glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) significantly enhanced the gluten strength. Although the C subunit showing a difference in mobility between Grandin and KKS 717 did not affect the gluten strength, the presence of this KKS 717-specific C subunit significantly decreased the gluten index in the absence of the KKS 717-specific B subunit. Using a LMW-GS locus-specific PCR primer set, we demonstrated that the B subunit of KKS 717-specific LMW-GS was encoded by the Glu-A3 locus. The use of this PCR primer set could be suitable for breeding programs aimed at improving the gluten quality.

AB This article presents selected results of a study carried out in Mexico at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) to compare the cost-effectiveness of conventional and marker-assisted maize breeding. Costs associated with use of conventional and marker-assisted selection (MAS) methods were estimated using a spreadsheet-based budgeting approach. This information was used to compare the cost of using conventional screening and MAS to achieve a well-defined breeding objective-identification of plants carrying a mutant recessive form of the opaque2 gene in maize that is associated with Quality Protein Maize (QPM). In addition to generating empirical cost information that will be of use to CIMMYT research managers, the study produced four important insights. First, for any given breeding project, detailed budget analysis will be needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of MAS relative to conventional selection. Second, direct comparisons of unit costs for MAS methods and conventional selection methods provide useful information for research managers, but factors other than cost are likely to play an important role in driving the choice of screening methods. Third, the choice between MAS and conventional selection may be complicated by the fact that the two are not always direct substitutes. Fourth, when used with empirical data from actual breeding programs, spreadsheet-based budgeting tools can be used by research managers to improve the efficiency of existing protocols and to inform decisions about future technology choices.

AB This article presents selected results of a study carried out in Mexico at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) to compare the cost-effectiveness of conventional and biotechnology-assisted maize breeding. Costs associated with the use of conventional and marker-assisted selection (MAS) methods at CIMMYT were estimated using a spreadsheet-based budgeting approach. This information was used to compare the costs of conventional and MAS methods for a particular breeding application: introgressing an elite allele at a single dominant gene into an elite maize line (line conversion). At CIMMYT, neither method shows clear superiority in terms of both cost and speed: conventional breeding schemes are less expensive, but MAS-based breeding schemes can be completed in less time. For applications involving tradeoffs between time and money, relative profitability can be evaluated using conventional investment theory. Using a simple model of a plant breeding program, we show that the optimal choice of a breeding technology depends on the availability of operating capital. If operating capital is abundantly available, the "best" breeding method will be the one that maximizes the net present value (i.e., MAS), but if operating capital is constrained, the "best" breeding method will be the one that maximizes the internal rate of return (i.e., conventional selection). This insight may help to explain why private firms tend to invest more aggressively in biotechnology than public breeding programs, which are more likely to face budgetary constraints.

AB The genus Septoria contains more than 1000 species of plant pathogenic fungi, most of which have no known sexual stage. Species of Septoria without a known sexual stage could be recent derivatives of sexual species that have lost the ability to mate. To test this hypothesis, the mating-type region of S. passerinii, a species with no known sexual stage, was cloned, sequenced, and compared to that of its close relative S. tritici (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella graminicola). Both of the S. passerinii mating-type idiomorphs were approximately 3 kb in size and contained a single reading frame interrupted by one (MAT-2) or two (MAT-1) putative introns. The putative products of MAT-1 and MAT-2 are characterized by alpha-box and high-mobility-group sequences, respectively, similar to those in the mating-type genes of M. graminicola and other fungi. The mating-type genes of S. passerinii and M. graminicola are evolving rapidly, approximately ten times faster than the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA, and are not closely related to those from Cochliobolus or other loculoascomycetes in the order Pleosporales. Therefore, the class Loculoascomycetes may be polyphyletic. Furthermore, differences between the phylogenetic trees may indicate separate evolutionary histories for the MAT-1 and MAT-2 idiomorphs. A three-primer multiplex-PCR technique was developed that allowed rapid identification of the mating types of isolates of S. passerinii. Both mating types were present in approximately equal frequencies and often on the same leaf in fields in Minnesota and North Dakota. Analyses with isozyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers revealed that each isolate had a unique genotype. The common occurrence of both mating types on the same leaf and the high levels of genotypic diversity indicate that S. passerinii is almost certainly not an asexual derivative of a sexual fungus. Instead, sexual reproduction probably plays an integral role in the life cycle of S. passerinii and may be much more important than previously believed in this (and possibly other) "asexual" species of Septoria.

AB The length of chromosomal segments retained around the Vrn-B1 gene controlling sensitivity to vernalization in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was studied in the first and third backcrosses by using microsatellite markers. Eleven polymorphic markers located on chromosome 5B were used for microsatellite analysis. It was shown in the first backcross that plants with a donor segment around the gene of interest not longer than 50% of chromosome 5B could be selected. When selection is not molecular-marker assisted, the length of the chromosomal donor segment with the target gene may reach 94% of chromosome 5B even in plants of the third backcross generation. The considerable length differences in the 5B microsatellite loci between the winter and spring lines of wheat studied indicate that these markers are promising in marker-assisted backcrossing or marker-assisted selection for the Vrn-B1 gene using different combinations of Spring and Winter genotypes.

AB The CO (CONSTANS) gene of Arabidopsis has an important role in the regulation of flowering by photoperiod. CO is part of a gene family with 17 members that are subdivided into three classes, termed Group I to III here. All members of the family have a CCT (CO, CO-like, TOC1) domain near the carboxy terminus. Group I genes, which include CO, have two zinc finger B-boxes near the amino terminus. Group 11 genes have one B-box, and Group III genes have one B-box and a second diverged zinc finger. Analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequence identified 16 genes (OsA-OsP) that were also divided into these three groups, showing that their evolution predates monocot/dicot divergence. Eight Group I genes (HvCO1-HvCO8) were isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare), of which two (HvCO1 and HvCO2) were highly CO like. HvCO3 and its rice counterpart (OsB) had one B-box that was distantly related to Group II genes and was probably derived by internal deletion of a two B-box Group I gene. Sequence homology and comparative mapping showed that HvCO1 was the counterpart of OsA (Hd1), a major determinant of photoperiod sensitivity in rice. Major genes determining photoperiod response have been mapped in barley and wheat (Triticum aestivum), but none corresponded to CO-like genes. Thus, selection for variation in photoperiod response has affected different genes in rice and temperate cereals. The peptides of HvCO1, HvCO2 (barley), and Hd1 (rice) show significant structural differences from CO, particularly amino acid changes that are predicted to abolish B-box2 function, suggesting an evolutionary trend toward a one-B-box structure in the most CO-like cereal genes.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium culmorum is an economically important disease of wheat that may cause serious yield and quality losses under favorable climate conditions. The development of disease-resistant cultivars is the most effective control strategy. Worldwide, there is heavy reliance on the resistance pool originating from Asian wheats, but excellent field resistance has also been observed among European winter wheats. The objective of this study was to map and characterize quantitative traits loci (QTL) of resistance to FHB among European winter wheats. A population of 194 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was genotyped from a cross between two winter wheats Renan (resistant)/Recital (susceptible) with microsatellites, AFLP and RFLP markers. RILs were assessed under field conditions For 3 years in one location. Nine QTLs were detected, and together they explained 30-45% of the variance, depending on the year. Three of the QTLs were stable over the 3 years. One stable QTL, QFhs.inra.2b, was mapped to chromosome 2B and two QTLs QFhs.inra.5a2 and QFhs.inra.5a3, to chromosome 5A; each of these QTLs explained 6.9-18.6% of the variance. Other QTLs were identified on chromosome 2A, 3A, 3B, 5D, and 6D, but these had a smaller effect on FHB resistance. One of the two QTLs on chromosome 5A was linked to gene B1 controlling the presence of awns. Overlapping QTLs for FHB resistance were those for plant height or/and flowering time. Our results confirm that wheat chromosomes 2A, 3A, 3B, and 5A carry FHB resistance genes, and new resistance factors were identified on chromosome arms 2BS and 5AL. Markers flanking these QTLs should be useful tools for combining the resistance to FHB of Asian and European wheats to increase the resistance level of cultivars.

AB Large-scale field screening for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat is difficult because environmental factors strongly influences the expression of resistance genes. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) may provide a powerful alternative. Conversion of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers into sequence-tagged site (STS) markers can generate breeder-friendly markers for MAS. In a previous study, one major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3BS was identified by using EcoRI-AFLP and a recombinant inbred population derived from the cross Ning 7840/Clark. Further mapping with PstI-AFLPs identified five markers that were significantly associated with the QTL. Three of them individually explained 38% to 50% of the phenotypic variation for FHB resistance. Two of them (pAGT/mCTG57, pACT/mCTG136) were linked to the QTL in coupling, and another (pAG/mCAA244) was linked to the QTL in repulsion. Successful conversion of one AFLP marker (pAG/mCAA244) yielded a co-dominant STS marker that explains about 50% of the phenotypic variation for FHB resistance in the population. The STS was validated in 14 other cultivars and is the first STS marker for a FHB resistance QTL converted from an AFLP marker.

AB During the past decade Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe has resulted in severe grain yield and quality losses of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Northern Great Plains of the U.S. Given the complexity of breeding for FHB resistance, molecular markers associated with this trait will be valuable in accelerating efforts to breed resistant cultivars. The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance in wheat using a set of lines obtained by several cycles of crossing to North Dakota adapted genotypes, which derived their resistance from cv. Sumai 3. Microsatellite markers spanning the wheat genome were used to screen parents and derived lines. Polymorphisms for parental alleles were compared to disease scores for Type II resistance. The probability of linkage between markers and introgressed resistance genes was calculated using a binomial probability formula based on the assumption that a molecular marker at a specific distance from the introgressed gene, in a near-isogenic line (NIL), will carry the donor-parent allele as a function of the distance between marker and gene and the number of backcrosses/selfs performed in deriving the NIL. Microsatellite loci Xgwm533 and Xgwm274 were significantly associated with QTL for FHB resistance.

AB Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers have been used to characterize the genetic diversity among 35 spring wheat cultivars and lines with different levels of Fusarium resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine RAPD-based genetic similarity between accessions and to derive associations between Fusarium head blight (FHB) and RAPD markers. Two bulked DNA from either highly resistant lines or susceptible lines were used to screen polymorphic primers. Out of 160 screened primers, 17 primers generated reproducible and polymorphic fragments. Genetic similarity calculated from the RAPD data ranged from 0.64 to 0.98. A dendrogram was prepared on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm, which corresponded well with the results of principal component analysis and separated the 35 genotypes into two groups. Association analysis between RAPD markers and the FHB index detected three RAPD markers, H19(1000), F2(500) and B1(2400), significantly associated with FHB-resistant genotypes. These results suggest that a collection of unrelated genotypes can be used to identify markers linked to an agronomically important quantitative trait like FHB. These markers will be useful for marker-assistant breeding and can be used as candidate markers for further gene mapping and cloning.

AB A cDNA clone encoding the gamma-zein protein of maize was expressed in developing grain of barley using the starchy endosperm cell-specific promoter from the wheat Glu-1D-1 (HMW subunit 1Dx5) gene. Seven transgenic lines were recovered from 226 bombarded immature embryos, of which two were sterile and four tetraploid, while five were shown to express the gamma-zein protein based on western blotting. Southern blot analysis showed the presence of between about three and twelve transgene insertions. Detailed comparative studies of five null and five homozygous transformed sub-lines from transgenic line A showed that gamma-zein accounted for over 4% of the total prolamin fraction, corresponding to about 1.9% of the total grain N. Comparison of the proteins present in the gel protein fraction demonstrated that the gamma-zein was incorporated into polymers, as in maize. However, there was no effect on grain hardness measured using the Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System or on the vitreousness measured by visual inspection. This contrasts with the situation in maize where a clear association with vitreousness has been reported.

AB The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) producing region of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) is subject to periods of water deficit during sowing and grain filling. Improving the genetic adaptation of wheat to drought stress represents one of the main objectives of regional breeding programs. One biochemical response to dehydrative stress is the accumulation of a family of proteins called dehydrins, which are believed to protect membranes and macromolecules against denaturation. Although previous studies demonstrated the accumulation of dehydrins in drought-stressed wheat, little was known about the relation of dehydrin expression to acquisition of drought tolerance in specific varieties adapted to the PNW. We characterized dehydrin accumulation during the exposure of seven cultivars ('Connie', 'Gene', 'TAM105', 'Rod', 'Hiller', 'Rhode', and 'Stephens') to progressive drought stress in four separate experiments. The objective was to identify differences in the nature or timing of dehydrin expression in these cultivars and to learn whether dehydrin expression was associated with the acquisition of stress tolerance during seedling development. Expression of a 24-kDa dehydrin was observed in Connie, TAM105, and Gene after 4 d of stress and at subsequent sampling dates while no dehydrins were detected in nonstress control plants. Dehydrin expression was significantly delayed in the remaining cultivars. The presence of this dehydrin was related to acquisition of drought tolerance characterized by a greater maintenance of shoot dry matter production in Connie, TAM105, and Gene. Although the role of these proteins remains unknown, their association with stress tolerance suggests that dehydrins might be used to improve the adaptation to drought.

AB To diversify the genetic base of resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to the wheat curl mite (WCM), A ceria tosichella Keifer, resistance to this pest was transferred from the dipolid goatgrass Aegilops taushcii (Coss.). Schmal. to the hard red winter wheat germplasm KS96-WGRC40 by backcrossing to the cultivar TAM 107. KS96WGRC40 has WCM resistance derived from both Ae. tauschii and rye (Secale cereale L.). The objectives of this study were to determine if a unique WCM resistance gene was transferred from Ae. tauschii to KS96WGRC40 and to determine the chromosome and linkage map locations of the WCM resistance genes in the germplasm. The rye-derived WCM resistance gene in TAM 107 and KS96WGRC40, designated Cmc3, is present on wheat-rye translocation T1AL-1RS. Marker analysis of a segregating F-2 population revealed that the rye-specific micro-satellite marker SCM09 can be used to select wheat lines carrying the 1RS segment and Cmc3. Allelism tests indicated that the Ae. tauschii-derived WCM resistance gene in KS96WGRC40, designated Cmc4, segregated independently of the Cmc1 gene previously transferred from this species. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses located Cmc4 distally on chromosome 6DS flanked by markers Xgdm141 (4.1 centimorgans, cM) and XksuG8 (6.4 cM). The linked markers may be used in wheat breeding programs for the selection of lines resistant to WCM and for gene pyramiding.

AB Durable disease resistance may be achieved by pyramiding multiple qualitative resistance genes in single genotypes and by using quantitative resistance (QR) genes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis tools can be used to rind determinants of QR. Resistance QTL pyramids may also lead to durable resistance, and they provide independent validation of QTL effects and QTL interactions. We used molecular markers to identify allelic architectures at three previously mapped QTL conferring resistance to barley stripe rust (caused by Paccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. hordei) in a set of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare) doubled haploid (DH) lines. The three QTL are located on three different chromosomes. One parent contributed the resistance alleles at two QTL and another parent contributed the resistance allele at the third QTL. In this report, we focus on resistance at the seedling stage; resistance at the adult plant stage will be addressed in a future report. The DH population was phenotyped for resistance by means of four pathogen isolates that show different patterns of virulence on a set of differentials. We used molecular markers to infer the resistance QTL allele architecture of each DH line. There was no significant QTL X race interaction, although some DH lines showed differential responses to isolates. The effects and locations of two QTL, each tracing to a different parent, were validated. The third QTL did not have a significant effect on disease symptom expression. To maximize the probability of recovering the resistant phenotype, resistance alleles are necessary at both QTL.

AB Conserved motifs within resistance genes have been utilized in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies to isolate resistance gene analogs (RGAs) and resistance gene-like (RGLs) sequences from many plant species. RGAs have the potential to serve as closely linked markers for marker-assisted breeding or even as resistance gene candidates. The objectives of this study were to clone, sequence, and map RGAs and kinase analogs (KA). Three motifs in nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance genes and two conserved motifs within R-gene kinases were used to design degenerate primers and amplify RGAs and KAs from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Eight NBS-LRR and 26 KAs were isolated. The clones were physically mapped to chromosomes by means of wheat nulli-tetrasomic lines. The probes detected 137 fragments that could be assigned to 20 of the 21 chromosomes; nearly half of the fragments mapped in the B genome. None of the fragments mapped to chromosome 4D. Genetic mapping of clones showed simple and complex loci indicating both single and multigene families. The RGAs and KAs will be useful as markers for mapping resistance gene loci.

AB Genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR-) proteins isolated from a cDNA library of Fusarium graminearum-infected wheat spikes of scab-resistant cultivar 'Sumai-3' were transformed into susceptible spring wheat, 'Bobwhite' using a biolistic transformation protocol, with the goal of enhancing levels of resistance against scab. Twenty-four putative transgenic lines expressing either a single PR-protein gene or combinations thereof were regenerated. Transgene expression in a majority of these lines (20) was completely silenced in the T-1 or T-2 generations. Four transgenic wheat lines showed stable inheritance and expression of either a single transgene or transgene combinations up to four generations. One line co-expressing a chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase gene combination, when bioassayed against scab showed a delay in the spread of the infection (type II resistance) under greenhouse conditions. This line and a second transgenic line expressing a rice thaumatin-like protein gene (tip) which had moderate resistance to scab in previous greenhouse trials, along with susceptible and resistance checks were evaluated for resistance to scab under field conditions. None of the transgenic lines had resistance to scab in the field under conditions of strong pathogen, suggesting these plants lacked effective resistance to initial infection (type I resistance) under these conditions. As far as is known, this is the first report of field evaluation of transgenic. wheat expressing genes for PR-proteins against disease resistance.

AB The development of a robust Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol for a recalcitrant species like bread wheat requires the identification and optimisation of the factors affecting T-DNA delivery and plant regeneration. We have used immature embryos from range of wheat varieties and the Agrobacterium strain AGLI harbouring the pGreen-based plasmid pAL156, which contains a T-DNA incorporating the bar gene and a modified uidA (beta-glucuronidase) gene, to investigate and optimise major T-DNA delivery and tissue culture variables. Factors that produced significant differences in T-DNA delivery and regeneration included embryo size, duration of pre-culture, inoculation and co-cultivation, and the presence of acetosyringone and Silwet-L77 in the media. We fully describe a protocol that allowed efficient T-DNA delivery and gave rise to 44 morphologically normal, and fully fertile, stable transgenic plants in two wheat varieties. The transformation frequency ranged from 0.3% to 3.3%. Marker-gene expression and molecular analysis demonstrated that transgenes were integrated into the wheat genome and subsequently transmitted into progeny at Mendelian ratios.

AB In 1997 and 1998 we used samples of harvested grain to verify the possibility of distinguishing 14 winter wheat genotypes and six triticale genotypes and detecting the impurity on the basis of the detection of polymorphism of prolamin kernel proteins using the methods of the PAGE ISTA. On the basis of the identity index two sister prolamin lines with different percentage of participation, which was based on the weather conditions of the year of harvest, were discovered in seven wheat genotypes (Astella, Brea, Hana, Ilona, Siria, Sofia and Sarka) and two triticale genotypes (Tornado and KM 779). A foreign genotype was detected in the Hana and Astella varieties. The identity index of the impurity to the Astella and Hana variety (i.e. ii = 0.28 and ii = 0.20, respectively) was considerably lower. In an unknown genotype (impurity) we detected the gliadin block Gld IB3, which is the genetic marker of rye translocation T1BL.1RS, the Sr31 gene of resistance to black rust, higher cold resistance and the marker of poor baking quality (presence of secalin genes). The results proved the potential practical application of the method of electrophoretic detection of polymorphism of prolamin proteins as markers of impurities of foreign genotypes in a seed sample.

AB To explore the relationship between fine chromosome deletion and protein expression in common wheat, the changes in protein composition of wheat seed proteome were investigated by using chromosome 1B. A momosomic alien chromosome addition line of common wheat was used to produce the fine deletion lines. Endosperm and embryo proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and visualized by staining with Commassie Brilliant Blue, and gel images were analyzed with a computer assisted image analyzer. For the first time, fine gene locations of a few endosperm and embryo proteins were identified on the chromosome 1B. These proteins with their specific gene location on the chromosome can be used as protein markers in breeding programs for quality of wheat proteins. To identify wheat seed proteins and to understand their expression in relation to chromosome deletion, the feasibility of a new analytical approach based on isotope coded affinity tag labeling (ICAT) of peptides in tryptic digests followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been described. Simplification of the complex tryptic digest prior to mass spectral analysis was performed by treating the samples with light and heavy ICAT labeling reagents. A clear separation of peptide fragment containing the light and heavy reagents was achieved in mass spectral analysis. Out of the 14 peptides detected by mass fragment analysis of the euploid, four were down-regulated, nine up-regulated and one did not show any change due to the terminal deletion of chromosome 1B. Selected peptide fragments were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis for sequence information and the resulting sequence information was submitted to databases for protein identification. Of the five proteins submitted, four were identified as alpha-amylase inhibitor, alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor precursor, proteasome subunit alpha-type 7 and 1,4 alpha-glucan-D-maltohydrolase. With this approach it is possible to identify wheat seed proteins and to understand their expression, which have been reported to be difficult by 2-DE due to, cosynthesis of proteins by genes from three genomes, A, B and D.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Erysiphe graminis DM f. sp. tritici (Em. Marchal), is one of the most important diseases of common wheat world-wide. Chinese wheat variety 'Fuzhuang 30' carries the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm5e and has proven to be a valuable resistance source of powdery mildew for wheat breeding. Microsatellite markers were employed to identify the gene Pm5e in a F-2 progeny from the cross 'Nongda 15' (susceptible) x 'Fuzhuang 30' (resistant). The gene Pm5e was mapped in the distal region of chromosome 7BL. Seven microsatellite markers were found to be linked to the gene Pm5e, of which two codominant markers Xgwm783 and Xgwm1267 were relatively close to Pm5e with a linkage distance of 11.0 cM and 6.6 cM, respectively. It is possible to use the 136-bp allele of Xgwm1267 in 'Fuzhuang 30' for marker-assisted selection during the wheat resistance breeding process for facilitation of gene pyramiding. The mapping information in the present study provides a starting point for fine mapping of the Pm5 locus and map-based cloning to clarify the molecular structure and function of the different alleles at the Pm5 locus. A microsatellite linkage map of chromosome 7B was constructed with 20 microsatellite loci, nine on the short arm and 11 on the long arm. This information will be very useful for further mapping of agronomically important genes of interest on chromosome 7B.

AB Leaf rust is the most common disease in wheat production. There are more than 45 specific resistance genes described and used in wheat breeding to control epidemics of leaf rust, but none of them has been cloned. The leaf rust disease resistance gene 1 (Lrl) is a good model gene for isolation by map-based cloning because it is a single, dominant gene which is located in the distal region of chromosome 5DL of wheat. As the first step towards the isolation of this gene we constructed a high-resolution genetic map in the region of the Lrl locus by saturation mapping of two large segregating F-2 populations (ThatcherLrl x Thatcher, ThatcherLrl x Frisal). The resistance gene Lrl was delimited in a 0.16-cM region between the RFLP markers ABC718 and PSR567 (0.12 cM from ABC718 and 0.04 cM from PSR567). A genomic BAC library of Aegilops tauschii (D genome) was screened using the RFLP markers ABC718 and PSR567. Five positive BAC clones were identified by ABC718 and four clones by PSR567. Two NBS-LRR type of resistance gene analogs, which encode proteins highly homologous to the bacterial blight disease resistance protein Xal of rice, were identified on BAC clones isolated with PSR567. Polymorphic BAC end probes were isolated from both ends of a 105-kb large BAC clone identified by ABC718. The end probes were mapped at the same locus as ABC718, and no recombination event was found within 105 kb around ABC718 in our analysis of more than 4,000 gametes.

AB We describe a flexible and general strategy for converting a wheat RFLP-based assay into a PCR-based sequence-tagged site (STS), and have applied it to derive markers for a powdery mildew resistance gene present in a wheat-rye translocation. The concept is based on deriving PCR primers that amplify all of the homoeoloci defined by a single-copy cDNA sequence, and separating the resulting mixture of homoeoamplicons via single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gels, which are able to detect minor differences between related DNA sequences. After their separation, the individual homoeoamplicons were sequenced and these were used to define nucleotide polymorphisms that could be exploited to design locus-specific PCR primers. In one case, we were able to demonstrate that the assay was allele specific.

AB Nitrogen uptake and metabolism are central for vegetative and reproductive plant growth. This is reflected by the fact that nitrogen can be remobilized and reused within a plant, and this process is crucial for yield in most annual crops. A population of 146 recombinant inbred barley lines (F-8 and F-9 plants, grown in 2000 and 2001), derived from a cross between two varieties differing markedly in grain protein concentration, was used to compare the location of QTL associated with nitrogen uptake, storage and remobilization in flag leaves relative to QTL controlling developmental parameters and grain protein accumulation. Overlaps of support intervals for such QTL were found on several chromosomes, with chromosomes 3 and 6 being especially important. For QTL on these chromosomes, alleles associated with inefficient N remobilization were associated with depressed yield and higher levels of total or soluble organic nitrogen during grain filling and vice versa; therefore, genes directly involved in N recycling or genes regulating N recycling may be located on these chromosomes. Interestingly, the most prominent QTL for grain protein concentration (on chromosome 6) did not co-localize with QTL for nitrogen remobilization. However, QTL peaks for nitrate and soluble organic nitrogen were detected at this locus for plants grown in 2001 (but not in 2000). For these, alleles associated with low grain protein concentration were associated with higher soluble nitrogen levels in leaves during grain filling; therefore, gene(s) found at this locus might influence the nitrogen sink strength of developing barley grains.

AB Leaf and stripe rusts, caused by Puccinia triticina and P. striiformis, respectively, are globally important fungal diseases of wheat that cause significant annual yield losses. A gene that confers slow rusting resistance to leaf rust, designated as Lr46, has recently been located on wheat chromosome 1B. The objectives of our study were to establish the precise genomic location of gene Lr46 using molecular approaches and to determine if there was an association of this locus with adult plant ;resistance to stripe rust. A population of 146 F-5 and F-6 lines produced from the cross of susceptible 'Avocet S' with resistant 'Pavon 76' was developed and classified for leaf rust and stripe rust severity for three seasons. Using patterns of segregation for the two diseases, we estimated that at least two genes with additive effects conferred resistance to leaf rust and three to four genes conferred resistance to stripe rust. Bulked segregant analysis and linkage mapping using amplified fragment length polymorphisms with the 'Avocet' x 'Pavon 76' population, F-3 progeny lines of a single chromosome recombinant line population from the cross 'Lalbahadur' x 'Lalbahadur (Pavon 1B)', and the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative population established the genomic location of Lr46 at the distal end of the long arm of wheat chromosome I B. A gene that is closely linked to Lr46 and confers moderate levels of adult plant resistance to stripe rust is identified and designated as Yr29.

AB The objectives of this study were to validate the major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for scab resistance on the short arm of chromosome 3B in bread wheat and to isolate near-isogenic lines for this QTL using marker-assisted selection (MAS). Two resistant by susceptible populations, both using 'Ning7840' as the source of resistance, were developed to examine the effect of the 3BS QTL in different genetic backgrounds. Data for scab resistance and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers linked to the resistance QTL were analyzed in the F (2 :3) lines of one population and in the F (3 :4) lines of the other. Markers linked to the major QTL on chromosome 3BS in the original mapping population ('Ning7840'/'Clark') were closely associated with scab resistance in both validation populations. Marker-assisted selection for the QTL with the SSR markers combined with phenotypic selection was more effective than selection based solely on phenotypic evaluation in early generations. Marker-assisted selection of the major QTL during the seedling stage plus phenotypic selection after flowering effectively identified scab resistant lines in this experiment. Near-isogenic lines for this 3BS QTL were isolated from the F (6) generation of the cross 'Ning7840'/'IL89-7978' based on two flanking SSR markers, Xgwm389 and Xbarc147 . Based on these results, MAS for the major scab resistance QTL can improve selection efficiency and may facilitate stacking of scab resistance genes from different sources.

AB YLM, a codominant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) marker linked to Yd2 , could substantially improve the precision and efficiency of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance breeding. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of YLM in a marker-assisted introgression programme and to quantify associations between the presence of Yd2 and other agronomic and quality traits. The Yd2 gene was introgressed into a BYDV-susceptible background through two cycles of marker-assisted backcrossing. BC2 F-2 -derived lines, either carrying or not carrying the YLM allele associated with resistance, were compared in the presence and absence of BYDV. The YLM marker was shown to be effective in the introgression of Yd2 . Lines carrying the YLM allele associated with resistance produced significantly fewer leaf symptoms and showed a reduction in yield loss when infected with BYDV. There were no deleterious effects associated with the introgression of Yd2 on grain yield, grain size or malting quality. The implications of marker-assisted selection for Yd2 on barley improvement are discussed.

AB Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers linked to the Aegilops ventricosa -derived chromosome segment in 'VPM1' on which the eyespot resistance gene, Pch1 , and the endopeptidase gene, Ep-D1b , occur were identified. One marker was isolated from the gel, cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed a microsatellite repeat motif. Sequence-specific primers were designed to amplify a product containing the repeat motif, and the microsatellite marker was tested for cosegregation with the Ep-D1b allele. Distinct alleles were produced by the Pch1 sources, normal wheat and wheat containing the Lr19 translocation. A recombination frequency of 0.02 was calculated between the microsatellite marker and Ep-D1 .

AB A novel constitutive promoter from the maize histone H2B gene was recently identified. In this study, we characterised H2B promoter activity in both wheat and maize tissues using the gusA reporter gene and two synthetic versions of the pat (phosphinothricin acetyl transferase) selectable marker gene, namely mopat and popat. Analyses of transgenic plants showed that the H2B promoter is able to drive the expression of gusA to strong, constitutive levels in wheat and maize tissues. Using an H2B:mopat construct and phosphinothricin selection, we recovered transgenic wheat plants at efficiencies ranging from 0.3% to 7.4% (mean 1.6%), and the efficiency of selection ranged from 40% to 100% (mean 77.7%). In another application, H2B was combined with the maize Ubi-1 or the maize Adh-1 intron to drive the expression of mopat and popat. Transformation efficiencies with the Ubi-1 intron were between 1.4- to 16-fold greater than with the Adh-1 intron. However, the use of either of the introns was necessary for the recovery of transgenic plants. Mopat gave higher transformation efficiencies and induced higher levels of PAT protein in maize tissues than popat.

AB In bread wheat, QTL interval mapping for four growth characters (early growth habit, days to heading, days to maturity and plant height), and association studies for two leaf characters (leaf colour and leaf waxiness) were conducted utilising the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative reference population (ITMIpop) that was used in a number of earlier studies on molecular mapping in this crop. Using QTL Cartographer, composite interval mapping (CIM) for all the four growth characters and multitrait composite interval mapping (MCIM) for three correlated traits (excluding plant height) were conducted. For growth characters, CIM suggested the presence of 16 QTL (LOD = 2.0-12.7), of which only six were common with those among the 18 QTL identified by MCIM. This suggested possible presence of some false positives among QTL identified by CIM. Fourteen (14) molecular markers that were closest to the 14 QTL identified by CIM were also tested for marker-trait association using regression and t-tests. Five markers showed significant association, and therefore, are recommended for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Incidentally, the QTL associated with these five markers were identified by both CIM and MCIM thus placing higher level of confidence in these markers. Some of the QTL identified by CIM and joint MCIM also affected more than one trait each, suggesting that the observed correlation may be either due to tight linkage or due to pleiotropy. During CIM for individual traits, effects of all QTL (phenotypic variations explained or PVE) that were identified at LOD score of 2.0 or above, together accounted for approximately 17-91% of the phenotypic variation. However QTL effects, when measured irrespective of LOD score, exhibited characteristic L-shaped distribution, suggesting that there are many minor QTL, which should be taken into account during MAS. The two leaf characters exhibited 100% correlation. Consequently, the 14 markers that were identified showed significant marker-trait association with both the traits. Some of these markers are the same, which also exhibited association with some growth and yield traits, studied by us earlier, thus adding to their utility in wheat breeding through MAS.

AB We analyzed the ecological-genomic diversity of microsatellites of wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum (C. Koch) Thell., at 18 loci in 306 individuals of 16 populations from Jordan across a southward transect of increasing aridity. The 18 microsatellites revealed a total of 249 alleles, with an average of 13.8 alleles per locus (range 3-29), with nonrandom distribution. The proportion of polymorphic loci per population averaged 0.91 (range 0.83-1.00); gene diversity, He, averaged 0.512 (range 0.38-0.651). We compared the number of alleles of the 18 loci to those found in Israel populations by Turpeinen et al.. Out of the 280 alleles, 138 (49.3%) were unique (i.e. occurred in only one of the countries). The percentage of unique alleles in Jordan and Israel populations was 43.0% and 17.9%, respectively, suggesting that Jordan is an important center of origin and diversity of wild barley. Estimates of mean gene diversity were highest in the populations collected near the Golan Heights, such as Shuni North, Shuni South and Jarash. Sixty nine percent of the microsatellite variation was partitioned within populations and 31% between populations. Associations between ecogeographical values and gene diversity were established for eight microsatellite loci. The cluster produced by simple sequence repeat (SSR) data is mostly coincidence with the result of the dendrogram of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies of subterranean mole rats in Jordan based on allozyme gene loci. The major soil type in the wild barley habitat of each ecological group was different. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the variance of gene diversity was explained by altitude (R-2 = 0.362**). These observations suggest that microsatellites are at least partly adaptive and subject to natural selection.

AB A software tool was developed for the identification of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) EST (expressed sequence tag) database comprising 24,595 sequences. In total, 1,856 SSR-containing sequences were identified. Trimeric SSR repeat motifs appeared to be the most abundant type. A subset of 311 primer pairs flanking SSR loci have been used for screening polymorphisms among six barley cultivars, being parents of three mapping populations. As a result, 76 EST-derived SSR-markers were integrated into a barley genetic consensus map. A correlation between polymorphism and the number of repeats was observed for SSRs built of dimeric up to tetrameric units. 3'-ESTs yielded a higher portion of polymorphic SSRs (64%) than 5'-ESTs did. The estimated PIC (polymorphic information content) value was 0.45 +/- 0.03. Approximately 80% of the SSR-markers amplified DNA fragments in Hordeum bulbosum, followed by rye, wheat (both about 60%) and rice (40%). A subset of 38 EST-derived SSR-markers comprising 114 alleles were used to investigate genetic diversity among 54 barley cultivars. In accordance with a previous, RFLP-based, study, spring and winter cultivars, as well as two- and six-rowed barleys, formed separate clades upon PCoA analysis. The results show that: (1) with the software tool developed, EST databases can be efficiently exploited for the development of cDNA-SSRs, (2) EST-derived SSRs are significantly less polymorphic than those derived from genomic regions, (3) a considerable portion of the developed SSRs can be transferred to related species, and (4) compared to RFLP-markers, cDNA-SSRs yield similar patterns of genetic diversity.

Based on F-2 segregation of the crosses between CMS and the restoring lines, the testcrosses and F-1 x F-1 populations, together with RAPD and SSR mapping, one dominant gene was identified to control the CMS fertility restoration in cotton. The strategy of genotype representation analysis (GRA) was put forward to screen the markers linked with the Rf(1) locus. Using 1,025 random decamer primers and 282 pairs of SSR primers, two RAPD and three SSR markers were identified to be closely linked to the Rf(1) gene. Among the five markers, three were co-dominantly inherited. Additionally, based on the analysis of monosomic and telesomic lines with one SSR maker, the Rf(1) locus could be located on the long arm of chromosome 4. The molecular markers available here are helpful in the development of the elite restoring lines in cotton by marker-assisted selection.

AB We made an update of the intervarietal molecular marker linkage map of the wheat genome developed using a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between the cultivars 'Courtot' and 'Chinese Spring'. This map was constructed using 187 DH lines and 659 markers. The genome was well covered (more than 95%) except for chromosomes from homoeologous group 4 and chromosomes 5D and 7D, which had gaps slightly larger than 50 cM. A core-map based on a set of 200 anchor loci (one marker each 18.4 cM) was developed. The total length of this map was 3,685 cM which is similar to the size of the international reference map of the ITMI population (3,551 cM). Map coverage was identical for the three genomes (A, B and D) and for the number of anchor loci, as well as for the size of the map. Using this map, QTLs for several agronomic traits were detected on phenotypic data from the population grown in Clermont-Ferrand (France) under natural field conditions over 6 years, and in Norwich (UK) in controlled conditions and under natural field conditions in 1 year. Almost all of the 21 chromosomes were involved in at least one trait. However, several regions seemed to contain gene clusters either for grain traits (and thus breadmaking quality) or plant development traits.

AB This study was conducted to identify and map the quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling Al tolerance in rice using molecular markers. A population of 171 F-6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Oryza sativa (IR64), the Al susceptible parent, and Oryza rufipogon, the Al tolerant parent, was evaluated for Al tolerance using a nutrient solution with and without 40 ppm of active Al+3. A genetic map, consisting of 151 molecular markers covering 1,755 cM with an average distance of 11.6 cM between loci, was constructed. Nine QTLs were dentified including one for root length under non-stress conditions (CRL), three for root length under Al stress (SRL) and five for relative root length (RRL). O. rufipogon contributed favorable alleles for each of the five QTLs for RRL, which is a primary parameter for Al tolerance, and individually they explained 9.0-24.9% of the phenotypic variation. Epistatic analysis revealed that CRL was conditioned by an epistatic effect, whereas SRL and RRL were controlled by additive effects. Comparative genetic analysis showed that QTLs for RRL, which mapped on chromosomes 1 and 9, appear to be consistent among different rice populations. Interestingly, a major QTL for RRL, which explained 24.9% of the phenotypic variation, was found on chromosome 3 of rice, which is conserved across cereal species. These results indicate the possibilities to use marker-assisted selection and pyramiding QTLs for enhancing Al tolerance in rice. Positional cloning of such QTLs introgressed from O. rufipogon will provide a better understanding of the Al tolerance mechanism in rice and the evolutionary genetics of plant adaptation to acid-soil conditions across cereal species.

AB The Yr5 gene confers resistance to all races of the stripe rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) of wheat in the United States. To develop molecular markers for Yr5, a BC7:F-3 population was developed by backcrossing the Yr5 donor 'Triticum spelta album' (TSA) with the recurrent parent 'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS). Seedlings of the Yr5 near-isogenic lines (AVS/6*Yr5), AVS, TSA, and the BC7:F-3 lines were tested with North American races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici under controlled greenhouse conditions. The single gene was confirmed by a 1:2:1 segregation ratio for homozygous-resistant, heterozygous and homozygous-susceptible BC7:F-3 lines. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents (the Yr5 near-isogenic line and AVS) and 202 BC7:F-3 lines. The resistance gene-analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique was used to identify molecular markers. The parents and the homozygous-resistant and homozygous-susceptible BC7:F-3 bulks were used to identify putative RGAP markers for Yr5. Association of the markers with Yr5 was determined using segregation analysis with DNA from the individual BC7:F-3 lines. Of 16 RGAP markers confirmed by segregation analysis with 109 BC7:F-3 lines, and nine of the markers confirmed with an additional 93 BC7:F-3 lines, three markers co-segregated with the resistance allele and three markers co-segregated with the susceptibility allele at the Yr5 locus. The other four markers were tightly linked to the locus. Analysis of a set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines with three markers that co-segregated with, or were linked to, the susceptibility allele confirmed that the Yr5 locus is on chromosome 2B. Of five RGAP markers that were cloned and sequenced, markers Xwgp-17 and Xwgp-18 that co-segregated with the Yr5 locus were co-dominant and had 98% homology with each other in both DNA and translated amino-acid sequences. The two markers had 97% homology with a resistance gene-like sequence from Aegilops ventricosa and had significant homology with many known plant resistance genes, resistance gene analogs and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from wheat and other plant species. The markers Xwgp-17 and Xwgp-18 also had significant homology with the NB-ARC domain that is in several genes for plant resistance to diseases, nematode cell death and human apoptotic signaling. These markers should be useful to clone Yr5 and combine Yr5 with other genes for durable and superior resistance for the control of stripe rust.

AB Hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and tetraploid emmer wheat (T. dicoccum) hold immense agricultural and economical importance as their end products have varied utilities depending upon the visco-elasticity and other properties of the flour. In the present study, highly regenerable basal segment calli have been employed as the target tissue for genetic transformation of Indian varieties of bread wheat (CPAN1676, PBW343) and emmer wheat (DDK1001). The bar gene conferring herbicide resistance was introduced in one-month-old calli employing both particle bombardment and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation strategies. Transgenic calli were selected on phosphinothricin-containing regeneration medium and putative transformants were raised to maturity. Though the plants exhibited reduced vigour in terms of height and tillering, nonetheless, seed set was normal. The presence of the transgene (bar) was confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. In general, the transformation efficiency was found better with Agrobacterium, even though the construct carried CaMV35S driven bar gene, whereas in the case of biolistics Ubi1 (a monocot promoter)-driven bar gene was employed. Transformation efficiency in the range of 4% was obtained with particle bombardment, whereas it was 7.5% using Agrobacterium-mediated co-cultivation. The different varieties of bread and emmer wheat investigated did not show any marked difference in their transformation ability and could be attributed to a well-established regeneration system in these varieties.

AB The final yield of a crop is the product of growth during the growing season and a number of developmental processes occurring throughout the life cycle of a crop, with most genes influencing the final outcome to a degree. However, recent advances in molecular biology have developed the potential to identify and map many genes or QTLs related to various important traits, including yield, plant adaptation and tolerance to stresses. Significant GxE interactions for yield have been identified, as have interactions associated with QTLs for yield. However, there is little evidence available to confirm that a QTL for yield from a parental line in one mapping population may improve yield when transferred into an adapted, high-yielding line of another population. In order to narrow the apparent gap between the genotype and the phenotype with regard to yield, it is important to identify key traits related to yield and then attempt to identify and locate the genes controlling them. The partitioning of the developmental time to anthesis into different phases: from sowing to the onset of stem elongation and from then to anthesis, as a relatively simple physiological attribute putatively related, to yield, is discussed. If the relationship holds in a wider range of conditions and the genetic factors responsible are located then the genetic basis of yield should be identified. There has also been significant progress in crop simulation modelling. Using knowledge of crop physiology and empirical relationships these models can simulate the performance of crops, including the GxE interactions. Such models require information regarding the genetic basis of yield, which are included in the form of genetic coefficients. Essentially models are constructed as decision-making tools for management but may be of use in detecting prospective traits for selection within a breeding programme. Problems associated with this approach are discussed. This review discusses the need to use crop physiology approaches to analyse components of yield in order to reliably identify the genetic basis of yield.

AB In the present study 17 bread wheat genotypes including Chinese Spring were screened to identify 1BL.1RS translocation (T1BL.1RS). Both molecular approaches and karyotype analysis were used. In 8 of the 17 bread wheat genotypes, the translocation 1BL.1RS was identified using GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) involving total rye genomic DNA as a probe, which allowed identification of a rye chromosome arm carrying a relatively small satellite that is characteristic of 1RS. The microsatellite (SSR) markers specific for 1BS successfully amplified only in 9 genotypes including Chinese Spring, and gave no PCR product in the remaining 8 genotypes, thus confirming the loss of 1BS arm in these 8 genotypes. The 1BL specific microsatellite (SSR) markers, on the other hand, amplified successfully in all the 17 genotypes. Further, in an the above 8 genotypes, instead of normal four prominent satellites, only two prominent satellites were observed at somatic metaphase confirming the replacement of 1BS with 1RS, resulting in T1BL.1RS in these genotypes. The 8 genotypes that carried T1BL.1RS included the following: PBW373, PBW343, PBW175, UP2338, UP2425, UP2418, UP2382 and CPAN3004. These varieties may be considered as a useful germplasm resource for wheat breeding.

AB 23 AFLP bands were assigned to different rye chromosomes by means of two different sets of wheat-rye addition lines. Only one AFLP band could be assigned to 4R, and no specific AFLPs were found on the 5R chromosome. Only one AFLP band was explicitly assigned to 4R, and no specific AFLPs were found on the 5R chromosome. At least seven co-migrating AFLPs showed the same chromosomal location in both sets of addition lines. A total of 22 AFLPs were assigned to chromosome 1R using wheat-rye substitution lines. Six of them have counterparts in one of the addition lines analyzed, but only four have the same chromosomal location. Six and four of the total AFLPs located using addition (23) and substitution (22) lines segregated in the mapping population DS2 x RXL10, but only six were simultaneously assigned to the same chromosome by both approaches. Although co-migrating AFLPs could be located on different rye chromosomes using addition and substitution lines, we believe that AFLPs can be useful as rye chromosome markers.

AB An efficient and reproducible Agrohacterium tumefaciens-mediated system for wheat transformation was developed and genetically transformed wheat plants were produced using precultured immature embryos as the explant. The embryos were inoculated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying a binary vector pPTN115 coding for the beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS), and a selectable marker, the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (NPT II). A. tumefaciens cell density (OD660 = 0.6) for inoculation was found to be crucial. Two hours of inoculation period and co-cultivation for 48 h was favorable for the regeneration of transgenic plants. The transformation efficiency was comparable to that obtained by microprojectile bombardment method used routinely for wheat transformation. Stable integration, expression and inheritance of transgenes were demonstrated by molecular and genetic analysis of transformants. Both marker genes, gus and nptII, were expressed and co-segregated in the T-1 progeny plants. In the majority of cases, the genes showed Mendelian segregation predicted for transgene insertion at a single locus.

Cultured immature embryos of these genotypes were inoculated and co-cultivated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying a binary vector pPTN115 coding for the P-glucuronidase gene (GUS), and a selectable marker, the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (NPT II). Explant genotype influenced transformation success. We found Bob White and Fielder were susceptible to A. tumefaciens infection whereas NE92458 appeared to be resistant. The transformation efficiencies of two spring wheat genotypes, Bob White and Fielder, were 1.0 (2/200) and 0.8 % (2/250), respectively. Stable integration, expression and inheritance of transgenes were demonstrated by molecular and genetic analysis of transformants. Both marker genes, gus and nptII, were expressed and co-segregated in the T, progeny plants. Three out of four cases, the genes showed Mendelian segregation predicted for transgene insertion at a single locus.

AB Emmer is the tetraploid wheat (genome constitution: AABB) from which hexaploid or common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome:AABBDD) was derived. We examined transferability of 180 microsatellite markers from hexaploid wheat to wild emmer wheat [T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (Korn. Ex Asch. & Graebner) Thell.] and cultivated emmer wheat [T turgidum ssp. dicoccum (Schrank ex Shobler) Thell.]. Among the 180 primer pairs, 121 (67.2%) amplified microsatellite loci from the ssp. dicoccoides genome and 122 (67.8%) from the ssp. dicoccum genome. Between these two subspecies, polymorphic banding patterns were observed at 97 (53.5%) microsatellite loci. Five primer pairs.(2.8%) produced amplification products only from the ssp. dicoccoides genome while 7 other primer pairs (3.9%) produced products only from the ssp. dicoccum genome. Fifty microsatellite markers (27.8%) failed to amplify any products in these two subspecies of T. turgidum. The microsatellite markers we identified to show cross-species transferability should be useful in studies of gene mapping and genome evolution in tetraploid wheat.

ID GROUP-3
AB Stem rust resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) conferred by the Sr2 gene has remained effective against Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. U sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn. worldwide for more than 50 yr. Sr2 resistance is associated with variable levels of disease symptoms; it shows recessive inheritance and is expressed primarily during the adult-plant stage. A genetic and physical interval for the Sr2 gene was determined on the short arm of chromosome 3B of wheat. Flanking microsatellite markers were identified and one tightly linked marker (gwm533) was shown to be associated with presence of Sr2. This marker was validated in a wide range of germplasm and can now be implemented in marker-assisted breeding to facilitate selection for this durable, broad-spectrum but difficult to score rust resistance gene.

AB Crown rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata Cda. E sp. avenae Eriksson, is the most damaging disease of oat (Avena sativa L.). Breeding for resistance to crown rust has been an efficient and economical means to control the disease. Most of the resistance genes in recently released oat cultivars have been introgressed from the hexaploid, wild oat species A. sterilis L. The number of effective resistance genes has been rapidly decreasing. Characterization and utilization of new resistance sources are needed to ensure adequate resistance in future oat cultivars. Crown rust resistance in diploid, wild oat accessions was transferred to the hexaploid, cultivated oat line MAM17-5. The objective of this study was to identify the number, position, and effect of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and digenic QTL epistasis controlling crown rust resistance in MAM17-5. A linkage map of 272 molcular markers was used for this analysis. Reaction type and rust severity data were collected on field-grown adult plants from 152 F-5:6 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross, 'Ogle'/ MAM17-5. Composite interval mapping was conducted to identify genomic regions associated with crown rust resistance. Overall, two QTL, Pcq1 on linkage group 28 and Pcq2 on 29, were consistently identified for crown rust resistance in different years. Pcq1 and Pcq2 explained 48.5 to 70.1% and 9.6 to 14.0%, respectively, of the total phenotypic variation for crown rust resistance. Significant digenic, epistatic interactions were detected for QTL controlling rust severity but not reaction type. Marker-assisted selection targeting the major QTL, Pcq1, should be useful for efficient selection of crown rust resistance.

AB In Australian commercial cultivars, each high molecular weight glutenin (Glu-1) homoeologous locus consists of one of two predominant alleles: Glu-A1a (subunit Ax1) or Glu-A1b (subunit Ax2*) at the GluA1 locus, Glu-B1b (Bx7 and By8 subunits) or Glu-B1i (Bx17 and By18 subunits) at the Glu-B1 locus, and Glu-D1d (Dx5 and Dy10 subunits) or Glu-D1a (Dx2 and Dy12 subunits) at the Glu-D1 locus. PCR-based assays have been developed in this study to discriminate between these common alleles at each locus. Primers specific for the Glu-A1 Ax2* gene give a single fragment of 1319 bp only in the presence of this gene. Primers targeting the Glu-B1 locus resulted in a co-dominant marker for which the Bx7 genotype produced two fragments (630 bp and 766 bp) and the Bx17 genotype a single fragment (669 bp). The third pair of primers was specific for the Dx5 gene and resulted in a single band of 478 bp. A multiplexed PCR assay was established which permitted the discrimination of the major HMW glutenins in a single PCR reaction and agarose gel assay. As the HMW glutenin composition of a wheat line is extremely important in determining the functional properties of wheat gluten, these markers are useful for the purposes of marker-assisted breeding. These markers may also be useful for the purpose of DNA-based identification of wheat varieties.

AB The F-2 progeny of a third backcross (BC3) line, BC line 240, derived from a Turkish accession of wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum), segregated for resistance to scald (Rhynchosporium secalis) in a manner indicating the presence of a single dominant resistance gene. Two SCAR markers linked to this resistance were developed from AFLP markers. Screens of disomic and ditelosomic wheat-barley addition lines with the SCAR markers demonstrated that the scald resistance gene is located in the centromeric region of barley chromosome 3H, a region previously reported to contain a major scald resistance locus, Rrs1. Markers that flank the Rrs1 locus were used to screen the wild barley-derived BC3F2 population. These markers also flank the wild barley-derived scald resistance, indicating that it maps to the same locus as Rrs1; it may be allelic, or a separate gene within a complex locus. However, BC line 240 does not respond to treatment with the Rhynchosporium secalis avirulence factor NIP1 in the same way as the Rrs1-carrying cultivar Atlas46. This suggests that the scald resistance gene derived from wild barley confers a different specificity of response to the Rrs1 allele in Atlas46. In order to increase the durability of scald resistance in the field, we suggest that at least two scald resistances should be combined into barley cultivars before release. The scald resistance gene described here will be of value in the Australian environment, and the several markers linked to it will facilitate pyramiding.

AB Synthetic hexaploid wheats are of interest to wheat breeding programs, especially for introducing new genes that confer resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. A group of 54 synthetic hexaploid wheats derived from crosses between emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum, source of the A and B genomes) and goat grass (Aegilops tauschii, D genome donor) were investigated for genetic diversity. Using the AFLP technique, dendrograms revealed clear grouping according to geographical origin for the T. dicoccum parents but no clear groups for the Ae. tauschii parents. The geographical clustering of the T. dicoccum parents was also reflected in the dendrogram of their derived synthetic hexaploids. Diversity of the T. dicoccum parents and their derived synthetic hexaploids was further evaluated by measuring 18 morphological and agronomic traits on the plants. Clustering based on morphological and agronomic data also reflected geographical origin. However, comparison of genetic distances obtained from AFLP and agronomic data showed no correlation between the two diversity measurements. Nevertheless, similarities among major clusters with the two systems could be identified. Based on percentage of polymorphic markers, the synthetic hexaploids had a considerably higher level of AFLP diversity (39%) than normally observed in cultivated hexaploid wheat (12-21%). This suggests that synthetic hexaploid wheats can be used to introduce new genetic diversity into the bread wheat gene pool.

AB Wheat cultivars carrying the 1BL.1RS translocation were crossed with newly synthesised octoploid triticale lines involving four rye genotypes having omega-secalin banding patterns different from each other and from that of the 1BL.1RS translocation. Homologous recombination was expected between the short arm of the 1R chromosomes of the rye genotypes and the 1RS arm of the 1BL.1RS wheat/rye translocation. Seven sequence-specific PCR-based markers: Xiag95, RMS13, Bmac0213, GPI, Xpsr960, 5S and SCM9, and omega-secalin proteins were used to detect recombination events in the BC1F2 generation. Segregation analysis demonstrated that a barley SSR marker (Bmac0213) locus was present on the 1RS chromosome arm. Of 834 plants tested in four different BC1F2 populations, 246 individuals were found to carry recombined 1BL.1RS translocation chromosomes. Genetic linkage analysis was performed on the eight markers in the four different mapping populations. The physical positions of the markers are discussed.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum in North America, often results in significant losses in yield and grain quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Evaluation of FHB resistance is laborious and can be affected by environmental conditions. The development of DNA markers associated with FHB quantitative trait loci (QTL) and their use in breeding programs could greatly enhance selection. The objective of this study was to identify the location and effect of QTLs for FHB resistance using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A population of wheat recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross 'Huapei 57-2'/'Patterson' was characterized for type II resistance in one field experiment and two tests under controlled conditions in the greenhouse. Bulked segregant analysis followed by QTL mapping was used to identify the major segregating QTLs. Results indicate that 'Huapei 57-2' may have the same resistance allele as 'Sumai 3' at a QTL located on the short arm of chromosome 3B. Other QTLs of lower effect size were identified on the long arm of 3B and on chromosomes 3A and 5B. Our findings along with results from other studies demonstrate that the effect of the QTL on 3BS is large and consistent across a wide range of genetic backgrounds and environments. Pyramiding this QTL with other FHB QTLs using marker-assisted selection should be effective in improving FHB resistance in a wheat breeding program.

AB Transgene integration, inheritance and expression were studied in six transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines produced by co-bombardment with two plasmids containing marker genes and genes encoding HMW subunits of wheat glutenin, respectively. Transgene insertion number ranged from 1 to approximately 15. Within a transgenic locus the majority of plasmid copies were found at dispersed genomic sites separated by intervening DNA. However, evidence was obtained for the arrangement of introduced plasmid copies as concatamers and for plasmid truncation and rearrangement. Transgenes were frequently located in genetically unlinked chromosome sites, resulting in independent segregation of loci among progeny. In two lines this gave rise to progeny containing only the gene of interest. Transgenes were inherited in the T-1 generation as a dominant trait although Mendelian segregation ratios were not always observed. No evidence of co-suppression of endogenous HMW subunits was observed.

AB Medicago truncatula Gaertn. is an annual self-pollinating species characterized by a diploid complement 2n = 16 and low DNA content. It responds very well to transformation methods so it is used as a model species for Leguminosae. In contrast with the advanced studies in molecular biology, cytogenetic research has remained limited even though it is an extremely valuable approach to the analysis of the genome structure. In the present study we examined the chromosomal distribution of rDNA sequences in five natural populations of M. truncatula, explored the genomic diversity of this species and found markers for chromosome identification. FISH experiments revealed three distribution patterns of rDNA sequences, distinguished by one, two and three loci of 5S genes; 18S-5 8S-25S genes were always localized at a single locus. The results add information to the genome structure of M. truncatula, revealing a pattern of distribution of rDNA genes unobserved previously, which consists of 5S genes clustered at a single locus. The physical mapping of rDNA sequences is a first contribution towards the construction of a detailed molecular karyotype of M. truncatula.

AB Hordeum chilense is a potential source of useful genes for wheat breeding. The use of this wild species to increase genetic variation in wheat will be greatly facilitated by marker-assisted introgression. In recent years, the search for the most suitable DNA marker system for tagging H. chilense genomic regions in a wheat background has lead to the development of RAPD and SCAR markers for this species. RAPDs represent an easy way of quickly generating suitable introgression markers, but their use is limited in heterogeneous wheat genetic backgrounds. SCARs are more specific assays, suitable for automatation or multiplexing. Direct sequencing of RAPD products is a cost-effective approach that reduces labour and costs for SCAR development. The use of SSR and STS primers originally developed for wheat and barley are additional sources of genetic markers. Practical applications of the different marker approaches for obtaining derived introgression products are described.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze the genetic segregation of heading traits in wheat using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of hexaploid wheat, derived from Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring and T. spelta var. duhameliamum. The population was examined under controlled environmental conditions as well as in the field. This strategy differentiated the effect of three genetic factors (vernalization requirement, photoperiod sensitivity and narrow-sense earliness) and identified their interactions. Correlation analysis showed that photoperiod sensitivity and narrow-sense earliness are critical for heading time in the field. Single-marker analysis using 322 molecular markers segregating among RIL detected a total of 38 linked markers for each genetic factor and heading in the field. In interval analysis, two Vrn genes (Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1) and Ppd-B1 were mapped on chromosomes 5B, 5D and 2B, respectively. It was noticed that Vrn-B1 on 5B from the spelt wheat conferred a strong-spring habit equivalent to the homoeologous Vrn-A1. Quantitative trait locus analysis also showed that Ppd-B1 was not detected under the short-day condition without vernalization treatment, and that there were two types of genes for photoperiod sensitivity, dependent on and independent of vernalization treatment.

AB Two commercial wheat cultivars with low embryogenesis efficiencies, AC Karma and Hy417, were transformed by the bombardment of isolated scutella with two gene constructs. Three AC Karma plants (433, 436, and 437) carrying plasmid pRC62 containing a gus:npt fusion gene, and one Hy417 plant (438) carrying plasmid pBARGUS containing a bar gene and a gusA gene were recovered and characterized. Presence of transgenes in T0 and T1 plants was confirmed by both PCR and Southern hybridization. Copy number of transgenes varied from one to six in these four plants. The inheritance of transgenes in the progeny was characterized. The gusA gene and its activity in AC Karma plant 436 and bar gene and its activity in Hy417 plant 438 segregated in the selfed T1 progeny in a Mendelian 3:1 ratio, but gusA gene and its activity in AC Karma plants 433 and 437 segregated in selfed T1 progeny in a non-Mendelian 1: 1 ratio. The gusA activity in all three AC Karma plants was stably transmitted to selfed T2 or T3 progenies. The levels of gusA and nptII activities in nine T1 plants from AC Karma plant 437 were also determined. A GusA fluorometric assay indicated that gusA activity in the nine T1 plants increased by 2.5-7.2-fold compared with the nontransformed control, while an NptII ELISA assay detected nptII activity only in two of the nine T1 plants, suggesting the nptII gene was silenced in the other seven T1 plants.

AB Three Triticum aestivum L. x Thinopyrum junceum (L.) A. Love partial amphidiploids (2n = 8x = 56; 21" ABD + 7" E-b/E-e) and 11 derived disomic addition lines (2n = 44) were screened for salt tolerance in hydroponic solutions. One addition line (AJDAj5, 21" ABD + 1" E-b) had salt tolerance comparable to that in partial amphidiploids. It was crossed to a wheat line having the Ph-I allele from Aegilops speltoides Tausch to induce homoeologous pairing. F-2 plants were subjected to salt screening and advanced to 30 F-3 families, which were screened again. Four F-3 lines were more tolerant than AJDAj5 when screened in a final electrical conductivity of 42 dS/m. Because one of the four lines was sterile, only three lines were further verified for their salinity tolerance and were cytologically and molecularly analyzed. These lines were translocation lines with 42 chromosomes having tiny fluorescent hybridization signals detected at interstitial positions of less condensed chromosomes using the genomic in situ hybridization technique. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses revealed the presence of very few (ca. 4%) putative markers specific to the E-b-chromosome addition line. These lines also had from 2% to 14% of markers specific to the Ph inhibitor line and a few new AFLP markers that were not found in the two parental lines and the common wheat background, cv. Chinese Spring. Two recombinant lines were more salt tolerant than either parent, while the third one was as tolerant as either parent, which was more tolerant than Chinese Spring. The former two lines are valuable germplasm for breeding salt-tolerant wheat cultivars.

DE leaf rust; resistance genes; STS markers; wheat
AB Thirty-seven wheat cultivars originating from seven European countries were examined by using sequence tagged site (STS) markers for seven Lr (leaf rust = brown rust) resistance genes against the fungal pathogen of wheat Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici (Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr26 and Lr37). Additionally, 22 accessions with various Lr genes from two germplasm collections were tested. A SCAR (sequence-characterized amplified region) marker for Lr24 and a CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) marker for Lr47 were also used to identify those genes in the wheat accessions. Each marker amplified one specific DNA fragment. Three Lr gene markers were identified in wheat cultivars (Lr10, Lr26 and Lr37). Another four markers (Lr9, Lr19, Lr24 and Lr47) were found in breeding lines carrying leaf rust resistance genes. The results were compared with leaf rust resistance gene postulations made in previous studies, based on multipathotype testing. Markers for Lr10, Lr26 and Lr37 may be useful in marker-assisted breeding.

DE leaf rust; Lr genes; molecular markers; Thatcher lines; wheat
AB Sequence tagged site (STS) markers for eight resistance genes against Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici were used to screen a set of near-isogenic lines of wheat cv. Thatcher containing in total 40 different Lr genes and their alleles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was carried out by using STS, SCAR and CAPS primers specific for the leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr28, Lr37 and Lr47. The STS, CAPS and SCAR markers linked to resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr37 and Lr47 were found to be reliable in diverse genetic backgrounds. The amplification product of the Lr1 gene marker was detected in the susceptible cv. Thatcher and in all of the near-isogenic lines examined except Lr2a, Lr2b, Lr2c and Lr19. The sequence analysis of PCR products amplified in lines Lr1, Lr10, Lr28 and in cv. Thatcher indicated that the near-isogenic lines and cv. Thatcher contained in the targeted chromosome region an allele that differed from the original alleles corresponding to Lr1/6* Thatcher (TLR621) and susceptible Thatcher (TH621). The amplification product specific to the STS marker of the Lr1 gene was amplified in almost all Thatcher near-isogenic lines and in cv. Thatcher because their alleles possessed primer sequences identical to the original allele TLR621. The marker for the Lr28 resistance gene was identified in line Lr28, carrying gene Lr28, and in 21 other near-isogenic lines. The sequencing of PCR products specific to Lr28 and generated in lines Lr1, Lr10 and Lr28 indicated that the lines Lr1, Lr10 and Lr28 are heterozygous in this region.

AB Spring wheat nursery accessions, including 18 spring wheat lines derived in CIMMYT, Mexico, and 12 spring wheat cultivars bred in Poland, along with cultivars Frontana and Sumai 3 as resistant controls, were examined for resistance to leaf rust under field conditions. Multipathotype tests with 16 different pathogen isolates were performed for postulation of Lr genes in Polish cultivars. Besides, STS markers for resistance genes Lr1, Lr9, Lr10, Lr24, Lr28, Lr37 were analysed in the studied cultivars and lines with Thatcher near-isogenic lines as positive controls. All Polish cultivars appeared to be susceptible to leaf rust. Ten of the CIMMYT nursery lines (IPG-SW: #7, 11, 14, 21, 22, 23, 27, 29, 30, 32) and cv. Frontana were resistant in the same environment and can be sources of resistance genes. Marker for the Lr10 gene was identified in 6 accessions (IPG-SW #14, 22, 23, 29, 30, 32) exhibiting resistance to leaf rust, whereas markers for Lr1 and Lr28 genes were observed in all the examined accessions. STS markers for Lr9, Lr24 and Lr37 genes were not identified in the investigated accessions.

   multiplex PCR; common wheat
AB Wheat bread-making quality is closely correlated with composition and quantity of gluten proteins, in particular with high-molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits encoded by the Glu-1 genes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed to identify the allele composition of HMW glutenin complex Glu-1 loci (Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1) in common wheat genotypes. The study of multiplex PCR to obtain a well-balanced set of amplicons involved examination of various combinations of selected primer sets and/or thermal cycling conditions. One to three simultaneously amplified DNA fragments of HMW glutenin Glu-1 genes were separated by agarose slab-gel electrophoresis and differences between Ax1, Ax2* and Axnull genes of Glu-A1 loci, Bx6, Bx7 and Bx17 of Glu-B1, and Dx2, Dx5 and Dy10 genes of Glu-D1 loci were revealed. A complete agreement was found in identification of HMW glutenin subunits by both multiplex PCR analysis and SDS-PAGE for seventy-six Polish cultivars/strains of both spring and winter common wheat. Rapid identification of molecular markers of Glu-1 alleles by multiplex PCR can be an efficient alternative to the standard separation procedure for early selection of useful wheat genotypes with good bread-making quality.

AB GrainGenes, http://www.graingenes.org, is the international database for the wheat, barley, rye and oat genomes. For these species it is the primary repository for information about genetic maps, mapping probes and primers, genes, alleles and QTLs. Documentation includes such data as primer sequences, polymorphism descriptions, genotype and trait scoring data, experimental protocols used, and photographs of marker polymorphisms, disease symptoms and mutant phenotypes. These data, curated with the help of many members of the research community, are integrated with sequence and bibliographic records selected from external databases and results of BLAST searches of the ESTs. Records are linked to corresponding records in other important databases, e.g. Gramene's EST homologies to rice BAC/PACs, TIGR's Gene Indices and GenBank. In addition to this information within the GrainGenes database itself, the GrainGenes homepage at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov provides many other community resources including publications (the annual newsletters for wheat, barley and oat, monographs and articles), individual datasets (mapping and QTL studies, polymorphism surveys, variety performance evaluations), specialized databases (Triticeae repeat sequences, EST unigene sets) and pages to facilitate coordination of cooperative research efforts in specific areas such as SNP development, EST-SSRs and taxonomy. The goal is to serve as a central point for obtaining and contributing information about the genetics and biology of these cereal crops.

AB T-DNA recombination and replication was analyzed in 'black mexican sweet' (BMS) cells transformed with T-DNAs containing the replication system from wheat dwarf virus (WDV). Upon recombination between the T-DNA ends, a promoterless marker gene (gusA) was activated. Activation of the recombination marker gene was delayed and increased exponentially over time, suggesting that recombination and amplification of the T-DNA occurred in maize cells. Mutant versions of the viral initiator gene (rep ), known to be defective in the replication function, failed to generate recoverable recombinant T-DNA molecules. Circularization of T-DNA by the FLP/FRT site-specific recombination system and/or homologous recombination was not necessary to recover circular T-DNAs. However, replicating T-DNAs appeared to be suitable substrates for site-specific and homologous recombination. Among 33 T-DNA border junctions sequenced, only one pair of identical junction sites was found implying that the population of circular T-DNAs was highly heterogenous. Since no circular T-DNA molecules were detected in treatments without rep , it suggested that T-DNA recombination was linked to replication and might have been stimulated by this process. The border junctions observed in recombinant T-DNA molecules were indicative of illegitimate recombination and were similar to left-border recombination of T-DNA into the genome after Agro-mediated plant transformation. However, recombination between T-DNA molecules differed from T-DNA/genomic DNA junction sites in that few intact right borders were observed. The replicating T-DNA molecules did not enhance genomic random integration of T-DNA in the experimental configuration used for this study.

AB Microspores at late uninucleate/early binucleate stages were isolated from flower buds of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and in vitro culture methods optimised for their maturation to fully functional viable pollen which, after application to the stigma of emasculated plants in situ, led to the generation of large numbers of seed. Efficient protocols were established for the biolistic introduction of a construct containing a reporter gene and selectable marker into these microspores and hence, after in vitro maturation and in situ fertilisation, for the generation of transgenic plants. Stable transformants of low copy number were generated by this procedure. The efficiency of transformation achieved allows the production of large numbers of transgenic plants without selection, dispensing with the requirement for a selectable marker in plant transgenesis.

AB A set of 130 wheat recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between parents susceptible (WL711) and resistant (HD29) to Karnal bunt (caused by Tilletia indica), were screened for 3 years with the pathogen populations prevalent in northern India. When 90 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 81 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci were mapped on the RILs, markers on chromosomes 2A, 4B and 7B accounted collectively for about one-third of the variation in the disease reaction. The genomic region of largest effect, identified on the long arm of chromosome 4B, reduced Karnal bunt disease by half in three different experiments and accounted for up to 25% of the phenotypic variation for KB reaction. A closely linked SSR marker, GWM538, may be useful in marker-assisted selection for Karnal bunt resistance in wheat.

AB The powdery mildew resistance has been transferred from an Israeli wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides) accession 'G-305-M' into common wheat by crossing and backcrossing (G-305-M/781//Jing 411*3). Genetic analysis showed that the resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene at the seedling stage. Among the 102 pairs of SSR primers tested, four polymorphic microsatellite markers (Xpsp3029, Xpsp3071, Xpsp3152 and Xgwm570) from the long arm of chromosome 6A were mapped in a BC(2)F(3) population segregating for powdery mildew resistance and consisting of 167 plants. The genetic distances between the resistance gene and these four markers were: 0.6 cM to Xpsp3029, 3.1 cM to Xpsp3071, 11.2 cM to Xpsp3152 and 20.4 cM to Xgwm570, respectively. The order of these microsatellite loci agreed well with the established microsatellite map of chromosome arm 6AL. We concluded that the resistance gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 6AL. Based on the origin and chromosomal location of the gene, it is suggested that the resistance gene derived from 'G-305-M' is a novel powdery mildew resistance gene and is temporarily designated MlG.

AB This study investigated genetic polymorphism on a local scale in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici populations during natural epidemics, in four fields located in northern France and sampled in 1998 or 1999. Two hundred and forty-seven isolates were analyzed for their amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) pattern through four primer combinations, and 194 of them were also tested for their virulence factors. Only one or two pathotypes were found in each field, and all isolates had virulence v17, matching the recently introduced Yr17 resistance gene. Polymorphism on a field scale was low. Although 67 loci were polymorphic, 77% of the isolates had the same AFLP pattern, all other patterns being rare or unique. Analyses of the genetic distance between AFLP patterns based on the Jaccard index allowed us to define 12 groups, but a bootstrap analysis showed that all isolates could be assigned to a single clonal lineage. This leads us to conclude that P. striiformis f. sp. tritici populations are clonal on a field scale in northern France.

AB With the aim of broadening the gene pool of Triticeae for crop improvement, the genetic diversity of three hexaploid Elymus species indigenous to Japan and East Asia (E. tsukushiensis, E. humidus and E. dahuricus) was evaluated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 34 accessions: five of E. tsukushiensis, 13 of E. humidus, 15 of E. dahuricus, and one tetraploid Elymus species as an outgroup, were analyzed. The AFLP analysis was conducted with 12 selective primer combinations. In all, 329 bands were scored. The average number of bands scored per accession was 135.3. Among the 34 accessions, no polymorphism was detected among 10 accessions of E. humidus and among three accessions of E. tsukushiensis. Each species showed a diagnostic band pattern. One accession of E. humidus showed a band pattern intermediate between those of E. humidus and E. tsukushiensis, suggesting the occurrence of interspecific introgression. The level of intraspecific variation was highest in E. dahuricus (1-psb = 0.17, pi = 0.010), followed by E. tsukushiensis (1-psb = 0.14, pi = 0.008) and E. humidus (1-psb = 0.03, pi = 0.002). The level of interspecific variation was higher than that of intraspecific variation in all the pairs compared. The level of divergence between E. humidus and E. tsukushiensis was relatively low, but even so it was two times higher than that of the intraspecific variation for each species. The phylogenetic tree constructed here showed clear separations of all the species. The results of this study indicate a clear divergence of E. humidus from E. tsukushiensis in spite of the morphological similarity between these two species. Based on the values of nucleotide diversity, the time of divergence between E. humidus and E. tsukushiensis was estimated to be 0.9-1.2 million years ago.

AB Mutations in the three homeologous waxy loci Wx-A1, Wx-B1, and Wx-D1 of a waxy wheat line have previously been characterized at the molecular level. Using combinations of these mutations, six types of partial waxy wheat plus wild type and waxy wheat (types 1-8) can be produced. Here, we describe primer sets for all three loci that can be used under a single set of conditions, allowing 32 lines to be characterized as types 1-8 in a single PCR run using a 96-well plate. Using multiplex PCR, mutations at the Wx-B1 and Wx-D1 loci can be identified in a single PCR, reducing the number of reactions necessary to identify and select the desired partial waxy wheat line. A single multiplex PCR can be used to detect all three mutations when products are analyzed using capillary electrophoresis on a microchip device. The PCR conditions and primers are effective with a number of cultivars from other countries, indicating that the mutations found at the Wx-A1 and Wx-B1 loci of these cultivars likely have the same origins as the mutations in the corresponding loci of the waxy wheat line used in this study. The PCR selection method described here is an easy and effective alternative to the commonly used SDS-PAGE methods for identification of null alleles.

AB Wheat heads showing symptoms of Fusarium head blight were collected from four commercial fields in Zhejiang Province, China, an area where epidemics occur regularly. A total of 225 isolates were subjected to population-level analyses using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) as markers. Diagnostic RFLP markers established that all isolates belonged to Fusarium graminearum lineage 6. Nine polymorphic probes were hybridized to all isolates, resulting in 65 multilocus RFLP haplotypes (MRH). Probing with the telomeric clone pN1a17, which reveals differences among isolates in the hypervariable subtelomeric region, differentiated the 65 MRH further into 144 clones. Mean gene diversity for the four field populations was similar, ranging from H = 0.306 - 0.364 over the nine RFLP loci for clone-corrected data. High levels of gene flow were inferred from a low level of population subdivision among all field populations, indicating that they were part of the same population. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium measures did not unequivocally support a random mating population, because one-third of locus pairs were significantly different from the null hypothesis of no-association between alleles. We speculate therefore that sexual recombination may not be frequent and that high levels of genotypic diversity may be maintained by relatively low selection pressure acting on a highly diverse population.

AB Yellow rust of wheat caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici has been periodically epidemic and severely damaged wheat production in China and throughout the world. Breeding for resistant cultivars has been proved to be an effective way to resolve the problem. A yellow rust resistance gene, Yr5 , derived from Triticum spelta shows immunity or high resistance to the most popular isolates Tiaozhong 30 and 31 in China. Establishment of DNA markers for the Yr5 gene will facilitate marker-assisted selection and gene pyramiding in the breeding programme. Since the Yr5 gene was cytologically located on the long arm of chromosome 2B, By33, the donor of Yr5 , was crossed and backcrossed with the susceptible line 441, and BC3F2 and BC3F3 segregating populations were screened for polymorphism by using 11 microsatellite primers mapped on chromosome 2B. A marker, Xgwm501-195 bp/160 bp, was found to be linked to Yr5, with a genetic distance of 10.5-13.3 cM.

AB Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) is a comparative genome mapping database for grasses and a community resource for rice (Oryza sativa). It combines a semi-automatically generated database of cereal genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences, genetic maps, map relations, and publications, with a curated database of rice mutants (genes and alleles), molecular markers, and proteins. Gramene curators read and extract detailed information from published sources, summarize that information in a structured format, and establish links to related objects both inside and outside the database, providing seamless connections between independent sources of information. Genetic, physical, and sequence-based maps of rice serve as the fundamental organizing units and provide a common denominator for moving across species and genera within the grass family. Comparative maps of rice, maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and oat (Avena sativa) are anchored by a set of curated correspondences. In addition to sequence-based mappings found in comparative maps and rice genome displays, Gramene makes extensive use of controlled vocabularies to describe specific biological attributes in ways that permit users to query those domains and make comparisons across taxonomic groups. Proteins are annotated for functional significance using gene ontology terms that have been adopted by numerous model species databases. Genetic variants including phenotypes are annotated using plant ontology terms common to all plants and trait ontology terms that are specific to rice. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the search tools available to the plant research community in Gramene.

ID DWARFING GENE RHT8; BREAD WHEAT; MARKERS
AB The dwarfing gene Rht8 and the photoperiodic insensitivity gene Ppd-D1 are linked on the short arm of chromosome 2D of bread wheat and play an important role in determining the geographic adaptation of modern wheat varieties. The genes are believed to originate from the old Japanese variety 'Akakomugi' and have been distributed throughout the world by diverse breeding programmes. Twelve microsatellite loci previously mapped on wheat chromosome 2D were used for a retrospective analysis of 59 wheat varieties with known pedigree, to trace the transmittance of the chromosomal region around these genes during extended breeding programmes. Within the range of the screened varieties 100 alleles were detected at the 12 microsatellite loci. For each microsatellite locus, a screen over varieties was performed to find the alleles corresponding to the parental variety 'Akakomugi'. A comparison of wheat varieties carrying the 192-bp allele, at locus Xgwm261-2D which is diagnostic for the presence of the gene Rht8, with the varieties without Rht8, showed linkage disequilibrium of 'Akakomugi' alleles for a segment of chromosome 2D which comprised at least 28 cM. Selection was accompanied with a linkage drag of 'Akakomugi' alleles in the neighbouring loci to Rht8. A diminution of the segment of chromosome 2D originating from 'Akakomugi' during several pedigree generations was observed. Varieties of the early generations were found to carry the whole short arm of chromosome 2D of 'Akakomugi', while the varieties of further selections possessed smaller segments including the diagnostic allele at locus Xgwm261-2D. Our results demonstrate that microsatellites can be successfully used for studying the inheritance of chromosomes within pedigrees of breeding programmes.

AB Introduced transgenes, uidA, sgfp (S65T) and/ or bar, were localized using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosomes of transgenic barley produced by microparticle bombardment of immature embryos. Of the 19 independent transgenic lines (eight diploid and 11 tetraploid), nine had uidA and ten had sgfp (S65T). All lines tested had three or more copies of the transgenes and 18 out of 19 lines had visibly different integration sites. At a gross level, it appeared that no preferential integration sites of foreign DNA among chromosomes were present in the lines tested; however, a distal preference for transgene integration was observed within the chromosome. In diploid To plants that gave a 3:1 segregation ratio of transgene expression in the T-1, only single integration sites were detected on one of the homologous chromosomes. Homozygous diploid plants had doublet signals on a pair of homologous chromosomes. All tetraploid T-0 plants that gave a 3:1 segregation ratio in the T-1 generation had only a single integration site on one of the homologous chromosomes. In contrast, the single tetraploid T-0 plant with a 35:1 segregation ratio in the T-1 generation had doublet signals on a pair of homologous chromosomes. In the one tetraploid To line, which had a homozygote-like segregation ratio (45:0), there were doublet signals at two loci on separate chromosomes. We conclude that the application of FISH for analysis of transgenic plants is useful for the gross localization of transgene(s) and for early screening of homozygous plants.

AB As a rule, recombination in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is low in proximal and high in distal regions of chromosomes. Recombination may be enhanced in proximal regions by using deletion ( del) chromosomes deficient for a distal part of a chromosome arm. The chromosome del5BL- 11 derived from Chinese Spring ( CS) is missing 41% of the distal long arm. This line was made polymorphic by crossing with a stock in which chromosome 5B of CS ( 5B(CS)) is substituted for chromosome 5B of T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides origin (5B(T.dic)). Three recombinant del5BL- 11 ( del5BL-11(rec)) lines were isolated, all resulting from localized recombination between loci Xbcd926 and XksuH1. In del5BL- 11(rec), the centromere to fraction length ( FL) 0.53 ( C- FL0.53) segment is derived from 5B(T. dic) and the distal region of FL 0.55 - 0.59 is from 5B(CS). Genetic recombination for the C- FL 0.53 interval was assayed in segregating progenies from 5B(CS)/ 5B(T. dic) and del5BL- 11/ del5BL- 11(rec) crosses using polymorphic markers and for the FL 0.55 - 0.59 interval in del5BL- 11/ del5BL- 11rec cross from chiasma counts. The pairing data and comparative mapping of normal 5B and del5BL- 11 indicated that the increase in recombination was restricted to the FL 0.55 - 0.59 interval of the del5BL- 11 chromosome. No significant increase in recombination in more proximal regions was observed although the order of several markers that cosegregated in the normal 5B map was resolved in the del5BL- 11 map. The presented data show that recombination in proximal, usually low- recombination, regions can be increased by placing them close to the chromosome end.

AB The ability of the weedy species jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host) to form seed-bearing hybrids with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) raises questions concerning the potential movement of herbicide-resistance genes from commercial wheat cultivars into the weed population. As a preliminary step for future gene-flow risk assessments, a study of jointed goatgrass X wheat hybrids collected from infested wheat fields in 1998 and 1999 was undertaken in Oregon. Jointed goatgrass accessions representing the range of variation in its worldwide distribution also were included in this study. The high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins, a group of wheat endosperm storage proteins, were used as genetic markers for characterizing this material. In the Oregon jointed goatgrass accessions, the seed protein analysis identified F, hybrid seed that was formed at a rate of 0 to 8% on a per field basis. The HMW glutenin patterns in the backcross seed threshed from Oregon hybrids showed a higher proportion of seeds formed from pollination by wheat than by jointed goalgrass. Analysis of the roots for remains of the maternal seed or spikelet indicated that most hybrid plants were of the F, generation and that either jointed goatgrass or wheat could be the female parent. These analyses suggested a hybridization dynamics in which jointed goatgrass serves as the predominant F, female parent and wheat as the predominant backcross male parent. Development of introgressed jointed goatgrass forms carrying wheat genes would be dependent on the presence of a continuous hybrid zone located near or within a persistent jointed goatgrass population.

AB Ascochyta blight of pea (Pisum sativum L.) is a fungal disease caused by Mycosphaerella pinodes (Berk. & Bloxham) Verstergren, Phoma medicaginis Malbr. & Roum. var. pinodella (L.K. Jones) Boerema, and Ascochyta pisi Lib. that can result in significant reductions to pea yield and quality. To characterize the genetics of resistance and to identify molecular markers for use in plant breeding, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting Ascochyta blight resistance were mapped in F-2:3 and F-2:4 families produced from a cross between resistant breeding line 3148-A88 and susceptible cultivar Rovar. A linkage map containing 96 loci on 11 linkage groups was constructed for 133 families from this cross. Resistance of progeny lines to natural Ascochyta blight epidemics was examined in field trials at Medina, Western Australia, in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Disease severity was assessed on stems, leaves, and pods by means of separate rating scales. Because pea shows increased susceptibility to Ascochyta blight as it matures, plant reproductive stage was assessed at the time of disease scoring in the 1998 and 1999 trials. Thirteen QTLs were detected for Ascochyta blight resistance on seven linkage groups. Eight of these QTLs were detected in multiple environments or by multiple trait scores. One QTL for plant developmental stage was detected. Linkage of Ascochyta blight resistance QTLs to candidate genes including disease response genes and resistance gene analogs and of the QTL for plant reproductive stage to a pea homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTANS gene controlling flowering time in response to photoperiod is discussed.

AB Population genetic structure of the fungal wheat pathogen Tapesia yallundae in Washington State was determined using genetically characterized amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers and mating-type (MAT1-1 or MAT1-2). Segregation and linkage relationships among 164 AFLP markers and MAT were analysed using 59 progeny derived from an in vitro cross. Alleles at 158 AFLP loci and the mating-type locus segregated in a 1:1 ratio. Ten unlinked markers were chosen to determine genetic and genotypic diversity and to test the hypothesis of random mating and population differentiation among five subpopulations of T. yallundae representative of the geographical distribution of wheat production in eastern Washington. Among 228 isolates collected, overall gene diversity was high (h = 0.425) and a total of 91 unique multilocus genotypes (MLG) were identified, with 32 MLG occurring at least twice. The overall population genetic structure was consistent with random mating based on the segregation of mating-type, index of association (I-A), parsimony tree length permutation test (PTLPT) and genotypic diversity analyses. However, clonal genotypes were found within each subpopulation and were also distributed among the five subpopulations. No significant differences in allele frequencies were found among the five subpopulations for all 10 loci based on contingency table analysis (G(2)) and Wier & Cockerham's population differentiation statistic theta (theta = -0.008, P = 0.722). T. yallundae appears to consist of a large homogeneous population throughout eastern Washington with both sexual and asexual reproduction contributing to the observed population genetic structure despite no report of sexual fruiting bodies of T. yallundae occurring under natural field conditions.

AB Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to deal with toxic levels of metals in the soil. In this paper, an overview of recent progress with regards to understanding fundamental molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying plant resistance to both aluminum (Al) and heavy metals is presented. The discussion of plant Al resistance will focus on recent advances in our understanding of a mechanism based on Al exclusion from the root apex, which is facilitated by Al-activated exudation of organic acid anions. The consideration of heavy metal resistance will focus on research into a metal hyperaccumulating plant species, the Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator, Thlaspi caerulescens, as an example for plant heavy metal research. Based on the specific cases considered in this paper, it appears that quite different strategies are used for Al and heavy metal resistance. For Al, our current understanding of a resistance mechanism based on excluding soil-borne Al from the root apex is presented. For heavymetals, a totally different strategy based on extreme tolerance and metal hyperaccumulation is described for a hyperaccumulator plant species that has evolved on naturally metalliferous soils. The reason these two strategies are the focus of this paper is that, currently, they are the best understood mechanisms of metal resistance in terrestrial plants. However, it is likely that other mechanisms of Al and/or heavy metal resistance are also operating in certain plant species, and there may be common features shared for dealing with Al and heavy resistance. Future research may uncover a number of novel metal resistance mechanisms in plants. Certainly the complex genetics of Al resistance in some crop plant species, such as rice and maize, suggests that a number of presently unidentified mechanisms are part of an overall strategy of metal resistance in crop plants.

AB Transgenic lines of the spring barley variety Golden Promise containing the firefly luciferase gene were produced by particle bombardment of immature embryos. Non-destructive analysis of luciferase gene expression was used to monitor the transformation process. This revealed that transformation efficiency, in terms of the percentage of bombarded immature embryos giving rise to transformed callus lines, was very high, up to 40%. Following the expression of the luciferase gene provided a method for the sensitive, non-destructive, real-time monitoring of gene expression throughout the transformation process. Luciferase expression could also be used to easily identify transgenic plants and to identify homozygous transgenic plants at an early stage. The production of transgenic barley by selecting for luciferase-positive material, without an additional selection system, was possible but technically difficult.

AB We have produced transgenic maize plants containing a wheat Glu-1Dx5 gene encoding the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit 1Dx5. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that a protein similar in size to the wheat 1Dx5 subunit accumulates in the endosperm of transgenic maize from four independent transformation events. This protein reacts with a monoclonal antibody specific to the wheat 1Dx5 subunit and was not detected in nontransgenic controls or in pollen, anthers, leaves or embryos of plants grown from seeds expressing this protein in endosperm. Genomic Southern-blot analysis is consistent with results from SDS-PAGE and indicates that the transgene integration sites are complex and are different in the four events studied. Using the presence of this protein as a phenotypic marker, we studied the inheritance of this gene through three sexual generations. Reciprocal crosses with nontransgenic plants and self-pollinations were performed, and the resulting kernels were analyzed for the presence of the 1Dx5 subunit. These data, together with PCR analysis for the transgene, suggest that the transgene is inefficiently transmitted through pollen in all four events.

Two wheat isolines inoculated with Puccinia recondita were analysed: Sinvalocho MA line carrying the Lr3 gene for leaf rust resistance on distal chromosome 6BL, and a rust-susceptible derivative of the Sinvalocho MA line with a deletion at the distal end of chromosome 6BL. Comparison of mRNA fingerprinting profiles, obtained from control and rust-inoculated plants, let to the isolation of 34 differentially displayed cDNAs. All these genes, except TaRr16, were up-regulated in the rust-inoculated resistant line. TaRr16 has constitutive expression in the rust-resistant line while no expression was detected in the rust-susceptible line. A number of those cDNAs revealed homology to genes previously identified in other plant-pathogen interactions. Two out of the 34 cDNAs, mapped in the distal part of chromosome 6BL and TaRr16, was genetically linked to the Lr3 gene. DNA sequence differences and differential expression between non-allelic copies of TaRr16, are also reported.

AB Seven transgenic lines of wheat have been evaluated under field conditions during 2 agonomic years. Four lines contained the transgenes for beta-glucuronidase (uidA), herbicide resistance (bar) and for one high-molecular-weight (HMW) subunit, and three lines contained only one transgene for one HMW glutenin subunit and no marker genes. Agronomic traits and yield components were studied in transgenic lines and compared with the non-transgenic parent and null segregant lines. Although phenotypic differences for many traits have been found, only heading date and the number of spikelets per spike showed clear genotypic differences for both field trials. All transgenic lines had a longer heading date than parent lines whereas the number of spikelets per spike in transgenic lines was around that for L88-31 and higher for L88-6 than the corresponding parent lines. No differences were found between lines constitutively expressing the uidA and bar genes from those which only expressed the HMW genes. We conclude that differences between transgenic lines and their parents are small, and could be eliminated by backcrossing transgenic lines with their parents and selecting for the wanted genotype.

ID LOCI
AB PCR-based markers were developed to detect the point mutations responsible for the two major semi-dwarfing genes Rht-B1b (Rht1) and Rht-D1b (Rht2) in wheat. These markers were validated by testing 19 wheat varieties of known Rht genotype. They included Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfs, double-mutant varieties and tall wheats. These were correctly genotyped with the RhtB1b and Rht-D1b- specific primers, as well as markers specific for the tall alleles Rht-B1a and Rht-D1a. Using a family of doubled-haploid lines segregating for Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, the markers were mapped to the expected homoeologous regions of chromosomes 4B and 4D, respectively. Both markers were strongly correlated with a reduction in height, accounting for 23% (Rht-B1b) and 44% (Rht-D1b) of the phenotypic variance in the population. These markers will have utility in marker-assisted selection of the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b genes in wheat breeding programs.

AB Low-temperature soluble carbohydrate accumulations are commonly associated with anthocyanin coloration, attenuated growth and cold adaptation of cool-season grasses. The vrn-1 gene has potent effects on vernalization requirement, growth, and soluble carbohydrate accumulations of the winter-annual Triticeae species. Two hundred and four unmapped AFLP markers and genome-specific DNA markers genetically linked to the vrn-1 gene were used to detect QTL controlling soluble carbohydrate accumulations, anthocyanin coloration and growth characteristics in a segregating population derived from open pollinated Leymus cinereus x L. triticoides hybrids. These perennial Triticeae grasses are distinguished by adaptation and growth habit. As expected, positive trait correlations and pleiotropic gene effects were detected for soluble carbohydrate accumulations and anthocyanin coloration. Likewise, positive trait correlations and pleiotropic gene effects were detected for tillering, leaf development, leaf growth, regrowth and rhizome spread. However, soluble carbohydrate accumulations were not associated with attenuated growth. In fact, several DNA marker alleles, including one near vrn-Ns1, had positive effects on soluble leaf carbohydrate concentrations and low temperature growth. The corresponding DNA marker near vrn-Ns1 had more specific effects on tillering. We speculate that vrn-1 exerts quantitative effects on low-temperature soluble leaf carbohydrate accumulations and growth habit of the perennial Leymus. However, a number of other DNA markers displayed highly significant effects on soluble carbohydrate accumulations and various growth characteristics. Findings indicate that anthocyanin coloration may be a useful phenotypic marker for soluble carbohydrate accumulation. Although variation for soluble carbohydrates was not associated with attenuated growth in this population, this trait was under genetic control.

AB We isolated a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoding gene and its cDNA from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, and designated it nagA. The nagA gene contained no intron and encoded a polypeptide of 603 amino acids with a putative 19-amino acid signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to the sequence of Candida albicans Hex1 and Trichoderma harzianum Nag1. Yeast cells containing the nagA cDNA under the control of the GAL1 promoter expressed beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. The chromosomal nagA gene of A. nidulans was disrupted by replacement with the argB marker gene. The disruptant strains expressed low levels of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity and showed poor growth on a medium containing chitobiose as a carbon source. Aspergillus oryzae strain carrying the nagA gene under the control of the improved glaA promoter produced large amounts of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in a wheat bran solid culture.

Loci coding for seed storage proteins were allocated to chromosomes 1L (HMW GLU1,2 and Glu1), 1S (LMW GLU6,7, LMW GLU1-4. omegaGLI1-4. gammaGLI5 and Gli-1) and 6L (alpha/betaGLI7-14). Parameters related to bread-making quality (SDS sedimentation volume, specific sedimentation volume (SSV) and total protein content) were studied in one of the two populations. A QTL that is consistently present across environments was detected for SIDS sedimentation volume and for SSV. The position of the QTL on chromosome IS was in close agreement with the map positions of storage-protein loci. A second QTL was mapped on chromosome 5. For protein content, two significant QTLs were mapped to linkage groups 1 and 5.

AB AFLP markers in linkage disequilibrium with nuH13, an avirulence gene in the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) that conditions avirulence to resistance gene H13 in wheat (Triticum spp.), were discovered by bulked segregant analysis. Five AFLPs were converted into codominant site-specific markers that genetically mapped within 13 cM of this gene. Flanking markers used as probes positioned nuH13 near the telomere of the short arm of Hessian fly chromosome X2. These results suggest that the X-linked avirulence genes nuH6, nuH9, and nuH13 are present on Hessian fly chromosome X2 rather than on chromosome X1 as reported previously. Genetic complementation demonstrated that recessive alleles of nuH13 were responsible for the H13-virulence observed in populations derived from four different states in the U.S.A.: Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington. Results support the hypothesis that a gene-for-gene interaction exists between wheat and Hessian fly.

AB Functional logic employed by the nervous system for information processing resides mainly in the wiring patterns among specific types of neurons. Therefore, detailed knowledge on neuronal networks is essential for understanding a wide range of brain functions. A powerful and long-awaited method for analyzing the neuronal connectivity patterns would be to deliver tracers selectively to specific types of neurons and at the same time to label transsynaptically their axonal target neurons. For this purpose, we took advantage of a unique property of plant lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which has been used as a transsynaptic tracer in classical neuroanatomical studies. We developed a novel genetic strategy that employs WGA cDNA as a transgene, for the visualization of selective and functional neural pathways in the nervous system. In this article, I will introduce several examples of neural pathways visualized with the WGA transgene and discuss about its further refinement and applications.

AB Marker-assisted selection may be useful for combining specific vernalization response (Vrn) alleles into a single wheat genotype for yield enhancement; however, DNA markers are only available for two of the three genes identified to date. The objectives of this study were to investigate reciprocal effects on days to heading using F-2 populations generated by cross-hybridizing near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying spring (Vrn-B1; TDB) and winter (vrn-B1; TDC) alleles, and to identify markers linked to Vrn-B1 through genetic linkage analysis. Heading data were recorded for 91 and 89 progeny from reciprocal mapping populations TDB/TDC and TDC/TDB, respectively, and significant (P < 0.0001) reciprocal and dominance effects were detected. Among 207 amplified fragment length polymorphisms primer pairs and seven wheat microsatellite markers screened, two and one, respectively, were linked distally to Vrn-B1 on wheat chromosome 5BL. Microsatellite Xgwm408 was most closely linked to Vrn-B1 at 3.9 and 1.1 cM in the TDB/TDC and TDC/TDB map, respectively. Reciprocal differences in recombination distances emphasize the importance of female parent choice when generating mapping populations. Molecular markers are now available for three Vrn loci in wheat.

AB A set of 24 wheat microsatellite markers, representing at least one marker from each chromosome, was used for the assessment of genetic diversity in 998 accessions of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) which originated from 68 countries of five continents. A total of 470 alleles were detected with an average allele number of 18.1 per locus. The highest number of alleles per locus was detected in the B genome with 19.9, compared to 17.4 and 16.5 for genomes A and D, respectively. The lowest allele number per locus among the seven homoeologous groups was observed in group 4. Greater genetic variation exists in the non-centromeric regions than in the centromeric regions of chromosomes. Allele numbers increased with the repeat number of the microsatellites used and their relative distance from the centromere, and was not dependent on the motif of microsatellites. Gene diversity was correlated with the number of alleles. Gene diversity according to Nei for the 26 microsatellite loci varied from 0.43 to 0.94 with an average of 0.77, and was 0.78, 0.81 and 0.73 for three genomes A, B and D, respectively. Alleles for each locus were present in regular two or three base-pair steps, indicating that the genetic variation during the wheat evolution occurred step by step in a continuous manner. In most cases, allele frequencies showed a normal distribution. Comparative analysis of microsatellite diversity among the eight geographical regions revealed that the accessions from the Near East and the Middle East exhibited more genetic diversity than those from the other regions. Greater diversity was found in Southeast Europe than in North and Southwest Europe. The present study also indicates that microsatellite markers permit the fast and high throughput fingerprinting of large numbers of accessions from a germplasm collection in order to assess genetic diversity.

AB Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L em Thell) is derived from a complex hybridization procedure involving three diploid species carrying the A, B and D genomes, respectively. We recently isolated microsatellites from a T tauschii library enriched for various motifs and evaluated the transferability of these markers to several diploid species carrying the A, B or D genomes. All of the primer pairs amplifying more than one locus on bread wheat and half of those giving D-genome-specific loci gave an amplification product on A-and/or B-diploid species. All of the markers giving a single amplification product for T tauschii and no amplification on the other diploid species were D-genome-specific at the hexaploid level. The non-specific microsatellite markers (which gave an amplification product on diploid species carrying the A, B or D genome) gave either a complex amplification pattern on bread wheat (with several bands) or generated a single band which mapped to the D genome. Southern blot hybridizations with probes corresponding to the microsatellite flanking regions gave a signal on all diploid and hexaploid species, whatever the specificity of the microsatellite. The patterns observed on bread wheat were generally in accordance with those observed for diploid species, with slight rearrangements. This suggests that the specificity of microsatellite markers is probably due to mutations in microsatellite flanking regions rather than sequence elimination during polyploidization events and that genome stringency is higher at the polyploid than at the diploid level.

AB Colinearity between wheat and rice genomes is quite well established at the chromosome level, but less is known at a finer level. We tried to specify these relationships for the wheat 5BS chromosome-arm distal region, where a major locus for crossability was located. By developing AFLP markers, we succeeded to locate this major QTL more precisely. One cloned AFLP fragment mapped to rice chromosome 11, which was in agreement with a rice chromosome-11 linkage block reported in this region. However a second marker, a RFLP probe, showed a break in synteny because it mapped to rice long-arm chromosomes 1 and 5, while screening a rice BAC library with the same probe identified rice chromosomes 5 and 6. Therefore, we concluded that the syntenic relationships were more complex at the fine level. The observed results might indicate the presence of a linkage block carrying a crossability gene on wheat groups 1, 5 and 7, and also on rice chromosomes 5 and 6.

AB Hessian fly is one of the world's most destructive insect pests of wheat Triticum aestivum L. We have used the combination of near-isogenic lines (NIL) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis to screen up to 2,000 primers to identify DNA markers that are linked to gene H6 that confers resistance to biotype B of the insect. This screen produced six primers that show polymorphic fragments associated with resistance by H6. We have screened 440 F-2 individuals from a cross of the susceptible cultivar Newton and a NIL that contains H6 to verify the linkage between these markers and the resistance gene. A high-resolution genetic map was constructed based on recombination frequency. Two of the markers were tightly linked to the gene with no recombination observed, three were within 2.0 cM, and one was 11 cM from the gene. Three of the six markers were successfully converted to sequence tagged site (STS) markers. Both RAPD and STS primers were used to screen for the presence or absence of the resistance gene in wheat varieties. The identification of markers and construction of the genetic high resolution map provide the first steps toward localization of this resistance gene.

AB The genome of the Mastreviruses encodes a replication-associated protein (RepA) that interacts with members of the plant retinoblastoma-related protein family, which are putative cell cycle regulators. Expression of ZmRb1, a maize retinoblastoma-related gene, and RepA inhibited and stimulated, respectively, cell division in tobacco cell cultures. The effect of RepA was mitigated by over-expression of ZmRb1. RepA increased transformation frequency and callus growth rate of high type 11 maize germplasm. RepA-containing transgenic maize calli remained embryogenic, were readily regenerable, and produced fertile plants that transmitted transgene expression in a Mendelian fashion. In high type 11, transformation frequency increased with the strength of the promoter driving RepA expression. When a construct in which RepA was expressed behind its native LIR promoter was used, primary transformation frequencies did not improve for two elite Pioneer maize inbreds. However, when LIR:RepA-containing transgenic embryos were used in subsequent rounds of transformation, frequencies were higher in the RepA+ embryos. These data demonstrate that RepA can stimulate cell division and callus growth in culture, and improve maize transformation.

AB Secondary metabolites produced by pathogens during the infection process are thought to play a role as pathogenicity or virulence determinants in many plant diseases. Baker's yeast and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana are attractive models for elucidating molecular mechanisms of resistance to toxic substances. For the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, the following resistance mechanisms were identified in yeast: (1) reduced toxin uptake due to the ABC transporter protein Pdr5p (molecular efflux pump), (2) detoxification by the acetyltransferase Ayt1p, and (3) modification of the ribosomal target by amino acid changes in the ribosomal protein L3 (Rp13p). PDR5-like genes exist in plant genomes as large gene families and could play an important role as a first line of defence against a broad range of toxic metabolites. Amino acid alterations in the highly conserved RPL3 genes could likewise play a role in trichothecene resistance in plants. The knowledge obtained using model systems should be valuable in biotechnological approaches to disease control and marker-assisted resistance breeding.

AB Expression of phytoglobin (Hb) was investigated in germinating barley embryos. Hb mRNA was detectable on northern blots within 2 h of the start of imbibition and expression continued to increase up to radicle elongation. The amounts of mRNA expressed were decreased under an atmosphere of 40% O-2 and increased under 3% O-2 suggesting a link with low-oxygen stress in these embryos. When previously imbibed seeds were stored dry before the onset of radicle protrusion, the seeds remained viable for at least I year and Hb mRNA was detectable in the embryos throughout this time. However, under unfavourable storage conditions, Hb presence in the embryos correlated with poor viability in storage. These findings are discussed in relation to the use of Hb as a germination marker, its use as an indicator of quality loss and its importance in energy maintenance in the seed.

AB Improved gene transfer techniques are necessary to obtain adequate numbers of stable transgenic wheat plants needed for practical purposes. Considering that wheat transformation is genotype-dependent, we used cv. Combi in all experiments, which had been selected from agronomically important German spring wheat cultivars because of its high transformation ability. In most wheat gene transfer attempts, immature embryos or embryogenic scutellar calli were microbombarded. We compared both methods under optimised conditions, using bar, uidA, and gfp as markers in co-transformation attempts. Integration of the genes mentioned above was proven by Southern blotting, expression levels were measured by assays on phosphinothricin acetyltransferase and beta-glucuronidase activities, and by monitoring for green fluorescent protein in most developmental stages. Following bombardment of scutellar calli, an average transformation frequency of 0.13% was attained. Using immature embryos, mean transformation frequency (1.06%) was 8-fold higher. In addition, embryo techniques were over 2 weeks faster than scutellar callus procedures. Introducing gfp as a vital marker led to an improvement of embryo-based techniques. In a first screening, transient gfp-expressing embryos were transferred to phosphinothricin containing callus medium. Only gfp-expressing calli which developed on it were cultured further on phosphinothricin containing regeneration medium. Shoots obtained from gfp-expressing calli were rooted on phosphinothricin-free medium, and cultured ex vitro. Average transformation frequency (4.93%) was 38-fold higher than with scutellar callus techniques. Differences between the transformation strategies used were of high statistical significance. Combining green fluorescent protein screening with phosphinothricin selection in embryo-based techniques offers a promising system to obtain high wheat transformation frequencies.

AB The genetic structure of field populations of Mycosphaerella graminicola was determined across a hierarchy of spatial scales using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers. The hierarchical gene diversity analysis included 1,098 isolates from seven field populations. Spatial scales ranged from millimeters to thousands of kilometers, including comparisons within and among lesions, within and among fields, and within and among regions and continents. At the smallest spatial scale, microtransect sampling was used to determine the spatial distribution of 15 genotypes found among 158 isolates sampled from five individual lesions. Each lesion had two to six different genotypes including both mating types in four of the five lesions, but in most cases a lesion was composed of one or two genotypes that occupied the majority of the lesion, with other rare genotypes interspersed among the common genotypes. The majority (77%) of gene diversity was distributed within plots ranging from approximate to1 to 9 m(2) in size. Genotype diversity (GIN) within fields for the Swiss, Texas, and Israeli fields was high, ranging from 79 to 100% of maximum possible values. Low population differentiation was indicated by the low G(ST) values among populations, suggesting a corresponding high degree of gene flow among these populations. At the largest spatial scale, populations from Switzerland, Israel, Oregon, and Texas were compared. Population differentiation among these populations was low (G(st) = 0.05), and genetic identity between populations was high. A low but significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance among populations was found (r = -0.47, P = 0.012), suggesting that these populations probably have not reached an equilibrium between gene flow and genetic drift. Gene flow on a regional level can be reduced by implementing strategies, such as improved stubble management that minimize the production of ascospores. The possibility of high levels of gene flow on a regional level indicates a significant potential risk for the regional spread of mutant alleles that enable fungicide resistance or the breakdown of resistance genes.

AB Carboxypeptidases expressed in the aleurone layer participate in the mobilization of endosperm storage proteins during cereal grain germination. The genes encoding these proteins are also expressed in the scutellum of germinating grains, but their function in this organ is not yet clear. We have analyzed the expression of a carboxypeptidase III (CPIII) gene in germinating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains. CPIII transcripts accumulated transiently in the scutellum showing a maximum at 2-3 days after imbibition and were exclusively localized to the scutellar vascular tissue. The analysis of CPIII expression in developing shoots and roots from growing seedlings confirmed the localization of CPIII transcripts to differentiating vascular tissue. The TUNEL assay detected in situ nuclear DNA fragmentation in cells showing CPIII expression, indicating that they undergo programmed cell death. Relative RT-PCR analysis showed that the CPIII gene expressed at high level in aleurone cells is the one expressed in vegetative tissues, and allowed the use of this gene as a molecular marker of tracheary element differentiation in wheat seedlings. These results are indicative of the involvement of serine carboxypeptidases in programmed cell death during the development of the vascular tissue in wheat, a new role for these enzymes, besides the mobilization of starchy-endosperm proteins during germination.

AB A limited number of constitutive promoters have been used to direct transgene expression in plants and they are often derived from non-plant sources. Here, we describe novel gene-regulatory elements which are associated with a cryptic constitutive promoter from tobacco, tCUP, and modifications that were made to create a strong gene-expression system that is effective across all living cell types from a wide range of plant species, including several important crops (Arabidopsis, canola, flax, alfalfa, tobacco). The tCUP 5' untranslated region was mutated to eliminate translational interference by upstream ATGs, and the influence of the Kozak consensus sequence on the levels of a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene activity was demonstrated. These modifications resulted in expression that was greatly enhanced in all organs. A TATA consensus sequence was added to the core promoter to complement an existing Initiator (Inr) sequence. Although this addition was known to elevate core promoter activity by 3-fold the additive effect on the overall gene-expression system was marginal in all of the transgenic plants tested. Two transcriptional enhancers were identified and the region containing them were oligomerized, yielding a significant increase in marker gene-expression in some but not all plant species. In general, the enhanced tCUP gene-expression system generated levels of GUS activity which exceeded that of the 35S promoter in most plant species and the elevation in activity occurred uniformly among the various plant organs. The potential benefit of cryptic elements for the construction of gene-expression systems for crop species is discussed.

AB A simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based linkage map has been constructed for perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) using a one-way pseudo-testcross reference population. A total of 309 unique perennial ryegrass SSR (LPSSR) primer pairs showing efficient amplification were evaluated for genetic polymorphism, with 31% detecting segregating alleles. Ninety-three loci have been assigned to positions on seven linkage groups. The majority of the mapped loci are derived from cloned sequences containing (CA)n-type dinucleotide SSR arrays. A small number (7%) of primer pairs amplified fragments that mapped to more than one locus. The SSR locus data has been integrated with selected data for RFLP, AFLP and other loci mapped in the same population to produce a composite map containing 258 loci. The SSR loci cover 54% of the genetic map and show significant clustering around putative centromeric regions. BLASTN and BLASTX analysis of the sequences flanking mapped SSRs indicated that a majority (84%) are derived from non-genic sequences, with a small proportion corresponding to either known repetitive DNA sequence families or predicted genes.

AB An earliness per se gene, designated Eps-A(m)1, was mapped in diploid wheat in F-2 and single-seed descent mapping populations from the cross between cultivated (DV92) and wild (G3116) Triticum monococcum accessions. A QTL with a peak on RFLP loci Xcdo393 and Xwg241, the most distal markers on the long arm of chromosome 1A(m), explained 47% of the variation in heading date (LOD score 8.3). Progeny tests for the two F-2:3 families with critical recombination events between Xcdo393 and Xwg241 showed that the gene was distal to Xcdo393 and linked to Xwg241. Progeny tests and replicated experiments with line #3 suggested that Eps-A(m)1 was distal to Xwg241. This gene showed a large effect on heading date in the controlled environment experiments, and a smaller, but significant, effect under natural conditions. Eps-A(m)1 showed significant epistatic interactions with photoperiod and vernalization treatments, suggesting that the different classes of genes affecting heading date interact as part of a complex network that controls the timing of flowering induction. Besides its interactions with other genes affecting heading date, Eps-A(m)1 showed a significant interaction with temperature. The effect of temperature was larger in plants carrying the DV92 allele for late flowering than in those carrying the G3116 allele for early flowering. Average differences in heading date between the experiments performed at 16 T and 23 T were approximately I I days (P < 0.001) for the lines carrying the Eps-A(m)1 allele for early flowering but approximately 50 days (P < 0.0001) for the lines carrying the allele for late flowering. The large differences in heading time (average 80 days) observed between plants carrying the G3116 and DV92 alleles when grown at 16 degreesC, suggest that it would be possible to produce very detailed maps for this gene to facilitate its future positional cloning.

AB An F(1) mapping population of the septoria tritici blotch pathogen of wheat, Mycosphaerella graminicola, was generated by crossing the two Dutch field isolates IPO323 and IPO94269. AFLP and RAPD marker data sets were combined to produce a high-density genetic linkage map. The final map contained 223 AFLP and 57 RAPD markers, plus the biological traits mating type and avirulence, in 23 linkage groups spanning 1216 cM. Many AFLPs and some RAPD markers were clustered. When markers were reduced to 1 per cluster, 229 unique positions were mapped, with an average distance of 5.3 cM between markers. Because M. graminicola probably has 17 or 18 chromosomes, at least 5 of the 23 linkage groups probably will need to be combined with others once additional markers are added to the map. This was confirmed by pulsed-field gel analysis; probes derived from 2 of the smallest linkage groups hybridized to two of the largest chromosome-sized bands, revealing a discrepancy between physical and genetic distance. The utility of the map was demonstrated by identifying molecular markers tightly linked to two genes of biological interest, mating type and avirulence. Bulked segregant analysis was used to identify additional molecular markers closely linked to these traits. This is the first genetic linkage map for any species in the genus Mycosphaerella or the family Mycosphaerellaceae.

AB Addition of the long arm of barley chromosome 1H (1HL) to wheat causes severe meiotic abnormalities and complete sterility of the plants. To map the barley gene responsible for the 1H-induced sterility of wheat, a series of addition lines of translocated 1H chromosomes were developed from the crosses between the wheat 'Shinchunaga' and five reciprocal translocation lines derived from the barley line St.13559. Examination of the seed fertility of the addition lines revealed that the sterility gene is located in the interstitial 25% region of the 1HL arm. The genetic location of the sterility gene was also estimated by physically mapping sequence-tagged site (STS) markers and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers with known map locations. The sterility gene is designated Shw ((s) under bar terility in (h) under bar ybrids with (w) under bar heat). Comparison of the present physical map of 1HL with two previously published genetic maps revealed a paucity of markers in the proximal 30% region and non-random distribution of SSR markers. Two inconsistencies in marker order were found between the present physical map and the consensus genetic map of group 1 chromosomes of Triticeae. On the basis of the effects on meiosis and chromosomal location, the relationship of the present sterility gene with other fertility-related genes of Triticeae is discussed.

AB The Q locus is largely responsible for the domestication of bread wheat. Q confers the free-threshing character of the spike and influences other important agronomic traits. Using chromosome deletion lines, Q was placed on the physical map within a submicroscopic segment of the long arm of chromosome 5A. We targeted markers to the segment by comparative mapping of anonymous RFLP clones, AFLP, and mRNA differential display analysis of deletion lines 5AL-7 and -23, which have deletion breakpoints that flank the Q locus. Differentially expressed sequences detected fragments at various loci on group 5 chromosomes suggesting that Q may be a regulatory gene. We identified 18 markers within the Q gene deletion interval and used them to construct a genetic linkage map of the region in F-2 populations derived from chromosome 5A disomic substitution lines. The genetic map corresponding to the deletion segment was 20-cM long, and we identified markers as close as 0.7 cM to the Q gene. An estimate of base pairs per centimorgan within the region is 250 kb/cM, an 18-fold increase in recombination compared with the genomic average. Genomic targeting and high-density mapping provide a basis for the map-based cloning of the Q gene.

AB The Lr20-Sr15-Pm1 resistance locus in hexaploid wheat confers resistance to three different fungal wheat pathogens (leaf rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew). It was previously localized in the distal region of chromosome arm 7AL. As a first step towards the isolation of this complex locus, we performed molecular mapping of the Lr20 and Pm1 genes in three F-2 populations. In two populations, a cluster of 8 and 12 markers, respectively, cosegregated with the resistance genes. In a third population based on a cross between a susceptible lr20 mutant and a resistant cultivar, all clustered markers were monomorphic. However, in this population the recombination frequency proximal to the Lr20 gene was up to 60 times higher, indicating that the complete genetic linkage of the clustered markers is not due to a close physical linkage of the probes but is caused by suppressed recombination. This was supported by the analysis of Triticum monococcum BAC clones where no physical linkage between cosegregating probes was observed. Suppressed recombination at the Lr20-Pm1 locus is likely the result of an alien introgression of chromatin from an unidentified wild relative species or is due to chromosomal rearrangements.

AB Aluminum toxicity is the main factor limiting the productivity of crop plants in acid soils, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. In this study, a doubled-haploid population derived from the rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding lines CT9993 and IR62266 was used to map genes controlling A1 tolerance. A. genetic linkage map consisting of 280 DNA markers (RFLP, AFLP and SSR) was constructed to determine the position and nature of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting AI tolerance. Three characters - control root length (CRL), Al-stressed root length (SRL) and root length ratio (RR) - were evaluated for the DH lines and the parents at the seedling stage in nutrient solution. A total of 20 QTLs controlling root growth under A1 stress and control conditions were detected and distributed over 10 of the 12 rice chromosomes, reflecting multigenic control of these traits. The two QTLs of largest effect, qALRR-1-1 and qALRR-8 for root length ratio (a measurement of Al tolerance) were localized on chromosomes 1 and 8. respectively. Three other QTLs in addition to qALRR-8 were apparently unique in the CT9993 x IR62266 mapping population. which may explain the high level of Al tolerance in CT9993. Comparative mapping identified a conserved genomic region oil chromosome 1 associated with Al tolerance across three rice genetic backgrounds. This region provides ten important starting point for isolating genes responsible for different mechanisms of aluminum tolerance and understanding the genetic nature of this trait in rice and other cereals.

AB Sequences of the intergenic spacer between the 28S and the 5S rDNA genes (IGS 1) were compared for three European isolates belonging to three Puccinia striiformis f. so. tritici races, of different geographic origins and virulence spectra. Two PCR products (IGS 1-1 and IGS 1-2, of 1.3 and 1.1 kb, respectively) were recovered from all spore multiplications. The analysis of IGS 1-1 or IGS 1-2 showed that a low mutational polymorphism existed between the three isolates (from 0.7 to 1.1%) and that each IGS 1 type was characterised by a succession of repetitions. The comparison of IGS 1-1 and IGS 1-2 to each other showed that the polymorphism between the two types of IGS was due to A length polymorphism consisting of a 216 bp insertion/deletion located in the repeated region. Two hypotheses can be proposed to explain the coexistence of two different IGS 1 types within one isolate: either each nucleus of this dikaryotic fungus contains one type of IGS 1 or there are two discrete ribosomal units resulting from recombination in the same nucleus.

AB Nutrient acquisition in chickpea needs to be efficient, because it is mainly grown as a post-rainy season, rainfed crop, and generally on soils inferior in physical characteristics and poor in fertility. Nutrient deficiencies have been reported to cause yield losses of varying magnitude in chickpea, e. g., 22-50% due to iron (Fe), around 10% due to sub-optimal nodulation and hence nitrogen (N) deficiency, 29-45% due to phosphorus (P), up to 100% due to boron (B), and 16-30% due to sulphur (S). Yield losses due to salinity are equally large but are difficult to estimate because of its heterogeneous occurrence. In chickpea, genotypic differences in morpho-physiological (including root size) and functional (exudates) root traits, and in nodulation capacity for increased nitrogen fixation have been identified. Genotypic differences in response to application of Fe, B and zinc (Zn) have also been found among chickpea genotypes. A drought tolerant chickpea genotype ICC 4958, which has a relatively large root system, acquired more P than other genotypes during the vegetative period in a pot experiment at ICRISAT. The recent thrust on identifying QTLs for root size should facilitate progress in incorporating useful root traits through marker assisted selection in desirable agronomic backgrounds. Selection for nodulation capacity in released cultivars has resulted in high nodulating chickpea genotypes that produced 10% higher yield than the control varieties. Information on targeted crop improvement for higher nutrient-use efficiency for P, S, Zn, B and Fe is not readily available. Methods to screen for tolerance to salinity are available, but sufficiently high levels of tolerance have not yet been found in germplasm or wild relatives of chickpea to warrant breeding for salinity tolerance. Use of alternative approaches, such as mutation to generate genetic diversity or introgression of alien genes from other crops (transgenic) are thus required, and these remain long-term objectives.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for three traits related to awning (awn length at the base, the middle and the top of the ear) in wheat were mapped in a doubled-haploid line (DH) population derived from the cross between the cultivars 'Courtot' (awned) and 'Chinese Spring' (awnless) and grown in Clermont-Ferrand, France, under natural field conditions. A molecular marker linkage map of this cross that was previously constructed based on 187 DH lines and 550 markers was used for the QTL mapping. The genome was well covered (more than 95%) and a set of anchor loci regularly spaced (one marker every 20.8 cM) was chosen for marker regression analysis. For each trait, only two consistent QTL were identified with individual effects ranging from 8.5 to 45.9% of the total phenotypic variation. These two QTL cosegregated with the genes Hd on chromosome 4A and B2 on chromosome 6B, which are known to inhibit awning. The results were confirmed using 'Chinese Spring' deletion lines of these two chromosomes, which have awned spikes, while 'Chinese Spring' is usually awnless. No quantitative trait locus was detected on chromosome 5A where the B1 awn-inhibitor gene is located, suggesting that both 'Courtot' and 'Chinese Spring' have the same allelic constitution at this locus. The occurrence of awned speltoid spikes on the deletion lines of this chromosome suggests that 'Chinese Spring' and 'Courtot' have the dominant B1 allele, indicating that B1 alone has insufficient effect to induce complete awn inhibition.

AB The Pm3 resistance locus, located on chromosome 1A in wheat, confers race-specific resistance to the obligate biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis (DC) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici , the causal agent of powdery mildew. Several Pm3 alleles are still effective in controlling the disease in Europe. A genetic map was constructed to map the Pm3g allele in the recombinant inbred line progeny from the cross 'RE9001' (susceptible) x 'Courtot' (resistant). Two microsatellite markers were closely mapped to Pm3g . The PSP2999 marker, which cosegregates with this allele, was shown to detect the presence of the Pm3g resistance allele in other cultivars. A collection of 56 wheat cultivars or advanced lines carrying one Pm3 allele was used to assess the allele-specific amplification of the PSP2999 marker. The same amplification pattern was obtained for lines with Pm3a , Pm3b , Pm3e , Pm3f and Pm3g alleles. Twenty genotypes carrying Pm3d showed a specific amplification pattern. This marker allowed the detection of the Pm3d allele in highly resistant lines whose resistance gene combinations were unknown. It was concluded that PSP2999 is a useful marker to detect Pm3 alleles in parents and to manage them in breeding programmes.

AB An efficient in vitro propagation method using enhanced axillary branching cultures produced plants from nodal explants of three mature, elite tea clones: diploid UPAS1 26 and UPASI 27 (2n=2x=30) representing Camellia sinensis (China type) and triploid UPASI 3 (2n=3x=45) representing C. assamica ssp. assamica (Assam-India type). The genetic fidelity of the micropropagated plants of these three tea clones was assessed by analysing their nuclear, mitochondrial (mt), and chloroplast (cp) genomes using multiple molecular DNA markers. A total of 465, 446 and 462 genetic loci were produced with RFLP, RAPD and ISSR fingerprinting in the micropropagated plants and the corresponding mother plant of C. sinensis clone U (UPASI) 26, and C. assamica ssp. assamica clones U3 and U27, respectively. RFLP fingerprinting was performed using six restriction endonuclease digests and 14 mt and cp gene probes in 84 enzyme-probe combinations. For PCR fingerprinting, 50 RAPD and SSR primers were used for amplifications. The micropropagated plants of both the U3 and U27 clones revealed complete stability in the 462 and 446 genetic loci analysed. In comparison, 36 (7.7%) of the 465 loci were polymorphic among micropropagated plants of the U26 clone. The observed polymorphic loci were not restricted to a particular genome (nuclear or organellar), although a relatively low (7.43%) level of polymorphism was observed in the nuclear as compared to the mt genome (16.3%). ISSR fingerprinting (12.8%) detected more polymorphic loci than RAPD fingerprinting (4.28%). No polymorphism was observed in the cp genome of the micropropagated plants of the three tea clones. The rigorous screening of nuclear and two organellar genomes has demonstrated, for the first time, subtle genetic variation at the DNA sequence level in organized meristem-derived micropropagated plants of tea. Clearly, this is another example demonstrating that organized meristem cultures are not always genetically true-to-type. The genomic changes in tea clones are genotype dependent rather than culture condition dependent.

AB Although cold and drought adaptation in cereals and other plants involve the induction of a large number of genes, inheritance studies in Triticeae (wheat [Triticum aestivum], barley [Hordeum vulgare], and rye [Secale cereale]) have revealed only a few major loci for frost or drought tolerance that are consistent across multiple genetic backgrounds and environments. One might imagine that these loci could encode highly conserved regulatory factors that have global effects on gene expression; therefore, genes encoding central regulators identified in other plants might be orthologs of these Triticeae stress tolerance genes. The CBF/DREB1 regulators, identified originally in Arabidopsis as key components of cold and drought regulation, merit this consideration. We constructed barley cDNA libraries, screened these libraries and a barley bacterial artificial chromosome library using rice (Oryza sativa) and barley Cbf probes, found orthologs of Arabidopsis CBF/DREB1 genes, and examined the expression and genetic map location of the barley Cbf3 gene, HvCbf3. HvCbf3 was induced by a chilling treatment. HvCbf3 is located on barley chromosome 5H between markers WG364b and saflp58 on the barley cv Dicktoo x barley cv Morex genetic linkage map. This position is some 40 to 50 cM proximal to the winter hardiness quantitative trait locus that includes the Vrn-1H gene, but may coincide with the wheat 5A Rcg1 locus, which governs the threshold temperature at which cor genes are induced. From this, it remains possible that HvCbf3 is the basis of a minor quantitative trait locus in some genetic backgrounds, though that possibility remains to be thoroughly explored.

AB Phomopsis stem blight (PSB) caused by Diaporthe toxica is a major disease in narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.). The F-2 progeny and the parental plants from a cross between a breeding line 75A:258 (containing a single dominant resistance gene Phr1 against the disease) and a commercial cultivar Unicrop (susceptible to the disease) were used for development of molecular markers linked to the disease resistance gene. Two pairs of co-dominant DNA polymorphisms were detected using the microsatellite-anchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) technique. Both pairs of polymorphisms were isolated from the MFLP gels, re-amplified by PCR, sequenced, and converted into co-dominant, sequence-specific and PCR-based markers. Linkage analysis by MAPMAKER suggested that one marker (Ph258M2) was 5.7 centiMorgans (cM) from Phr1, and the other marker (Ph258M1) was 2.1 cM from Ph258M2 but further away from Phr1. These markers are suitable for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in lupin breeding.

AB Comparative sequence analysis of the resistance gene analog (RGA) marker locus aACT/CAA (originally found to be tightly linked to the multiallelic barley Mla cluster) from genomes of barley, wheat and rye revealed a high level of relatedness among one another and showed high similarity to a various number of NBS-LRR disease resistance proteins. Using the sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RGA marker aACT/CAA was mapped on group IS chromosomes of the Triticeae and was associated with disease resistance loci. In barley and rye, the marker showed linkage to orthologous powdery mildew resistance genes Mla1 and Pm17, respectively, while in wheat linkage with a QTL against fusarium head blight (FHB) disease was determined. The use of RGA clones for R gene mapping and their role in the expression of qualitative and quantitative resistance is discussed.

AB Barley is the most sensitive among the cereals to aluminium (Al) stress and breeding for more tolerant cultivars is a priority. To enhance selection efficiency for Al tolerance in barley, PCR-based AFLP and microsatellite markers linked to a locus conferring tolerance to aluminium were identified. The study used F-2 progeny derived from a single cross between Yambla (moderately tolerant of Al) and WB229 (tolerant of Al) and developed hydroponic pulse-recovery screening methods to assess tolerance of phenotypes based on root growth. The segregation ratios of tolerant and sensitive genotypes and F-3 progeny testing suggest that a single major gene controlled Al tolerance (Alt). In order to determine the chromosomal location of the Alt gene, we used the AFLP technique coupled with bulk segregant analysis. We evaluated tolerant and sensitive bulks using 30 combinations of EcoRI/MseI primers, and 12 of these permitted differentiation of the sensitive and tolerant bulks. More than 1,000 amplified fragments were obtained, and 98 polymorphic bands were scored. AFLP analysis of wheat-barley chromosome addition lines indicated that the Alt gene was located on barley chromosome 4H. Four chromosome 4H-specific microsatellite markers (Bmac310, Bmag353, HVM68 and HVMCABG) were tightly linked to Alt. The large allelic variation detected with microsatellite marker Bmag353 allowed us to implement this marker for routine marker-assisted selection for Al tolerance, and 396 plants could be screened on a single gel.

AB We have investigated the effect of inflammation on the labeling pattern of cholera toxin B subunit (CTB)-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, an A-fiber marker, by an intra-sciatic nerve injection of the tracer. Following chronic inflammation in one hind paw in rats, there was substantial CTB labeling in lamina 11 of the spinal dorsal horn, which is normally absent. However, there was no change in the labeling pattern of wheat germ agglutinin or fluoride resistant acid phosphatase/thiamine monophosphatase, two C-fiber markers. The CTB labeling in lamina II after peripheral nerve injury has been interpreted as central sprouting of A-fibers or uptake of the tracer by injured C-fibers. Our results suggest that chronic inflammation and nerve injury may share some common mechanisms in generating allodynia and hyperalgesia. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB The basic unit of conservation in vogue is the morpho-species, where the role of genetics is concerned with the assessment of diversity for single loci or random DNA sequences. However, to underpin the evolutionary potential at population level it is of utmost importance that chromosomal divergence is duly taken into account in a conservation programme. Cryptic/cytotypic/ploidy variations are common in vegetative populations that influence genetic architecture and reproductive potential, but may not be immediately recognizable in a phenotype and also escape screening through random DNA markers. Further issues arise in planning management action for conservation when there is intraspecific cytological variation and the populations of cytotypes are spatially separated It is in this context that the chromosomes have a definite role in elucidating the biodiversity and defining population groups for conservation. Combined with cytological markers, a simple approach of comparative chromosome painting resolved by in situ hybridization with genomic DNA of a reference species could unequivocally,facilitate micro-identification of numerical and/or cryptic chromosome diversity, and help complement conservation plans.

AB Gossypium hirsutum L. and G. barbadense L. are the two cultivated tetraploid species of cotton. The first is characterized by a high yield and wide adaptation, and the second by its super fiber property. Substitution line in which a pair of intact chromosomes of TM-1 ( G. hirsutum) were replaced by a pair of homozygous chromosomes of 3-79 ( G. barbadense) is an excellent material for genetic research and molecular tagging. In this study, substitution line 16 (Sub 16) was used to evaluate the performance of the 16th chromosome in G. barbadense in TM-1 background. The genetic analysis using the major gene plus polygene mixed inheritance model in F-2:3 family revealed that there might exist 2 QTLs respectively for boll size, lint percentage, lint index, fiber length and the first fruit branch node, 1 QTL for fiber elongation and flowering date, and no QTL for seed index, fiber strength and Micronaire in chromosome 16. However, 9 QTLs (LOD (logarithm of odds) greater than or equal to 3.0) controlling 6 quantitative traits were significantly identified in linkage group of chromosome 16 constructed in (TM-1 x 3-79) F-2 by interval mapping. Among them, 1 QTL for boll size, fiber length, flowering date and fiber elongation could explain 15.2%, 19.7% 9 12.1%, and 11.7% phenotypic variance respectively, 2 QTLs for lint index could explain 11.6% and 41.9%, and 3 QTLs for lint percentage could plain 8.7%, 9.6% and 29.2% phenotypic variance respectively. One unlinked SSR marker was associated with one QTL respectively for boll size and flowering date and they could explain 1.60% and 4.63% phenotypic variance. The traits associated significantly with chromosome 16 from Sub 16 were boll weight, lint percentage lint index, fiber length, fiber elongation and flowering days.

AB This study demonstrates a successful application of RNA fingerprinting-differential display technique in identifying expressed sequence markers for a small targeted region of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome. Wheat genes are present in clusters spanning about 10% of the genome. One of the important gene-rich regions is present on the short arm of wheat homoeologous group 1 chromosomes around fraction length 0.8 ('1S0.8 region'). The region is about 0.1% of the wheat genome and is flanked by the breakpoints of deletion lines 1BS-4 and 1BS-19. The objective of this study, was to identify expressed sequence markers for the region. First-strand cDNA of poly A(+) mRNA pooled from various developmental stages of the two deletion lines were PCR amplified in the presence of S-35 by means of 90 pair-wise combinations of 19 primers. Amplification products were size-separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide urea gel. A total of 6840 fragment bands were amplified, of which 65 were present in the deletion line 1BS-4, but missing in 1BS-19. These 65 fragment bands were cut out of the gel, reamplified, and used as probes for gel-blot DNA analysis of group 1 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and the two deletion lines. Nineteen of the 65 fragment bands detected a smear pattern and thus were not mapped. Of the remaining 46 probes, 22 mapped to wheat homoeologous group 1 and seven mapped to the '1S0.8 region'. The same approach can be used to target other wheat gene-rich regions bracketed by deletion breakpoints.

TI Development of a scar marker for the Ph1 locus in common wheat and its

ID MOLECULAR MARKERS; GENE
AB To facilitate wheat breeding with the Ph1 gene, 19 sequence tagged-polymerase chain reaction (STS-PCR) primers developed previously from barley chromosome 5H were screened. One pair of STS-PCR primers differentiated 'Chinese Spring' (CS, Ph1) and the CS mutant (ph1b). The diagnostic fragment was 920 base pairs (bp) in size, designated as ABC(920), and was located on the interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5B of ph1b mutant. Plants with or without the Ph1 gene could be distinguished among 148 F-2/97 BC1 plants from the cross CS (Ph1) x CS mutant (ph1b) on the basis of the presence or absence of this fragment. Subsequently, two 24-mer sequence characterized amplified regions (SCAR) primers were developed on the basis of sequences at both ends of the ABC920 fragment to generate a single amplified band in plants with the Ph1 genotype. The Ph1 and ph1b genotypes can be readily scored in the PCR products of individual plant DNA. This SCAR marker (SCABC(823)) was used to facilitate the transfer of the ph1b locus into an elite wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar. This marker is expected to aid in gene transfer between wheat and its wild relatives.

AB PCR amplification and protein analysis of pinA and pinB, the two components of friabilin, a marker protein for grain softness, were carried out in one hundred varieties from India and forty varieties from Kansas State, USA. Glycine to serine change in pinB or null mutation in pinA (absence of gene) has been reported linked with grain hardness. Here we report that majority of Kansas State hard wheats possess glycine to serine mutation in pinB and few have null mutation in pinA. In contrast, majority of varieties released in India are hard and have null mutation in pinA. There are some exceptions where some hard wheats in India do not exhibit either null mutation in pinA or glycine to serine change in pinB. There might be some additional mutations that are to be characterised in elucidating the molecular basis of hardness for usage in genetic engineering. PinA and pinB genes have been assigned on the distal part of 5D short arm using deletion lines of chinese spring wheat where hardness gene Ha is reported to be present.

AB Genomic DNA of twenty four accessions belonging to seven small millet species were analyzed for RAPD, RFLP and AFLP profiles for a comprehensive understanding of the level of genetic diversity within the species and relationships between them. Thirty random primers generated a total of 115 amplification products of which 70 were polymorphic across all species. Twenty-five probe enzyme combinations were used for RFLP analysis that revealed 87 loci of which 62 were polymorphic across the species. AFLP analysis was done at inter-specific level using 12 primer combinations. This generated a total of 869 fragments of which 821 were polymorphic across the species analyzed. Species-specific AFLP profiles were obtained in 10 of the 12 primer combinations tested. It was noticed that the intra-specific variability in all the RAPD and RFLP marker systems was negligible. Species-specific polymorphic loci were observed for all the marker systems. The results are discussed in relation to the genetic relationship among the seven species analyzed.

AB Seven monosomic addition plants, each containing the full complement of Nicotiana plumbagin folia (2n = 20, genome constitution PP) and an aberrant chromosome of Nicotiana sylvestris (2n = 24, SS), were produced from backcrosses of hyperdiploid derivatives of the sesquidiploid hybrid PPS to N. plumbagin folia. The N. sylvestris chromosomes in these plants were characterized by karyotype analysis, Southern hybridization with DNA markers previously localized on N. sylvestris chromosomes and a 269-bp fragment from the 3' end of 25S rDNA, and fluorescence in situ hybridization using 25S rDNA, 5S rDNA and telomere repeats (TTTAGGG)(n) as probes. The N. sylvestris chromosomes in these plants were identified to be telocentrics 6S, 7S and 8S, and deletions 7S, 10, 12S and 12L, respectively. The successful identification of aberrant chromosomes in these lines enabled us to assign DNA markers to arms and sub-arm regions of N. sylvestris chromosomes. All aberrant chromosomes in the addition lines could be transmitted through mitosis and meiosis. The potential applications of the addition lines in high-resolution physical mapping, the isolation of N. sylvestris chromosomes by flow cytometry, and an understanding of the chromosomal distribution of 45S rDNA in N. sylvestris are discussed.

AB The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to locate RAPD markers using disomic wheat-rye addition lines in order to develop a set of molecular markers distributed on the seven rye chromosomes. We carried out RAPD amplifications on genomic DNA of wheat 'Chinese Spring' (CS), rye 'Imperial' (I), the amphiploid wheat-rye and the seven disomic wheat-rye addition lines (1R-7R) using 140 different 10-mer oligonucleotides. Forty six new RAPD markers were located on the seven rye chromosomes and all the disomic wheat-rye addition lines were identified on the basis of their amplification patterns. The number of RAPD bands located on 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R and 7R chromosomes were 5, 8, 11, 8, 8, 10 and 6, respectively. The seven wheat-rye addition lines can be distinguished using only the following three 10-mer oligonucleotides: OPA16, OPF19 and GEN3-605, the other RAPD primers being useful for this purpose. The use of these RAPDs as a source of molecular markers that could be linked to interesting genes or other important agronomic traits is discussed.

AB Comparative mapping of cereals has shown that chromosomes of barley, wheat, and maize can be described in terms of rice "linkage segments." However, little is known about marker order in the junctions between linkage block, or whether this will impair comparative analysis Of major genes that lie in such regions. We used genetic and physical mapping to investigate the relationship between the distal part of rice chromosome 7L which contains the Hd2 heading date gene, and the region of barley chromosome 2HS containing the PPd-H1 photoperiod response gene, which lies near the junction between rice 7 and rice 4 linkage segments. RFLP markers were mapped in maize to identify regions that might contain Hd2 or Ppd-H1 orthologs. Rice provided useful markers for the Ppd-H1 region but comparative mapping was complicated by loss of colinearity and sequence duplications that Predated the divergence of rice, maize. and barley. The sequences of cDNA markers were used to search for homologs in the Arabidopsis genome. Homologous sequences were found for 13 out of 16 markers but they were dispersed in Arabidopsis and did not identify, any candidate equivalent region. The implications of the results for comparative trait mapping in junction regions are discussed.

AB The genetic segregation of the heading trait was analyzed using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) of einkorn wheat, RILWA-1, derived from cultivated Triticum monococcum L., and wild-type T. boeoticum Boiss. The latency to heading was examined in 115 lines under controlled environmental conditions, as well as in the field, and the degrees of narrow-sense earliness and vernalization requirement were evaluated for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Single-marker analysis using 107 RFLP markers segregating in RILWA-1 detected 20 linking markers for heading factors. In all marker loci, the alleles for early heading were conferred by T. monococcum. In interval analysis of chromosome 5A(m), two vernalization genes, Vrn-A(m)1 and Vrn-A(m)2, were precisely mapped to the Xcdo504-Xpsr426 interval on the central region of the long arm and to the Xwg114-Xwec87 interval on its distal region, respectively. Interval analysis also showed that two genes for narrow-sense earliness, designated Nse-3A(m) and Nse-5A(m), were located on chromosome 3A(m) and 5A(m), respectively. It was noticed that heading time in the field was determined mainly by Nse-3A(m), suggesting that narrow-sense earliness is critical for heading in the field in einkorn wheat.

AB Endosperm texture has a tremendous impact on the end-use quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Cultivars of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a close relative of wheat, also vary measurably in grain hardness. However, in contrast to wheat, little is known about the genetic control of barley grain hardness. Puroindolines are endosperm-specific proteins found in wheat and its relatives. In wheat, puroindoline sequence variation controls the majority of wheat grain texture variation. Hordoindolines, the puroindoline homologs of barley, have been identified and mapped. Recently, substantial allelic variation was found for hordoindolines among commercial barley cultivars. Our objective was to determine the influence of hordoindoline allelic variation upon grain hardness and dry matter digestibility in the 'Steptoe' x 'Morex' mapping population. This population is segregating for hordoindoline allele type, which was measured by a HinA/HinB/Gsp composite marker. One-hundred and fifty lines of the 'Steptoe' x 'Morex' population were grown in a replicated field trial. Grain hardness was estimated by near-infrared reflectance (NIR) and measured using the single kernel characterization system (SKCS). Variation attributable to the HinA/HinB/Gsp locus averaged 5.7 SKCS hardness units (SKCS U). QTL analysis revealed the presence of several areas of the genome associated with grain hardness. The largest QTL mapped to the HinA/HinB/Gsp region on the short arm of chomosome 7 (5H). This QTL explains 22% of the SKCS hardness difference observed in this study. The results indicate that the Hardness locus is present in barley and implicates the hordoindolines in endosperm texture control.

AB The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), is the most economically damaging aphid pest of wheat in the southern Great Plains of the USA. In this study, the single, dominant greenbug resistance gene, Gb3 , was molecularly tagged and genetically mapped using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Three AFLP loci were associated with the Gb3 locus in linkage analysis with 75 F (2) (:) (3) families from the cross between two near-isogenic lines (NILs) for Gb3 , `TXGBE273' and `TXGBE281'. Two of these loci, XMgccPagg and XMaggPatg cosegregate with Gb3 in the population analysed. Further analysis indicated that XMgccPagg and XMaggPatg are specific for the Gb3 locus in diverse genetic backgrounds. Two SSR markers, Xgwm111 and Xgwm428 previously mapped in wheat chromosome 7D, were shown to be linked with Gb3 , 22.5 cM and 33.1 cM from Gb3 , respectively, in an F-2 population of `Largo' x `TAM 107', suggesting that Gb3 is located in the long arm of chromosome 7D. The two AFLP markers cosegregating with Gb3 are valuable tools in developing molecular markers for marker-assisted selection of greenbug resistance in wheat breeding.

AB A sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker has been developed for a gene conferring yellow rust resistance originating from the wheat cultivar Moro. The single, dominant, seedling yellow rust resistance gene, designated YrMoro, was mapped to the group 1 chromosomes. The STS marker was developed from an AFLP band which cosegregated with the YrMoro gene. Sequence-specific primers were made which incorporated the selective bases of the AFLP primers, plus 16 and 17 additional bases extending into the AFLP band. This simple, PCR-based marker will allow wheat breeders to pyramid this resistance gene, along with other resistance genes, into a single wheat genotype.

AB The short arm of rye (Secale cereale) chromosome 1 has been widely used in breeding programs to incorporate new disease resistance genes into wheat. Using wheat-rye translocation and recombinant lines, molecular markers were isolated and mapped within chromosomal regions of 1RS carrying rust resistance genes Lr26, Sr31, Yr9 from 'Petkus' and SrR from 'Imperial' rye. RFLP markers previously mapped to chromosome 1HS of barley - flanking the complex Mla powdery mildew resistance gene locus - and chromosome 1DS of Aegilops tauschii - flanking the Sr33 stem rust resistance gene - were shown to map on either side of rust resistance genes on 1RS. Three non cross-hybridising Resistance Gene Analog markers, one of them being derived from the Mla gene family, were mapped within same region of 1RS. PCR-based markers were developed which were tightly linked to the rust resistance genes in 'Imperial' and 'Petkus' rye and which have potential for use in marker-assisted breeding.

AB The value of osmotic adjustment (OA) as a trait which can contribute effectively to yield maintenance under drought, has not been established for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). We screened a set of 25 inbred lines reputed to differ for drought tolerance for OA expressed in the 8-leaf stage; crossed the extreme lines (high and low OA); and selected four individuals (two high OA, two low OA) from the F2 population derived from this cross. Crops of F3 families obtained by self-pollination of these individuals were grown under a rain-out shelter and subjected to a 30-day drought ending at anthesis. High OA families expressed greater OA(ft) [OA at full turgor, estimated as the difference in osmotic potential between droughted and control treatments] than low OA families at the end of the drought period (0.23 MPa vs. 0.04 MPa). Crops of high OA families extracted more water from the profile during the stress period (117 mm vs. 63 mm) had greater shoot biomass and harvest index (HI) at physiological maturity, and greater grain yield (ca. 30%). There was no effect of OA on these variables in the irrigated controls. Grain size, rather than grain number, was the yield component most affected by level of OA. Yield maintenance under drought conditions was attributable to variations in post-drought shoot biomass increase and HI increase. We conclude that OA can contribute to drought tolerance in sunflower and stress the need to develop markers for this trait. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like substance in the optic lobe cortex and retina of the octopus was examined immunohistochemically. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a retrograde-transporting marker, was also used to label the centrifugal neurons. CGRP-immunoreactive (CGRP-IR) somata were seen in the inner granular cell layer, but not in the outer granular cell layer or the retina. CGRP-IR fibers were seen not only in the optic lobe cortex, but also in the retinal nerve plexus. Retrogradely labeled somata were seen in the inner granular cell layer, but not in the outer granular cell layer. Immunohistochemical double staining indicated that WGA-labeled centrifugal neurons were immunopositive for CGRP. These results suggested that the centrifugal neurons in the octopus optic lobe cortex are CGRP-like peptide-containing neurons, and that the peptide may modulate photoreceptor cell functions.

AB Grain protein concentration is an important determinant of grain quality in many crops, including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). While high grain protein percentage might be desirable in barley destined for monogastric feed, low grain protein concentration is desirable for malt and beer production. Low grain protein concentration is associated with increased levels of malt extract and reduced problems with beer chill haze. Molecular markers were used to map and characterize the genes responsible for low, stable grain protein concentration in a recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between 'Karl' (CIho 15487). a low grain protein six-rowed barley, and Lewis' (Clho 15856), a standard two-rowed cultivar. Three major quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified which impacted grain protein percentage. Two of these grain protein effects appeared to result from gene action impacting flowering date. This pleiotropic relationship may be the main reason agronomically acceptable, low protein cultivars have yet to be released.

AB Two sources were evaluated for the production of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers for oat (A vena spp.). First, nucleotide sequences were determined for 250 unique clones from oat microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries. Forty-four of the 63 primer pairs designed were functional, of which 18 (41%) were polymorphic among 13 A vena species and six (14%) were polymorphic between oat cultivars Kanota and Ogle. Second, primers were designed from the sequences of six cDNA fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes. Primer pairs from all six cDNA clones were polymorphic among the 13 A vena species, three A ere polymorphic between Kanota and Ogle, but only one was polymorphic directly between 'Clintland 64' and JL86-5698. However, by cloning and sequencing the PCR products from Clintland 64 and IL86..5698, it was possible to identify nucleotide sequence differences at restriction enzyme cutting sites in DNA fragments from two other primer pairs. Using the two types of markers. we placed nine loci on the hexaploid oat restriction RFLP map. The RFLP-derived markers often mapped to the same or similar positions as the corresponding RFLP markers within and between mapping populations. The sequence analysis also revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) not at restriction enzyme cutting sites. Since multiple SNPs could be detected even within genes and the techniques for the development of SNPs and microsatellites are similar, it may be possible to identify more informative SNP markers than microsatellites from the same type of analysis.

AB We used structural genomic resources for Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench to target acid develop multiple molecular cytogenetic probes that would provide extensive coverage for a specific chromosome of sorghum. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing molecular markers mapped across sorghum linkage group A were labeled as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Signals from single-, dual-, and multiprobe BAC-FISH to spreads of mitotic chromosomes and pachytene bivalents were associated with the largest sorghum chromosome, which bears the nucleolus organizing region (NOR). The order of individual BAC-FISH loci along the chromosome was fully concordant to that of marker loci along the linkage map. In addition, the order of several tightly linked molecular markers was clarified by FISH analysis. The FISH results indicate that markers from the linkage map positions 0.0-81.8 cM reside in the short arm of chromosome I whereas markers froth 81.8-242.9 cM are located in the long arm of chromosome 1. The centromere and NOR were located in a large heterochromatic region that spans similar to60% of chromosome 1. In contrast, this region represents only 0.7% of the total genetic map distance of this chromosome. Variation in recombination frequency among euchromatic chromosomal regions also was apparent. The integrated data underscore the value of cytological data, because minor errors and uncertainties in linkage maps can involve huge physical regions. The successful development of multiprobe FISH cocktails suggests that it is feasible to develop chromosome-specific "paints" from genomic resources rather than flow sorting or microdissection and that when applied to pachytene chromatin, such cocktails provide an especially powerful framework for mapping. Such a molecular cytogenetic infrastructure would be inherently cross-linked with other genomic tools and thereby establish a cytogenomics system with extensive utility in development and application of genomic resources, cloning, transgene localization, development of plant "chromonomics," germplasm introgression, and marker-assisted breeding. In combination with previously reported work, the results indicate that a sorghum cytogenomics system would be partially applicable to other gramineous genera.

AB A molecular genetic map was constructed and an electrophoretic karyotype was resolved for Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch of barley and wheat. The genetic map consists of 27 linkage groups with 97 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, 31 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, two polymerase chain reaction amplified markers, the mating type locus (CsMAT), and a gene (VHv1) conditioning high virulence on barley cv. Bowman. These linkage groups covered a map distance of 849 cM. The virulence gene VHv1 cosegregated with six AFLP markers and was mapped on one of the major linkage groups. Fifteen chromosome-sized DNAs were resolved in C. sativus isolates ND93-1 and ND90Pr with contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis combined with telomere probe analysis of comigrating chromosome-sized DNAs. The chromosome sizes ranged from 1.25 to 3.80 Mbp, and the genome size of the fungus was estimated to be approximately 33 Mbp. By hybridizing genetically mapped RFLP and AFLP markers to CHEF blots, 25 of the 27 linkage groups were assigned to specific chromosomes. The barley-specific virulence locus VHv1 was localized on a chromosome of 2.80 Mbp from isolate ND90Pr in the CHEF gel. The total map length of the fungus was estimated to be at least 1,329 cM based on the map distance covered by the linked markers and the estimated gaps. Therefore, the physical to genetic distance ratio is approximately 25 kb/cM. Construction of a high-resolution map around target loci will facilitate the cloning of the genes conferring virulence and other characters in C sativus by a map-based cloning strategy.

AB Al was shown to elicit the induction of several pathogenesis-related genes, suggesting that a common signalling pathway may be involved in the early response to Al and pathogens. However, we found no evidence of oxidative burst involving either H2O2 or O-2(-) during the first hours of Al exposure distinguishing the early response to Al from a common response to pathogen infection. We identified a strong superoxide dismutase insensitive nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction activity in the root tips of control plants. This activity was rapidly inhibited by Al exposure in the meristematic/distal transition zones of roots in all species examined. In wheat (Triticuin aestivum), the inhibition of NBT reduction occurred in less than 1 min in vivo suggesting that Al either directly blocks an enzyme responsible for NBT reduction, or affects a signal pathway involved in the regulation of this activity. The sensitivity of NBT reduction to KCN and NaN3 suggests that an enzymatic, rather than a chemical reaction is involved. In tolerant plants, the inhibition of NBT reduction caused by Al was reversed within 24 h of exposure. The level of recovery was a function of the degree of Al tolerance. We show that NBT reduction is a simple biochemical marker allowing the rapid identification of tolerant individuals within a segregating population.

AB Transformation of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) with Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 containing a rice chitinase gene under control of the maize ubiquitinI promoter and the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (bar) and hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) genes as selectable markers is described. Epicotyl explants from 2- to 3-week-old ginseng seedlings were pre-cultured for 5-7 days on MS medium supplemented with 10 muM alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid and 9 muM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (ND medium) prior to Agrobacterium infection. The explants were either immersed in a bacterial suspension for 20 min or received a 10-mul or 15-mul droplet of bacteria. A co-culture period of 3 or 4 days was provided on ND medium with or without acetosyringone and ascorbic acid. Selection for transformed calli was conducted on ND medium containing 20 mg/l phosphinothricin or 100 mg/l hygromycin over a 10-month period. A maximum callusing frequency of 27.7% was achieved on selection medium when explants were infected by the droplet method and co-cultured on ND medium without acetosyringone and ascorbic acid. Almost 90% of the 32 lines that survived selection were shown to be transformed. Immersion of explants reduced the callusing frequency to 9.3%. The presence of the transgenes was detected by Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The expression of the chitinase gene was demonstrated by reverse transcription PCR and Western analysis. One hundred and two ginseng plantlets were recovered from 11 confirmed transgenic lines. The transgene integration in plantlets of two lines was demonstrated by Southern analysis. This is the first report of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of this important medicinal plant.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), is a serious economic pest of wheat worldwide. Host plant resistance is the preferred method to control RWA infestations. The identification and mapping of RWA-resistant genes and the development of resistant wheat cultivars can be facilitated through the use of molecular markers. In the present study, microsatellite (SSR) markers linked to the RWA-resistant genes Dn4 and DO were identified using several F, mapping populations derived from crosses of susceptible wheat cultivars and resistant sources. Two flanking, microsatellite markers Xgwm106 and Xgwin337 are linked in coupling phase with Dn4 on the short arm of wheat chromosome ID at 7.4 cM and 12.9 cM, respectively. Two other microsatellite markers Xgwm44 and Xgwmlll] are linked to Dn6 in coupling phase near the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 7D at 14.6 cM and 3.0 cM, respectively. This is the first report on the chromosomal location of DO, which proved to be either allelic or tightly linked to DO, Dn2 and Dn5. This result of Dn.6 location contradicts previous reports that Dn6 was independent of DO, Dn2 and Dn5. The linked markers can be conveniently used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs for the identification and/or pyramiding of Dn4 and Dn6 genes.

AB Cochliobolus sativus is a plant pathogenic fungus that causes spot blotch on barley and wheat. Virulence of a pathotype-2 isolate (ND90Pr) on barley cultivar Bowman was previously determined to be controlled by a single locus. To identify DNA markers associated with this virulence locus, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was conducted on 104 progeny isolates derived from a cross between isolates ND90Pr (exhibiting high virulence on Bowman) and ND93-1 (exhibiting low virulence on Bowman). Among 115 AFLP markers identified, 14 were linked to the virulence locus VHv1 in isolate ND90Pr, six of which cosegregated with MO. Two (E-AG/M-CA-207 and E-AG/M-CG-121) of the six co-segregating AFLP markers were cloned and used to probe genomic DNAs from the fungal parents and progeny. Both markers hybridized only with DNAs from ND90Pr and the virulent progeny. These two cloned markers were also used as probes to survey field isolates of C. sativus collected from different regions of the world and again only hybridized to DNAs from isolates that had the same virulence phenotype as ND90Pr. The results of this study indicate that E-AG/M-CA-207 and E-AG/M-CG-121 are closely linked to VHv1 and are unique to isolates carrying the virulence locus. Development of a linkage group, coupled with the identification of closely linked molecular markers, will facilitate the cloning of the virulence gene VHv1 in C. sativus by map-based cloning.

AB Eighty two new loci, mapped with 51 DNA clones, were added to the earlier deletion maps of the homoeologous group-6 short arms of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell., 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). There are now 41, 56 and 52 loci mapped on deletion maps of 6AS, 6BS and 6DS, respectively. The linear order of orthologous loci in all three arms appears to be identical. The majority of the loci are located in the distal one-half of the three arms. There seems to be an increased marker/gene density from the centromeric to the telomeric regions in each arm, and the marker density in comparable physical regions is similar on all three maps. Recombination is not uniformly distributed along the chromosome arms; 60% of recombination occurs in the distal one-third of each arm. Recombination increases from the proximal region to the distal end in a nonlinear pattern. The distribution of loci and recombination along each of the three chromosome arms is highly correlated. Comparison of the 6BS deletion map from this study and a 6HS physical map of barley (Hordeum vulgare L., 2n = 2x = 14, HH) reveals a remarkably similar distribution of recombinogenic and gene-rich regions between the two chromosome arms, suggesting that the distribution patterns of genes may be conserved in the homoeologous group-6 chromosome short arms of wheat and barley. A consensus map of wheat group-6 short arms containing 46 orthologous loci was constructed. Comparison of the consensus map with published linkage maps of Triticeae group-6 chromosome short arms indicates that the linear order of the loci on the maps has been largely conserved. Evidence from this study does not support the existence of a 2BS-6BS reciprocal terminal translocation.

AB Chloroplastic acetyl CoA-carboxylase (ACCase) is the target of widely used, specific graminicide herbicides: cyclohexanediones (CHDs) and aryloxyphenoxypropionates (APPs). Resistance to these compounds is a worldwide, increasing problem. Population genetic studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of this situation and the diffusion of resistance genes within and between weed populations are challenging because biological assays are not adequate for this purpose, and because different mechanisms of resistance confer a similar resistance phenotype. Molecular markers for specifically detecting resistance genes are therefore urgently needed to conduct such studies. For this purpose, we cloned and sequenced the whole gene encoding chloroplastic ACCase in Alopecurus myosuroides Huds. (Black-grass). We identified two point mutations at nucleotide 5,341 that both cause an isoleucine-leucine substitution at position 1,781. Three bi-directional allele-specific PCR assays were developed, each detecting two distinct ACCase alleles with a single PCR reaction. The sensitivity of 1,190 seedlings of A. myosuroides to one CHD and one APP was determined. Genotyping revealed that, although resistant plants were only selected by APPs, the (1,781)Leu ACCase allele is a widespread, dominant gene of resistance to both APPs and CHDs. No other ACCase allele associated with resistance could be identified in this work. Useful applications of allele-specific PCR markers are population genetic studies as well as routine molecular diagnosis of herbicide resistance.

AB Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify the degree of plant-to-plant outcrossing and pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) in wild oat. The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which pollen movement could contribute to the spread of herbicide resistance in this species. In both experiments, an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor-resistant (R) wild oat genotype (UM1) was used as the pollen donor and a susceptible (S) genotype (UM5) was used as the pollen receptor. Hybrid progeny resulting from a cross between UM1 and UM5 were identified using the herbicide resistance trait as a marker. In the plant-to-plant outcrossing experiment, single UM5 plants were closely surrounded by 20 homozygous R UM1 plants in hills. By screening seed from the S parent for resistance, outcrossing was determined to range from 0 to 12.3%, with a mean of 5.2% over 10 hills. In the PMGF experiment, single homozygous R UM1 plants were surrounded by UM5 plants arranged in a hexagonal pattern at low and high densities (total of 19 and 37 wild oat plants m(-2)), growing within spring wheat and flax crops. In the wheat crop, mean wild oat outcrossing was 0.08 and 0.05% at low and high densities, respectively. In the less competitive flax, corresponding outcrossing values were 0.07 and 0.16% at low and high densities, respectively. Distance from the pollen source was a significant factor only for the high-density planting arrangement in flax. Up to 77 R hybrid seeds were recovered from 6 m(2) in the PMGF experiment, indicating that PMGF contributes to the evolution of resistance in wild oat populations. However, the contribution of pollen movement to resistance evolution and the spread of resistance in wild oat populations would be relatively small when compared with R seed production and dispersal from a resistant plant.

AB LK783 was found to be a good fertility restorer for K-type male sterility of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. 1). RAPD and ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat polymorphism) markers were employed to map the major restoring gene in LK783. Maintainer and restorer DNA pools were established using the extreme sterile and fertile plants among KJ5418A//911289/LK783 F-1 population, respectively. Four hundred and eighteen RAPD primers and 33 ISSR primers were used for screening polymorphisms between the two pools, and amplification bands using a RAPD primer of OPK18 and an ISSR primer of UBC-845 were found polymorphic between the two pools. Linkage analysis showed that OPK18(450) and UBC-845(800) were linked to the restoring gene in LK783. The distance between the restoring gene and OPK18(450) was ( 15.07 +/- 6.28) cM (centiMorgan), with the distance between the restoring gene and UBC-845(800) being ( 8.20 +/- 4.85) cM. The marker of UBC845(800) was located on chromosome 1BS by amplifying nulli-tetrasomics and 1B ditelosomics of Chinese Spring with the primer of UBC-845, indicating that the restoring gene in LK783 was located on 1BS. The breeding for new fertility restorer lines of K-type cytoplasmic male sterility of wheat would be facilitated by using the two markers.

AB We constructed a genetic linkage map of Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum) by crossing complementary nitrate-nonutilizing (nit) mutants of G. zeae strains R-5470 (from Japan) and Z-3639 (from Kansas). We selected 99 nitrate-utilizing (recombinant) progeny and analyzed them for amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). We used 34 pairs of two-base selective AFLP primers and identified 1048 polymorphic markers that mapped to 468 unique loci on nine linkage groups. The total map length is similar to1300 cM with an average interval of 2.8 map units between loci. Three of the nine linkage groups contain regions in which there are high levels of segregation distortion. Selection for the nitrate-utilizing recombinant progeny can explain two of the three skewed regions. Two linkage groups have recombination patterns that are consistent with the presence of intercalary inversions. Loci governing trichothecene toxin amount and type (deoxynivalenol or nivalenol) map on linkage groups IV and I, respectively. The locus governing the type of trichothecene produced (nivalenol or deoxynivalenol) cosegregated with the TRI5 gene (which encodes trichodiene synthase) and probably maps in the trichothecene gene cluster. This linkage map will be useful in population genetic studies, in map-based cloning, for QTL (quantitative trait loci) analysis, for ordering genomic libraries, and for genomic comparisons of related species.

AB This short review outlines the central role of glutamine synthetase (GS) in plant nitrogen metabolism and discusses some possibilities for crop improvement. GS functions as the major assimilatory enzyme for ammonia produced from N fixation, and nitrate or ammonia nutrition. It also reassimilates ammonia released as a result of photorespiration and the breakdown of proteins and nitrogen transport compounds. GS is distributed in different subcellular locations (chloroplast and cytoplasm) and in different tissues and organs. This distribution probably changes as a function of the development of the tissue, for example, GS1 appears to play a key role in leaf senescence. The enzyme is the product of multiple genes with complex promoters that ensure the expression of the genes in an organ- and tissue-specific manner and in response to a number of environmental variables affecting the nutritional status of the cell. GS activity is also regulated post-translationally in a manner that involves 14-3-3 proteins and phosphorylation. GS and plant nitrogen metabolism is best viewed as a complex matrix continually changing during the development cycle of plants. Along with GS, a number of other enzymes play key roles in maintaining the balance of carbon and nitrogen. It is proposed that one of these is glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). There is considerable evidence for a GDH shunt to return the carbon in amino acids back into reactions of carbon metabolism and the tri-carboxylic acid cycle. Results with transgenic plants containing transferred GS genes suggest that there may be ways in which it is possible to improve the efficiency with which crop plants use nitrogen. Marker-assisted breeding may also bring about such improvements.

AB Three types of molecular markers have been compared for their utility in evaluating genetic diversity among cultivars of Hordeum vulgare. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms at 71 sites were scored with the aid of probes corresponding to stress-responsive genes from barley and wheat, coding for a low-molecular weight heat shock protein, a dehydrin, an aldose reductase homolog, and a 18.9-kDa drought-induced protein of unknown function. Indexes of genetic diversity computed in the total sample and within groups of cultivars (two-rowed and six-rowed, winter and spring varieties) indicated high values of genetic differentiation (F-ST > 15%). A second assessment of genetic diversity was performed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using as primers 13 arbitrary oligonucleotides derived from sequences of the same stress-responsive genes. A high degree of polymorphism was uncovered using these markers also, but they yielded low values for FST (< 7%) among groups of cultivars. Finally, 15 different simple-sequence repeats (AC or AG) were amplified with primers based on unique flanking sequences. Levels of polymorphism and differentiation between groups of cultivars revealed by these markers were quite high. Ordination techniques applied to measures of genetic distance among cultivars demonstrated a remarkable ability of the RFLPs associated with stress-responsive genes to discriminate on the basis of growth habit. The correlation with production data for the cultivars in different environments was also significant. This "functional genomics" strategy was therefore as informative as the "structural genomics" (SSR-based) approach, but requires the analysis of fewer probes.

AB Specific resistances to isolates of the ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, which causes Septoria tritici blotch of wheat, have been detected in many cultivars. Cvs, Flame and Hereward, which have specific resistance to the isolate IPO323, were crossed with the susceptible cv. Longbow. The results of tests on F1 and F2 progeny indicated that a single semidominant gene controls resistance to IPO323 in each of the resistant cultivars. This was confirmed in F3 families of Flame x Longbow, which were either homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible, or segregating in tests with IPO323 but were uniformly susceptible to another isolate, IPO94269. None of 100 F2 progeny of Flame x Hereward were susceptible to IPO323, indicating that the resistance genes in these two cultivars are the same, closely linked, or allelic. The resistance gene in cv. Flame was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3A using microsatellite markers and was named Stb6. Fifty-nine progeny of a cross between IPO323 and IPO94269 were used in complementary genetic analysis of the pathogen to test a gene-for-gene relationship between Stb6 and the avirulence gene in IPO323. Avirulence to cvs. Flame, Hereward, Shafir, Bezostaya 1, and Vivant and the breeding line NSL92-5719 cosegregated, and the ratio of virulent to avirulent was close to 1: 1, suggesting that these wheat lines may all recognize the same avirulence gene and may all have Stb6. Together, these data provide the first demonstration that isolate-specific resistance of wheat to Septoria tritici blotch follows a gene-for-gene relationship.

AB The root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus neglectus, is an economically damaging pathogen of wheat and other crops. The development of P. neglectus-resistant wheat cultivars would be greatly accelerated through the use of molecular markers, as resistance phenotyping is extremely time-consuming. A greenhouse bioassay was developed to identify resistance phenotypes of doubled-haploid populations. Bulked-segregant analysis was used to identify AFLP markers linked to P. neglectits resistance in the wheat cultivar Excalibur. One resistance-linked AFLP marker was mapped close to chromosome 7A RFLP markers in a densely-mapped Cranbrook/ Halberd population. One of the chromosome 7A RFLP probes, cdo347, was genotyped in the Tammin/Excalibur population segregating for response to root lesion nematode and showed 8% recombination with the P. neglectus resistance gene Rlnn1. The marker Xcdo347-7A was validated on Excalibur-and Krichauff-derived DH populations segregating for Rlnn1 and showed 14% and 10% recombination, respectively, with Rlnn1 in these populations.

AB Mycelium growth rate is a quantitative characteristic that exhibits continuous variation. This trait has applied interest, as growth rate is correlated with production yield and increased advantage against competitors. In this work we studied growth rate variation in the edible basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus growing as monokaryotic or dikaryotic mycelium on Eger medium or on wheat straw. Our analysis resulted in identification of several genomic regions (quantitative trait loci [QTLs]) involved in the control of growth rate that can be mapped on the genetic linkage map of this fungus. In some cases monokaryotic and dikaryotic QTLs clustered at the same map position, indicating that there are principal genomic areas responsible for growth rate control. The availability of this linkage map of growth rate QTLs can help in the design of rational strain breeding programs based on genomic information.

AB A rapid two-site sandwich ELISA was developed for detection of a previously uncharacterized protein encoded at the Ha locus oil chromosome 5DS of wheat Triticum aestivum). The assay used the combined specificity of two antibodies to detect a protein that as Soluble in aqueous alcohol, salt solutions, and water. It was expressed in the endosperm of all soft wheats and Triticum tauschii accession, tested. The ELISA as highly specific, with no signal obtained with varieties that did not express the protein. The presence of the 5DS-encoded protein correlated with a significant change in both water absorption and average hardness and particle size indices in a doubled haploid population derived from a cross between (vs. Cranbrook x Halberd. Only sonic hard varieties expressed this protein indicating that the protein is not predictive for hardness. However. it may be a new factor, or a marker for a new factor, affecting kernel texture. A polypeptide of M-r 66000 was purified from an extract of Halberd flour immunoaffinity chromatograph. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence identified it as an albumin with high homolog to both mammalian serum albumins and sucrose synthase from a range of cereals. The assay may be valuable in wheat breeding programmes for assessing kernel texture where the parent, are of different ELISA phenotype. or for varietal identification. as the expression of the polypeptide is variable in hard wheat varieties.

AB Staples are not considered an important source of minerals in the diet. However, because of high staple consumption, any increase in mineral concentration might well have a significant effect on human nutrition and health. The nutritional quality of staple crops (rice, cassava, wheat, maize and beans) can be improved by breeding. Studies have shown the potential to exploit the genetic variation in seed concentration of iron and other minerals without the general negative effect on yield of adding new traits. The relationship between yield and mineral concentration may be positive, particularly in mineral-deficient soil. Initial evaluations have shown that some crop varieties have high Fe, Zn and carotene in their edible portions. The next step for conventional breeding will be to study the genetics of trace mineral inheritance to determine the best selection technique. Initial investigations of the genetics for high iron in rice have indicated a complex mode of inheritance, demonstrating additive and dominant gene and environmental effects. Breeding strategies have been developed based on these genetic findings. The use of biotechnological tools, such as molecular marker-assisted selection, will significantly increase the pace and prospects of success for breeding to improve the nutritional value of staple food crops.

AB Tetrad analysis is a genetic method that can locate genes and centromeres on a linkage map with a high degree of precision. Despite its effectiveness and accuracy, application of this method is generally limited to fungi, algae and mosses. Here we demonstrate a new method of tetrad analysis that is applicable to other organisms. This combines tetrad analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and is thus referred to as tetrad-FISH analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using tetrads of rye, Secale cereale. The rye strain JNK contains interstitial heterochromatin in a region of Chromosome 2R. We have previously cloned the tandemly repeated sequence forming this heterochromatin in the plasmid pScJNK. We performed FISH using pScJNK as the probe on tetrads obtained from heterozygotes for the heterochromatin region. The frequency of tetrads demonstrating positive signals in two cells that are diagonally opposite one another must correspond to the frequency of recombination in the interval between the heterochromatin and the centromere. Comparison between the results of tetrad-FISH analysis and linkage maps based on RFLP markers clearly indicated that heterochromatin strongly suppresses recombination of whole chromosomal regions. We discuss the effectiveness of tetrad-FISH analysis, particularly for the localization of functional centromeres in linkage maps.

AB Impaired sensory perception is a well-established stigma of aging and whereas loss of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is marginal there is a specific pattern of reduced peripheral sensory innervation. To resolve if similar regressive processes occur in the central innervation, peripheral nerves were injected with markers for unmyelinated (isolectin B4) or myelinated (cholera toxin B subunit; CTB) DRG neurons. The results were a dramatic decrease of primary sensory endings in the spinal cord of aged rats following transganglionic labeling with CTB, and also to a lesser degree with B4. profile counting and frequency estimates showed that the reduction of CTB labeled profiles not was caused by impaired axonal uptake, slowed axonal transport of CTB, or by a loss of myelinated fibers in the peripheral nerve. At the ultrastructural level, peripheral nerves showed the classical hallmarks of aging, with more pronounced alterations in myelinated than unmyelinated axons. Taken together, sensory deprivation in senescence appears to be a distal process in DRG neurons involving both peripheral and central target disconnection. Finally, preliminary data indicates that the substantial reduction in mcchanoreceptive input to the central nervous system co-varies with the degree of sensorimotor impairment of the aged individuals.

AB The study used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers to saturate the segment of chromosome I containing a major salt tolerance gone controlling the Na+/K+ ratio. RFLP and SSLP analyses Were conducted to construct linkage maps based on an F-8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population. The RFLP and SSLP linkage maps constructed in this study were found to be in the same order as published maps, implying the reliability of the constructed maps. The Integrated RFLP and SSLP linkage map had a total of 129.9 cM, with an average interval size of 6.8 cM. Two RFLP markers, C52903S and C1733S, with 10.1 and 22.6 cM distance, respectively, flanked the major gone, Saltol. A published RFLP-saturated molecular map based on an F-2 mapping population had a 5 cM interval between the two markers, C52903S and C1733S, which implies that the Saltol marker and the use of less than 80 RILs may be overestimating the distance between the two markers, and hence, the actual location of the salt tolerance gene. Two microsatellite markers, RM23 and RM140, flanked the Saltol gene with 16.4 and 10.1 cM distance, respectively. A common QTL for three quantitative traits (low Na+ absorption, high K+ absorption, and a low Na+/K+ absorption ratio) was observed from position 50 to 65 cM segment of the map with peak LOD score > 6.7. The Na+, K+ and the Na+/K+ absorption ratio QTLs accounted for 39.2, 43.9, and 43.2% of the phenotypic variation. RM140, a microsatellite marker, and C52903S, a RFLP marker, flanked the QTL peak within a 1.9 cM interval.

AB Plant genomics projects involving model species and many agriculturally important crops are resulting in a rapidly increasing database of genomic and expressed DNA sequences. The publicly available collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from several grass species can be used in the analysis of both structural and functional relationships in these genomes. We analyzed over 260 000 EST sequences from five different cereals for their potential use in developing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The frequency of SSR-containing ESTs (SSR-ESTs) in this collection varied from 1.5% for maize to 4.7% for rice. In addition, we identified several ESTs that are related to the SSR-ESTs by BLAST analysis. The SSR-ESTs and the related sequences were clustered within each species in order to reduce the redundancy and to produce a longer consensus sequence. The consensus and singleton sequences from each species were pooled and clustered to identify cross-species matches. Overall a reduction in the redundancy by 85% was observed when the resulting consensus and singleton sequences (3569) were compared to the total number of SSR-EST and related sequences analyzed (24 606). This information can be useful for the development of SSR markers that can amplify across the grass genera for comparative mapping and genetics. Functional analysis may reveal their role in plant metabolism and gene evolution.

AB Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. (2n=2x=14, DD) (syn. A. squarrosa L.; Triticum tauschii) is well known as the D-genome donor of bread wheat (T. aestivum, 2n=6x=42, AABBDD). Because of conserved synteny, a high-density map of the A. tauschii genome will be useful for breeding and genetics within the tribe Triticeae which besides bread wheat also includes barley and rye. We have placed 249 new loci onto a high-density integrated cytological and genetic map of A. tauschii for a total of 732 loci making it one of the most extensive maps produced to date for the Triticeae species. Of the mapped loci, 160 are defense-related genes. The retrotransposon marker system recently developed for cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was successfully applied to A. tauschii with the placement of 80 retrotransposon loci onto the map. A total of 50 microsatellite and ISSR loci were also added. Most of the retrotransposon loci, resistance (R), and defense-response (DR) genes are organized into clusters: retrotransposon clusters in the pericentromeric regions, R and DR gene clusters in distal/telomeric regions. Markers are non-randomly distributed with low density in the pericentromeric regions and marker clusters in the distal regions. A significant correlation between the physical density of markers (number of markers mapped to the chromosome segment/physical length of the same segment in mum) and recombination rate (genetic length of a chromosome segment/physical length of the same segment in mum) was demonstrated. Discrete regions of negative or positive interference (an excess or deficiency of crossovers in adjacent intervals relative to the expected rates on the assumption of no interference) was observed in most of the chromosomes. Surprisingly, pericentromeric regions showed negative interference. Islands with negative, positive and/or no interference were present in interstitial and distal regions. Most of the positive interference was restricted to the long arms. The model of chromosome structure and function in cereals with large genomes that emerges from these studies is discussed.

AB Wheat genes are present in physically small, gene-rich regions, interspersed by gene-poor blocks of retrotransposon-like repetitive sequences. One of the largest gene-rich regions is present around fraction length (FL) 0.8 of the short arm of wheat homoeologous group 1 chromosomes and is called `1S0.8 region'. The objective of this study was to reveal the structural and functional organization of the `1S0.8 region' in various Triticeae and other Poaceae species. Consensus genetic linkage maps of the `1S0.8 region' were constructed for wheat, barley, and rye by combining mapping information from 16, 11, and 12 genetic linkage maps, respectively. The consensus genetic linkage maps were compared with each other and with a consensus physical map of wheat homoeologous group 1. Comparative analyses localized 75 agronomically important genes to the `1S0.8 region'. This high-resolution comparison revealed exceptions to the rule of conserved gene synteny, established using low-resolution marker comparisons. Small rearrangements such as duplications, deletions, and inversions were observed among species. Proportion of chromosomal recombination occurring in the `1S0.8 region' was very similar among species. Within the gene-rich region, the extent of recombination was highly variable but the pattern was similar among species. Relative recombination among markers was similar except for a few loci where drastic differences were observed among species. Chromosomal rearrangements did not always change the extent of recombination for the region. Differences in gene order and relative recombination were the least between wheat and barley, and were the highest between wheat and oat.

AB We studied the effects of the anti-microtubule drug, oryzalin, on the content and spatial organization of reticuloplasmins (Ca2+-binding marker proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum) in winter wheat seedlings after their cold acclimation (3degreesC, 7 days) and treatment with ABA (30 muM). For identification and visualization of reticuloplasmins, we applied one-dimensional SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western blotting and indirect fluorescent microscopy. We used polyclonal HSP70 and CRH antibodies against BiP and calreticulin (Cal), respectively. On immunoblots, the brightest bands corresponded to polypeptides with mol wts of 58 kD (calreticulin) and 79 kD (BiP). The content of calreticulins in roots was shown to be higher than in leaves. Cold acclimation enhanced, and ABA treatment reduced, the concentration of calreticulins in root cells. Both treatments increased the Bid concentration in roots. Oryzalin (10 muM, treatment for 3 h) did not affect the level of reticuloplasmins in roots of unhardened, cold acclimated, treated with ABA and with a combination of cold and ABA plants. However, both oryzalin and low-temperature treatments resulted in the accumulation of reticuloplasmins in the two spherical structures in the vicinity of the plasmalemma and nuclear envelope. After the combined action of oryzalin and low temperature, the cortical sphere of BiP proteins was shifted into the endoplasm and calreticulins appeared in the nuclear matrix. We believe that these changes in the reticuloplasmin localization are related to the rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum determined by the cytoskeleton modification. They result in the improved capacity of reticuloplasmins to control Ca2+ behavior and/or to the function as chaperones. The results obtained permit the conclusion that cytoskeletal proteins interact with reticuloplasmins, and this interaction might be involved in the transduction of the external and internal signals.

AB To identify a molecular marker closely linked to Vrn-B1, the Vrn-1 ortholog on chromosome SB, sequence polymorphism at four orthologous RFLP loci closely linked to the Vrn-1 gene family was analyzed by using near-isogenic lines of "Triple Dirk." At Xwg644, a RFLP locus, three types of nucleotide sequence differing by the number of (TG) repeats, two or three times, and base changes were detected. A (TG)(3)-type sequence proved to be specific to chromosome SB by nulli-tetrasomic analysis, and substitution of single nucleotide (C/T) was detected between TD(B) carrying the former Vrn2 allele and TD(C) carrying the vrn2 allele. A mismatch primer was designed for dCAPS analysis of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Polymorphism was successfully detected between two NILs, through nested PCR by using a (TG)(3)-specific primer (1st) and a dCAPS primer (2nd) followed by a NsiI digest. The analysis of a BF2 population [(TD(B)//TD(C)] revealed the close linkage (1.7 cM) between WG644-SB and Vrn2. It was therefore concluded that the former Vrn2 locus is located on chromosome SB and equivalent to Vrn-B1.

AB Rye (Secale cerenle L.) is considered to be the most aluminum (Al)-tolerant species among the Triticeae. It has been suggested that aluminum tolerance in rye is controlled by three major genes (Alt genes) located on rye chromosome arms 3RL, 4RL, and 6RS, respectively. Screening of an F-6 rye recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between an AI-tolerant rye (M39A-1-6) and an Al-sensitive rye (M77A-1) showed that a single gene controls aluminum tolerance in the population analyzed. In order to identify molecular markers tightly linked to the gene, we used a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and bulked segregant analysis techniques to evaluate the F6 rye RIL population. We analyzed approximately 22,500 selectively amplified DNA fragments using 204 primer combinations and identified three AFLP markers tightly linked to the Alt gene. Two of these markers flanked the Alt locus at distance of 0.4 and 0.7 cM. Chromosomal localization using cloned AFLP and a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)

AB Oat receptor-like kinase gene sequences, homologous to the Lrk10 gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), were mapped in oat (Avena sativa L.). PCR primers designed from the wheat Lrk10 were used to produce ALrk10 from oat. Two DNA sequences, ALrk1A1 and ALrk4A5, were produced from primers designed from coding and non-coding regions of ALrk10. Their use as RFLP probes indicated that the kinase genes mapped to four loci on different hexaploid oat 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' linkage groups (4_12, 5, 6, and 13) and to a fifth locus unlinked to other markers. Three of these linkage groups contain a region homologous to the short arm of chromosome 1 of wheat and the fourth contains a region homologous to chromosome 3 of wheat. Analysis with several nullisomics of oat indicated that two of the map locations are on satellite chromosomes. RFLP mapping in a 'Dumont' x 'OT328' population indicated that one map location is closely linked to Pg9, a resistance gene to oat stem rust (Puccinia graminis subsp. avenae). Comparative mapping indicates this to be the region of a presumed cluster of crown rust (Puccinia coronata subsp. avenae) and stem rust resistance genes (Pg3, Pg9, Pc44, Pc46, Pc50, Pc68, Pc95, and PcX). The map position of several RGAs located on KO6 and KO3s_38 with respect to Lrk10 and storage protein genes are also reported.

AB In wheat, eyespot caused by Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, is one of the main foot-rot diseases. Yield losses up to 40% occur in some years. Plant protection by fungicide application is possible, but a better way is through resistance breeding. Two resistance sources are currently used: Aegilops ventricosa and the old French variety 'Cappelle Desprez'. A new source of resistance has been found in the accession AE120 of Ae. kotschyi from the Gatersleben gene bank with the genome constitution UUSvSv. This accession has been crossed and backcrossed twice to susceptible wheat varieties, and in each generation, plants with a relatively high level of resistance have been selected. From this material, lines have been developed and tested in F-6 to F-8. Finally, several lines could be classified as moderately resistant, such as the French variety 'Cappelle Desprez' after resistance determination during milk ripeness (DC75). No line reached the high resistance level achieved with Pch-1 from Ae. ventricosa. The yield of these lines under infection conditions was higher compared with 'Cappelle Desprez', The line 6018-96-3 showed a high yield of 64.3 dt/ha compared with 59.6 dt/ha, on he average, in combination with the best expression of eyespot resistance in the adult growth stage over 3 years.

AB The biotrophic fungus Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici, a basidiomycete that causes yellow rust on wheat, is spread by wind-dispersed spores. Analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) variation showed that the fungus frequently migrates between the UK, Germany, France and Denmark. There is no biological evidence for sexual or parasexual reproduction under natural conditions, and this was supported by the lack of recombination, as revealed by AFLP, over the time and area represented by the samples in this study. A phylogeographic analysis revealed that there was effectively a single, clonal population in the four countries, up to 1700 km apart, consistent with a 'continent-island' model in which Denmark is the recipient of migrants from other countries. In five cases, specific pathogen clones were dispersed between the UK and Denmark, and on at least two recent occasions clones were also spread from the UK to Germany and France, causing outbreaks of yellow rust on wheat cultivars that were previously resistant to the disease in these countries. The agronomic consequences of migration were enhanced because of the limited genetic diversity for yellow rust resistance in wheat cultivars in the area. These results demonstrate that long-distance migration of pathogen clones, coupled with low diversity in the host species, may cause previously useful resistance genes to become ineffective for disease control on a continental scale.

AB A full length cDNA clone encoding plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cp-FBPase), together with a transit peptide, was isolated from a potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) leaf cDNA library. Potato plants were transformed with the isolated cp-FBPase sequence behind a patatin class I promoter to ensure tuber-specific expression of the enzyme. Plant lines were selected which expressed up to 250 mU (g FW)(-1) in the developing tubers, which is 10- to 20-fold the activity found in wildtype tubers. Intact amyloplasts were isolated from in vitro-grown minitubers developed in darkness. Comparison with marker enzymes showed that cp-FBPase activity in transgenic, tubers, as well as the low FBPase activity in the wild-type tubers, was localised inside the amyloplasts. The intact amyloplasts isolated from both wild-type and transgenic tubers synthesised starch from [U-C-14]glucose-6-phosphate. Conversely, only the transgenic tubers expressing cp-FBPase showed appreciable synthesis of starch from [U-C-14]dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and this synthesis rate was correlated to the activity of cp-FBPase. Thus, the expression of cp-FBPase in tubers allows for a new route of starch biosynthesis from triose-phosphates imported from the cytosol. The transgenic tubers did not differ from wildtype tubers with respect to starch content, or the levels of neutral sugars and phosphorylated hexoses.

AB Cereal centromeres consist of a complex organization of repetitive DNA sequences. Several repetitive DNA sequences are common amongst members of the Triticeae family, and others are unique to particular species. The organization of these repetitive elements and the abundance of other types of DNA sequences in cereal centromeres are largely unknown. In this study, we have used wheat-rye translocation lines to physically map 1BL.1RS centromeric breakpoints and molecular probes to obtain further information on the nature of other types of centromeric DNA sequences. Our results, using the rye-specific centromeric sequence, pAWRC.1. indicate that 1BL.1RS contains a small portion of the centromere from 1R of rye. Further studies used molecular markers to identify centromeric segments on wheat group-1 chromosomes. Selected RFLP markers, clustered around the centromere of wheat homoeologous group-IS chromosomes, were chosen as probes during Southern hybridization. One marker, PSR161, identified a small 1BS segment in all 1BL.1RS lines. This segment maps proximal to pAWRC.1 in 1BL.1RS and on the centromere of 1B. Sequence analysis of PSR161 showed high homology to HSP70 genes and Northern hybridization showed that this gene is constitutively expressed in leaf tissue and induced by heat shock and light stimuli. The significance of this work with respect to centromere organization and the possible significance of this HSP70 gene homologue are discussed.

Four genomic libraries of cultivar 'Chinese Spring' were screened with nine trinucleotide probes. Based on the screening of 28550 clones, the occurrences of (CTT/GAA)(n), (GGA/CCT)(n), (TAA/ATT)(n), (CAA/GTT)(n), (GGT/CCA)(n), (CAT/GTA)(n), (CGA/GCT)(n), (CTA/GAT)(n), and (CGT/GCA)(n) repeats were estimated to be 5.4x10(4), 3.5x10(4), 3.2x10(4), 1.2x10(4), 6.3x10(3), 4.9x10(3), 4.5x10(3), 4.5x10(3) and 3.6x10(3), i.e., once every 293 kbp, 456 kbp, 500 kbp, 1.3 Mbp, 2.6 Mbp, 3.2 Mbp, 3.6 Mbp, 3.6 Mbp and 4.5 Mbp in the wheat genome, respectively. Of 236 clones selected for sequencing, 38 (93%) (TAA/ATT)(n), 30 (43%) (CTT/GAA)(n), 16 (59%) (CAA/GTT)(n), 3 (27%) (CAT/GTA)(n), and 2 (4%) (GGA/CCT)(n) clones contained microsatellites with eight or more perfect repeats. From these data, 29, 27 and 16 PCR primer sets were designed and tested to the (TAA/ATT)(n), (CTT/GAA)(n), and (CAA/GTT)(n) microsatellites, respectively. A total of 12 (41.4%) primers designed to (TAA/ATT)(n), four (14.8%) to (CTT/GAA)(n), and two (12.5%) to (CAA/GTT)(n), resulted in polymorphic markers. The results indicated that (TAA/ATT)(n) microsatellites would provide the most abundant and the most-polymorphic source of trinucleotide microsatellite markers in wheat.

AB Stripe rust resistance was identified in Triticum vavilovii (T. vavilovii Aus22498)-derived Russian wheat aphid (RWA)-resistant germplasm. Inheritance studies indicated monogenic control of resistance. The resistance gene was tentatively designated as Yrvav and was located on chromosome 1 B by monosomic analysis. A close association (1.5+/-0.9% recombination) of Yrvav with a T. vavilovii-derived gliadin allele (Gli-B1vav) placed it in chromosome arm 1BS. Yrvav was allelic with Yr10. Tests with Yr10 avirulent and virulent pathotypes showed that Yrvav and Yr10 possess identical pathogenic specificity. Yrvav and Yr10 showed close genetic associations with alternate alleles at the Xpsp3000 (microsatellite marker), Gli-B1 and Rg1 loci. Based on these observations Yrvav was named as Yr10vav. The close association between Xpsp3000 and Gli-B1 was also confirmed. The Yr10vav-linked Xpsp3000 allele (285 bp) was not present in 65 Australian cultivars, whereas seven Australian wheats lacking Yr10 carried the same Xpsp3000 allele (260 bp) as Yr10 carrying wheat cultivar Moro. Xpsp3000 and/or Gli-B1 could be used in marker-assisted selection for pyramiding Yr10vav or Yr10 with other stripe rust resistance genes. Yr10vav was inherited independently of the T. vavilovii-derived RWA resistance.

AB Inheritance of resistance to covered smut in the barley line Q21861 was studied using a doubled-haploid population produced by crossing Q21861 with the line SM89010. Based on 3 years of screening in the field and two seasons in the greenhouse, segregation for resistance/susceptibility fits a one-gene ratio, indicating a single major gene for resistance in Q21861. Of 440 random 10-mer primers tested using bulked segregant analysis, one primer (OPJ10) resulted in a reproducible polymorphic band. RAPD marker OpJ10(450) co-segregated in repulsion with the covered smut resistance. This marker was converted to a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker linked in coupling (5.5 cM) with the covered smut resistant gone in Q21861. The SCAR marker was amplified in the line TR640 which is also resistant to covered smut, but not in the other resistant lines. The SCAR marker will be useful for marker-assisted selection for covered smut in barley breeding programs.

AB Selective Amplification of Microsatellite Polymorphic Loci (SAMPL) technology was used in bread wheat for the first time for a study of genetic diversity, genotype identification and gene tagging. The diversity studies involved 55 wheat genotypes and two SAMPL primer pairs (SAMPL-6 and SAMPL-7, each with a M-CAG primer), which together gave 43 polymorphic bands out of a total of 87 SAMPL bands. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) of SAMPL primers was 0.221 and that of SAMPL markers was 0.264. The marker index of SAMPL markers was 9.61. The genetic similarity (GS) coefficients for 1,485 pairs of genotypes ranged from 0.35 to 0.96 with an average of 0.65. A dendrogram was prepared on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm, which corresponded well with the results of principal component analysis (PCA). From a total of 55 genotypes, 54 could be distinguished using the SAMPL banding patterns of both primers. For gene tagging, 568 bands from a total of 1,185 SAMPL bands detected polymorphism between each of the three pairs of parents differing for grain protein content (GPC), pre-harvest sprouting tolerance (PHST) and grain weight (GW). An association of six bands with GPC, of seven bands with PHST and four bands with GW was observed using bulked segregant analysis (BSA).

AB The genomes of grasses are very different in terms of size, ploidy level and chromosome number. Despite these significant differences, it was found by comparative mapping that the linear order (colinearity) of genetic markers and genes is very well conserved between different grass genomes. The potential of such conservation has been exploited in several directions, e.g. in defining rice as a model genome for grasses and in designing better strategies for positional cloning in large genomes. Recently, the development of large insert libraries in species such as maize, rice, barley and diploid wheat has allowed the study of large stretches of DNA sequence and has provided insight into gene organization in grasses. It was found that genes are not distributed randomly along the chromosomes and that there are clusters of high gene density in species with large genomes. Comparative analysis performed at the DNA sequence level has demonstrated that colinearity between the grass genomes is retained at the molecular level (microcolinearity) in most cases. However, detailed analysis has also revealed a number of exceptions to microcolinearity, which have given insight into mechanisms that are involved in grass-genome evolution. In some cases, the use of rice as a model to support gene isolation from other grass genomes will be complicated by local rearrangements. In this Botanical Briefing, we present recent progress and future prospects of comparative genomics in grasses. (C) 2002 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Genetic maps containing molecular markers are useful tools for the identification of genes underlying quantitative traits (QTLs). Three traits important for plant physiology, i.e. chlorophyll content, sensitivity to GA and sensitivity to ABA, were evaluated for 99 F-2 families of the DS2 x RXL 10 rye mapping population. The observed variation in the chlorophyll content in rye leaves was shown to be under the genetic control of four independent QTLs. They were located on the following chromosome arms: 1RL (QChc-1R.1), 3RS (QChc-3R.1), 4RL (QChc-4R.1) and 5RL (QChc-5R.1) The marker-assisted selection of recombinants comprising positively-acting alleles at these loci may significantly increase the chlorophyll content in rye leaves, which should result in a higher efficiency of photosynthesis.
   A decreasing of plant height in rye is one of the major aims of breeders selecting for lodging resistance. The polymorphism of genes controlling sensitivity to gibberellic acid may be the basis for a potential selection strategy. Three QTLs underlying the sensitivity of rye seedlings to GA were located on chromosomes 5RL (QGar-5R.1), 1RL (QGar-1R.1) and on 7RL (QGar-7R.1). The dwarfing allele of a Dw1 locus present in line RXL10 was mapped in the same position as the QGar-5R.1 gene.
   Sensitivity to ABA plays an important role in imposing dormancy in rye grain. Three QTLs affecting sensitivity to ABA were found. They were mapped on chromosomes 1RS (QAbr-1R.1), 2R in the centromeric region (QAbr-2R.1) and on 5RL (QAbr-5R.1). QAbr-5R.1, Dw1 and QGar-5R.1 are located in the same position on the distal part of the 5RL chromosome arm, which suggests that they, belong to a single locus for a major regulatory gene controlling the development of rye plants.

AB Molecular markers are modern diagnostic tools, which may help breeders to solve practical problems. They facilitate cultivar identification, the determination of genetic similarities among breeding stocks and enable the calculation of polymorphism level, heterozygosity or self-pollination rate. But the main expectation with respect to molecular markers is their potential use in marker-assisted selection (MAS).
   There are four major strategies of finding a molecular marker tightly linked to a target gene of agronomic importance. The first approach takes advantage of the nearly isogenic lines (NILs) which are differentiated only by the allelic sets in the gene of interest and in the adjacent chromosomal region. The second strategy involves bulked segregant analysis (BSA) for identification of markers linked to a single gene. The third involves the genetic dissection of more complex traits, which leads to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and their markers. The fourth strategy of marker identification includes computer databases (sequence and mapping data). The usefulness of these strategies is discussed in this paper. Some consequences of the application of BSA for gene tagging are described.

AB Ninety-nine different lines of the Doubled-Haploid F2 winter barley population W766 ('Angora' x 'W704/137') were genetically fingerprinted using AFLP, microsatellite, morphological and resistance markers. A preliminary map consisting of seven linkage groups is presented. The map contains a highly distorted region on the long arm of chromosome 3H reflecting preselection of the genotypes for resistance against barley mild mosaic, virus. QTL analysis of morphological and phenological traits yielded 99 significant QTL, with most traits (66.3%) being represented by a single QTL. The distribution of significant QTL over the chromosomes was very uneven, the bulk being placed on the long arm of chromosome 3H and no QTL being found on chromosome 4H. This possibly points to the presence of a strong pleiotropic gene on 3H or of a group of related genes that mask weaker effects that were found on other linkage groups as subsignificant QTL. Using two examples of detected QTL (for tillering and grain number), it is shown how the findings of the QTL analysis could be incorporated into an existing morphological simulation model of barley using simple statistical methods.

AB The aim of this study was to identify the genetic changes in rye seeds induced by natural aging during long-term storage and successive regeneration cycles under gene bank conditions. Genomic DNA from four rye samples (cv. Dankowskie Zlote), varying in their initial viability and having gone through one, or three reproduction cycles, were analysed using specific PCR targeting of a secalin locus, and various repetitive fragments defined by the R173 sequence. A statistical analysis of the band frequencies for both secalin and R173.3 primer pairs revealed no changes in their frequencies. Similar data on R173.1 demonstrated significant changes between samples of different initial viability showing a lack of a band of the expected length (987 bp) in progeny originating from low viability seeds lots. These changes were inherited even after three regeneration cycles. Our results may indicate that long-term storage that leads to loss of viability also generates heritable changes in the preserved germplasm. However, it remains to be discovered where these changes occur and whether they are connected with coding or with non-coding DNA regions.

AB We briefly review the limited application of marker assisted selection in past wheat breeding programmes, and contrast the current situation, where increasingly it has become feasible to tag almost any gene with a microsatellite assay. Although this capability is having an impact on the conduct of large breeding programmes, a much more profound change in breeding strategy will become possible when SNP technology has matured sufficiently so that the throughput of molecular marker-based genotyping will be able to keep pace with the numbers of plants that breeders can handle in the field. We discuss the considerations that will need to be addressed in the generation of a new breeding paradigm to take advantage of the genomics revolution.

AB Twenty-five AFLPs, previously linked to fertility restoration genes for the male-sterilizing PAMPA cytoplasm (cms-P) in a restricted rye population, were studied in an enlarged population of 120 plants. A strong association with the trait was verified for 19 of the markers. The recombination of these markers was tested and two linkage groups were identified: one consisting of six and the other of eight AFLPs. The remaining markers were segregated as independent loci. Using wheat-rye addition and substitution lines, the AFLPs were assigned to individual rye chromosomes. AFLP profiles of such lines were generated to identify the DNA fragments co-migrating with individual markers. This identified 1R and 3R as the two chromosomes corresponding to the linkage groups of eight and six markers, respectively. Mapping in a DS2 x RXL10 population linked four additional AFLPs to chromosome arms IRS, 3RL, 4RL and 6RL. RAPD and SSR markers mapped in various populations and known to be located on the appropriate chromosomes did not disrupt the C394-F-2 population into sterile and fertile phenotypes. It was concluded that the identified markers would reduce by one half the number of primer pair combinations needed for molecular breeding programs or for the selection of parental forms for rye hybrid crosses.

AB We applied SSR markers for mapping genes determining red coleoptile colour in wheat (Rc1, Rc2, Rc3) using F-2 populations. All three genes map at about 15 to 20 cM distally from the centromere of chromosomes 7AS, 7BS and 7DS, respectively. The locations of the glume colour (Bg, Rg1) and glume hairiness (Hg) genes relative to the SSR markers of the homoeologous chromosomes group 1 were determined using molecular analysis of near-isogenic lines (NILs). One RAPD marker for the vernalisation response gene Vrn-A1 was identified by screening 95 random primers against two pairs of NILs. New PCR (STS) markers were developed based on RFLP-markers PSR426 (5A, 513, 5D) and PSR1201 (1A, 5A, 513). Analysis of nulli-tetrasomic and near-isogenic lines of wheat using the STS markers developed gave an indication that these new STS markers have the same chromosomal and intrachromosomal positions as the correspondent RFLP markers. Therefore, they could be used for mapping and/or tagging the vernalisation response (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1) and homoeologous pairing (Ph1) genes.

AB The wheat cultivars Siria and Alka were found to possess identical genes for resistance to Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici. Heterogeneity in leaf rust response was detected within the cultivar Alka, with most plants displaying the same disease response as cv. Siria. Cultivars Siria and Alka, as well as other European cultivars postulated to possess Lr10 and Lr13, showed a similar response patterns to several Australian and European pathotypes of P. recondita f. sp. tritici. The infection types were in most cases considerably lower in studies with European isolates of P. recondita f. sp. tritici than in the studies with Australian isolates. Although this is likely to be at least in part due to differences in the environmental conditions under which tests were conducted and to different interpretations of infection types, it was concluded that it was mainly due to differences in the pathogenicity of the isolates of P. recondila f. sp. tritici used. The presence of Lr10 in evs. Siria, Consort, Galahad, Hereward, Or-top, Tremie, Titlis, Encore, Rialto, Charger, Rapor, Shango, Danis, Pegaso as well as in Alka, was confirmed by a previously developed PCR-based STS marker based on Lrk10-6, a subfragment of a receptor-like kinase gene completely or tightly linked to Lr10. The confirmed presence of LHO in cv. Greif is consistent with findings described earlier by Schachermayr et al, (1997).

AB Two DNA markers, i.e., a fragment mixture (Thg-m) and a Thinopyrum intermedium-enriched moderate-repetitive sequence (Thg36) were obtained by microdissection of a pair of added chromosomes in a wheat-Th. intermedium disomic addition line (TAI-27), followed by direct cloning of the amplification product. The amplification product was produced by two sequential PCR amplifications: first by degenerate oligonucletide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) on the dissected chromosomes as a template; and second by sequence-specific PCR using primers designed according to highly conserved domains between two plant disease-resistance genes. Genomic Southern blot hybridization on relevant plant materials, including partial amphiploid, addition line, putative translocation line as well as parental lines, showed that the two DNA markers are useful in detecting A. intermedium chromatin introgressed into the wheat genome. Allocation of two low-copy sequences cloned from the same source to individual wheat chromosomes confirmed the origin of the microdissected target chromosome.

AB In low-input conditions of winter wheat growing it is an advantage to use genetically based resistance for protection against common bunt and dwarf bunt not only for economical reasons, but also with respect to the environment. Within 3 years of field testing of samples of Tilletia laevis and T tritici on the standard set of 14 winter wheat differential cultivars and lines (Bt0-Bt13) virulence of 20 European samples, one sample from the USA and one from Syria was established. In the studied set of bunt samples virulence to the wheat resistance genes Bt1, Bt2 and Bt7 and avirulence to genes Bt3, Bt5, Bt8, Bt9, Bt11, Bt12 and Bt13 most frequently occurred. The studied set represented mostly physiologic races designated as L5 or T5 (virulent to Bt1, Bt2, Bt7), followed by physiologic races L3 or T3 (virulent to Btl and Bt7). Among 19 cultivars tested in field experiments as potential sources of resistance, 17 cultivars were without infection, one cultivar had only 1.5% infected spikes, one cultivar had 13.5% infected spikes and the susceptible check 54.3%.

AB The development or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars that are resistant to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), yet competitive in yield under nondiscased conditions, is an objective for breeding programs in the Great Plains. This field study was conducted to compare classical and transgenic sources of resistance to WSMV. Three sets of germplasm were evaluated. These included adapted cultivars with various levels of tolerance, transgenic wheat lines containing viral coat protein or replicase sequences from WSMV that showed resistance in greenhouse trials, and germplasm with resistance to WSMV due to a translocated segment of chromosome 4Ai-2 from Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth and Dewey containing Wsm1. A replicated field trial was conducted at Bozeman, MT, over a two-year period to evaluate the effectiveness of these different sources of resistance to mechanical inoculation of WSMV. Adapted cultivars; differed in their ability to tolerate WSMV with mean reductions in yield over the two years ranging from 41 to 74%. Incorporation of the replicase or coat protein gene from WSMV did not provide field resistance to viral infection and in general, transgenic lines yielded less than their parent cultivar,'Hi- Line'. Wheat-Thinopyrum lines positive for a DNA marker linked to the Wsm1 gene had significantly reduced yield losses ranging from 5 to 39% compared with yield losses of 57 to 88% in near isogenic lines not having the Wsm1 gene. Yield of lines with Wsm1 in the absence of disease ranged from 11 to 28% less than yield of lines without Wsm1. Our results suggest Wsm1 provides the best source of WSMV resistance but a yield penalty may exist because or the presence of the translocation.

AB We searched for QTLs involved in tolerance to barley yellow dwarf (BYD), a serious viral disease of small grain cereals in two wheat populations, Opata x Synthetic (ITMI) and Frontana x INIA66 (F x I), for which marker data had previously been generated. The populations were evaluated in replicated field trials under artificial inoculation with a BYDV-PAV-Mex isolate and under disease-free conditions. Disease symptoms (yellowing, dwarfism and biomass reduction) were visually recorded and agronomic traits (number of tillers, height, biomass, yield and thousand-kernel weight) were measured on five plants per plot. Phenotypic data on all evaluated traits showed normal distribution with high correlation between visual estimates and measured values. Heritabilities were mostly moderate to high in the 114 lines of the ITMI population, and from low to moderate in the 117 lines of the F x I population. QTL analyses were based on genetic maps containing 443 loci for the ITMI population and 317 loci for the F x I population. Using composite interval mapping, 22 QTLs in the ITMI population and seven in the F x I population were detected, explaining 9.8-43.3% of total phenotypic variation (sigma(P)(2)) per agronomic trait in the first population, and 4.1-13.7% in the second. Individual QTLs explained less than 15.8% of sigma(P)(2). In the F x I population a minor QTL explaining 7% of sigma(P)(2) for yellowing was detected on the short arm of 7D, linked to leaf tip necrosis, a morphological marker for linked genes Bdv1, Yr18 and Lr34. A QTL consistently detected for several traits on 2D in the ITMI population and on the short arm of group 6 chromosome (6S) in F x I explained 10-15% of sigma(P)(2). The large number of QTLs having mostly small effects and the continuous distribution of all evaluated traits confirmed the polygenic nature and complexity of BYD tolerance in wheat.

AB Eighty-one different lines of Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schult., representative of its distribution area, were analysed. Homozygotic genotypes were obtained by at least two generations of self-pollination. The homogeneity of the progeny was tested by using nine seeds from three different plants. The LMW glutenin subunits were studied using the SDS-PAGE technique. The variability within the entire distribution area was analysed in a first step. After this, the variability was studied according to six geographic regions defined by climatic classifications. From both studies it is concluded that there is a huge variability in H. chilense for LMW-glutenins that could be useful in cereal breeding. Likewise, the variability found in this work was compared with the variability found for gliadins. It is concluded that degree of the variability for gliadins and LMW-glutenins is similar.

AB The use of model genetic systems in plant and animal studies has allowed a greatly increased understanding of how genomes regulate phenotype. Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) has proved to be an extremely useful model for plant molecular genetic studies and there are now many examples of important agricultural genes that have been identified using this species as a model. The discovery and investigation of a large number of arabidopsis mutants associated with seed development and germination indicates that resources are available, using comparative molecular genetics approaches, to identify candidate loci that may play important roles in the regulation and aetiology of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). Specific examples are discussed including the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) and FUSCA3 ( FUS3) loci, that encode proteins containing a highly conserved DNA binding domain originally identified in the maize Viviparous-1 ( Vp-1) transcription factor. The potential use of this gene family for the manipulation of PHS, either through marker-assisted breeding or transgenic approaches is discussed.

AB A series of experiments to investigate the genetic basis of pre-harvest sprouting are reported. The results are combined with previously published studies in a composite genetic map for sprout resistance in hexaploid wheat. Different studies, using classical genetics, aneuploids, chromosome substitutions, or QTL mapping, have identified various regions of the A, B, and D genomes affecting dormancy. Comparisons between the available studies lead to the following conclusions:
   Different studies often identify different genetic loci, in part reflecting different sampling from the available gene pool. This implies that many loci are involved in determining resistance, and that new loci may be discovered as the number of mapping studies increases. .There are, however, examples where similar map locations are implicated over different crosses. These may reflect the detection of key resistance genes. .Finally, (genotype x environment) interactions are frequently observed. The implications of these observations for crop improvement and research programmes are discussed.

AB Preharvest sprouting limits the consistent production of high quality wheat in many regions of the world. Improvements in tolerance from the introduction of better grain dormancy at, or near, harvest-ripeness would be expected to have a significant impact on the incidence and severity of sprouting. Genetic and molecular investigations have provided new evidence for the presence of dormancy genes on chromosome 3D of white-grained genotypes AUS1408 and N72.72 ( T. sphaerococcum derivative), and identified a potential molecular marker for one of the dormancy genes in AUS1408. Analysis of a doubled haploid population derived from Cranbrook (extremely non-dormant, very susceptible to sprouting) x Halberd (intermediate dormancy, moderately tolerant to preharvest sprouting) identified three significant quantitative trait loci on chromosome arms 2AL, 2DL, and 4AL, all contributed by the very susceptible parent.

AB An interspecific cross was made to transfer leaf rust and stripe rust resistance from an accession of Aegilops ovata (UUMM) to susceptible Triticum aestivum (AABBDD) cv. WL711. The F-1 was backcrossed to the recurrent wheat parent, and after two to three backcrosses and selfing, rust resistant progenies were selected. The C-banding study in a uniformly leaf rust and stripe rust resistant derivative showed a substitution of the 5M chromosome of Ae. ovata for 5D of wheat. Analysis of rust resistant derivatives with mapped wheat microsatellite makers confirmed the substitution of 5M for 5D. Some of these derivatives also possessed one or more of the three alien translocations involving 1BL, 2AL and 5BS wheat chromosomes which could not be detected through C-banding. A translocation involving 5DS of wheat and the substituted chromosome 5M of Ae. ovata was also observed in one of the derivatives. Susceptibility of this derivative to leaf rust showed that the leaf rust resistance gene(s) is/are located on short arm of 5M chromosome of Ae. ovata. Though the Ae. ovata segment translocated to 1BL and 2AL did not seem to possess any rust resistance gene, the alien segment translocated to 5BS may also possess gene(s) for rust resistance. The study demonstrated the usefulness of microsatellite markers in characterisation of interspecific derivatives.

AB Number of tillers per plant, plant growth habit in seedling and adult stages, and spike and spikelet characters are agronomically important features of the gross morphology of wheat. To localize to wheat chromosomes the genes for these traits, we scored them in a set of wheat recombinant-inbred mapping lines already well genotyped with molecular markers. Quantitative-trait analysis revealed a region near Gli-A2 ( Xpsr10) on the short arm of chromosome 6A strongly affecting tiller number and the correlated trait of seedling growth habit. Genes with opposing effects on adult plant type were localized on the short arms of chromosomes 2A and 3A, while genes affecting spike development were assigned to several A- and B-genome chromosomes. None of these genes showed synteny with counterpart QTLs reported to affect the same traits in rice. In the chromosome 2D region containing the photoperiod-insensitivity gene Ppd-D1, the major determinant of heading date in these autumn-sown lines, earliness alleles reduced tiller and spikelet numbers and increased erect seedling growth habit, but showed no influence on adult plant type or spike length. Though several of these morphological traits are generally considered to be associated with winter hardiness and their phenotypic intercorrelations were consistent with the genetic mapping evidence, no association was found between newly identified loci and known vernalization-response or frost-resistance loci.

AB Breeding for yellow stem borer resistance in rice is difficult owing to the complex genetics of the trait and inherent difficulties in screening. Identification of molecular markers linked to the trait would enhance phenotypic evaluation for the trait. An F-2 population was developed using parents contrasting in their reaction to yellow stem borer resistance. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, in conjunction with bulked segregant analysis, enabled us to identify four phenotype-specific RAPD markers. The markers C1(320) and K6(695) were linked with resistance and AH5(660) and C4(1300) with susceptibility. The markers K6(695) and AH5(660) were linked to the gene(s) at distances of 12.8 cM and 14.9 cM, respectively. Scoring of these markers in a set of germplasm confirmed their reproducibility and their association with the trait.

AB Powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the most important wheat diseases in many regions of the world. A powdery mildew resistance gene, originating from wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) accession 'C20', from Rosh Pinna, Israel, was successfully transferred to hexaploid wheat through crossing and backcrossing. Genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene controls the powdery mildew resistance at the seedling stage. Segregating BC1F2 progenies of the cross 87-1/C20//2*8866 were used for bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The PCR approach was used to generate polymorphic DNA fragments between the resistant and susceptible DNA pools by use of 10-mer random primers., STS primers, and wheat microsatellite primers. Three markers, Xgwm159/430, Xgwm159/460, and Xgwm159/500, were found to be linked to the resistance gene. After evaluating the polymorphic markers in two segregating populations, the distance between the markers and the mildew resistance gene was estimated to be 5-6 cM. By means of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomics and ditelosomics, the polymorphic markers and the resistance gene were assigned to chromosome arm 5BS and were physically mapped on the gene rich regions of fragment length (FL) 0.41-0.43 by Chinese Spring deletion lines. As no powdery mildew resistance gene has been reported on chromosome arm 5BS, the mildew resistance gene originating from C20 should be a new gene and is designated Pm30.

AB Chromosomal localization and linkage mapping of a powdery mildew resistance gene were conducted in the resistant wheat line Pova, derived from a Triticum aestivum cv. Poros-Aegilops ovata-alien addition line. Monosomic analysis revealed that a major dominant gene was located on chromosome 7D. This gene possessed a distinct disease response pattern against a differential set of Blumeria graminis tritici isolates and segregated independently from resistance gene Pm19 also located on wheat chromosome 7D. Molecular genetic analysis showed that the resistance gene in Pova was specifically located on the long arm of chromosome 7D closely linked to one RFLP and three AFLP markers. It is proposed that the new gene be designated Pm29.

AB The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) producing region of the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) is often subject to water deficits at sowing and during grain filling. Improved genetic adaptation of wheat cultivars to drought stress is one objective of breeding efforts in the region. Consequently, there is interest in identifying molecular markers associated with drought tolerance. Dehydrins, a family of proteins that accumulate in response to dehydrative stress, may provide a suitable marker for use in breeding programs. Seven cultivars (Connie, Gene, TAM105, Rod, Hiller, Rhode and Stephens) were evaluated in two experiments in which dehydrin accumulation and their association to stress tolerance during grain filling were characterized during progressive drought stress. A 24-kDa dehydrin was present in leaves at each sampling date in all seven cultivars. Quantitative differences in accumulation of this protein were observed between cultivars on the third sampling date (4 d of stress). This differential accumulation was associated with stress tolerance characterized by a lower yield reduction and a lowered rate of decrease in leaf water potential in Connie, TAM105 and Gene. In contrast to leaves, an increased number of dehydrins were observed in grains under stress and non-stress treatments. Despite the number of dehydrins detected, there was no apparent association between drought stress and dehydrin expression in grains. Although the specific role of these proteins remains unknown, their association with stress tolerance suggests that dehydrins have utility in improving adaptation to drought and as markers for drought tolerance.

AB Two sets of substitution lines were developed by crossing individual monosomic lines of Chinese Spring (recipient) with scab (Fusarium graminearum) resistant cultivar Sumai 3 (donor) and then using the monosomics as the recurrent male parent for four backcrosses (without selling after each backcross). The disomic substitution lines were separated from selfed BC4F2 plants. Chromosome specific SSR markers were analyzed for polymorphism between Sumai 3 and Chinese Spring. Polymorphic markers were used to identify substitution lines for specific chromosomes. Based on the specific SSR markers, chromosome substitutions occurred in thirty-six lines, and six lines segregated alleles from the two parents or were homozygous for the allele from Chinese Spring. These substitution lines were used to evaluate Type II (spread within the head) and Type V (deoxynivalenol accumulation within kernels) scab resistance. The objective was to use the substitution lines to evaluate the effect of individual chromosomes of Sumai 3 on Type II and Type V scab resistance in the greenhouse. Significant differences in Type II scab resistance and deoxynivalenol (DON) levels among different Chinese Spring (Sumai 3) substitution lines were detected. Positive chromosome substitution effects on Type II scab resistance were found on chromosomes 2B, 3B, 6B, and 7A from Sumai 3. Chromosomes 3B and 7A also reduced DON accumulation within the kernels, while chromosomes 1B, 2D, and 4D from Sumai 3 increased DON concentration. Chromosome 7A from Sumai 3 had the largest effect on resistance to scab spread and DON accumulation. Additional research is in progress on the scab resistance conferred by chromosome 7A.

Monosomic analyses employing the susceptible set of 21 Chinese Spring monosomic lines revealed that the line Jieyan 94-1-1 carries one dominant gene on translocated wheat/rye chromosome 1B/1R and one recessive gene on chromosome 7B, whereas line Siyan 94-1-2 possesses one recessive gene on chromosome 7B and one dominant gene on chromosome 5D. Allelism tests in combination with the use of specific isolates confirmed that the dominant genes in Jieyan 94-1-1 and Siyan 94-1-2 are Pm8 and Pm2, respectively. The recessive genes present in each of the two lines are shown to be new alleles located on chromosome 7B at the pm5 locus. The two genes are tentatively designated mljy in Jieyan 94-1-1 and mlsy in Siyan 94-1-2, respectively.

AB Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14, (EEb)-E-b = JJ) is recognized for its high tolerance to soil salinity and the scab disease caused by Fusarium graminearum. Seven Triticum aestivum/T. bessarabicum disomic addition lines (2n = 44 = 21 " ABD + 1 " E-b) developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center were assayed. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) showed that six of the seven were true disomic alien addition lines, whereas one was a duplication-translocation addition line in which four-fifths of the additional chromosome was an alien chromosome segment and one-fifth was a wheat chromosome segment. Using AFLP fragments amplified from 32 selective primer pairs, 389 fragments were assigned to T. bessarabicum chromosomes. The duplication-translocation addition line had no unique AFLP fragments but shared 25 fragments with the 7E(b) addition line, indicating that the translocation chromosome probably involved the 7E(b) rather than the 3E(b), as originally described. The presumed 6E(b) addition line was determined to have a pair of 4E(b) chromosomes. Thus, the 3E(b) and 6E(b) addition lines are missing. At present, there are 48 AFLP markers for 1E(b), 67 for 2E(b), 39 for 4E(b), 59 for 5E(b), and 54 for 7E(b). In addition, two RAPD markers for 1E(b), two for 2E(b), six for 4E(b), one for 5E(b), and three for 7E(b) were identified. Sixty-eight AFLP markers were present in the amphidiploid but absent in all tested disomic addition lines, making them putative markers for 3E(b) and/or 6E(b). Also, 50 AFLP and six RAPD markers occur in at least five E-b chromosomes. These molecular markers, when used in conjunction with GISH, will be useful in identifying the two missing E-b addition lines and in monitoring the introgression of E-b chromosomal segments into wheat.

AB Our objective was to develop a rapid and accurate procedure to genotype common bean plants for the bc-1(2) allele, which conditions resistance to bean common mosaic and bean common mosaic necrosis viruses. A segregating F-2 population was derived from the cross between pinto bean breeding lines P94207-43 (bc-1(2)//bc-1(2)) and P94207-189 (bc-1//bc-1). A quantitative PCR assay based on the detection of fluorescent labeled amplicons was developed to distinguish between homozygous (bc-1(2)//bc-1(2)), heterozygous (bc-1(2)//bc-1) and null (bc-1//bc-1) F-2 genotypes. Remnant F 1 plants were used as a comparative reference sample. PCR results among this sample fit a normal distribution, and 99% and 95% confidence intervals for heterozygotes were determined. F-2 plants for which no amplification was detected were classified as null (bc-1//bc-1) genotypes. F-2 plants that fell within the confidence intervals for heterozygotes were classified as heterozygotes (bc-1(2)//bc-1), while plants that fell outside the right tail of the heterozygote confidence intervals were classified as homozygotes (bc-1(2)//bc-1(2)). F-2 plants were also genotyped for the bc-1(2) allele by performing F 3 family progeny tests for virus resistance. Agreement between the two methods for genotyping plants was 100% (59/59) when PCR genotyping was based on a 99% heterozygote confidence interval, and 98.3% (58/59) when based on a 95% heterozygote confidence interval. This assay will accelerate breeding for virus resistance in bean by facilitating discrimination among plants that are heterozygous or homozygous for the bc-1(2) allele. The experimental design may be generally applicable towards developing other assays for the codominant interpretation of dominant markers in diploid plants.

AB Four different pearl millet breeding lines were transformed and led to the regeneration of fertile transgenic plants. Scutellar tissue was bombarded with two plasmids containing the bar selectable marker and the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (gus or uidA) under control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter or the maize Ubiquitin1 promoter (the CaMV 35S is not a maize promoter). For the delivery of the DNA-coated microprojectiles, either the particle gun PDS 1000/He or the particle inflow gun was used. The calli and regenerants were selected for their resistance to the herbicide Basta (glufosinate ammonium) mediated by the bar gene. Putative transformants were screened for enzyme activity by painting selected leaves or spraying whole plants with an aqueous solution of the herbicide Basta and by the histochemical GUS assay using cut leaf segments. PCR and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA indicated the presence of introduced foreign genes in the genomic DNA of the transformants. Five regenerated plants represent independent transformation events and have been grown to maturity and set seed. The integration of the bar selectable and the gus reporter gene was confirmed by genomic Southern blot analysis in all five plants. All five plants had multiple integrations of both marker genes. To date, the T 1 progeny of three out of four lines generated by the PDS particle gun shows co-segregating marker genes, indicating an integration of the bar and the gus gene at the same locus in the genome.

AB The growing availability of EST sequences from a range of crop plants provides a potentially valuable source of new DNA markers. We have examined the International Triticeae EST Cooperative database for the presence of dinucleotide and trinucleotide simple sequence repeats. Analysis of 24,344 ESTs identified 388 dinucleotide repeats and 978 trinucleotide repeats in ESTs, representing 1.6% and 4.0% of the total number of ESTs, respectively. To test the utility and cross-species transferability of EST-derived SSR markers, primers were designed to the flanking regions of 41 barley SSRs and used to screen 11 barley and 15 wheat varieties. Sixteen of the barley SSR markers were polymorphic in barley and five were polymorphic in wheat. This represents a relatively high level of transferability of SSR markers between barley and wheat, which has important implications for the development of new markers and comparative mapping of barley, wheat and other cereals. An additional 56 SSRs from wheat ESTs were tested in the same barley and wheat varieties. Four wheat EST SSR markers were polymorphic in wheat and one in barley. Chromosomal locations in barley and wheat were determined for the majority of polymorphic markers.

AB In order to efficiently complement traditional wheat breeding with genetic transformation technology it will be desirable to introduce transgenes into the ideal genetic background. Poor tissue culture performance is limiting the number of wheat genotypes that can be stably transformed. We statistically analysed the tissue culture response of 38 current European winter wheats and discuss genetic factors influencing this trait. Although regenerable callus cultures could be initiated from immature embryos of all 38 winter wheats analysed, the number of regenerated plants per cultured explant differed highly significantly (p<0.01) among genotypes. Ten cultivars with excellent ranking in this parameter were selected for transformation experiments. Independent transgenic plants were recovered from nine winter wheat genotypes with a frequency ranging between 0.2% and 2.0% of the cultured immature embryos after biolistic transfer of the bar gene and bialaphos selection. The nine transformable winter wheat genotypes included a recently released high-yielding, disease-resistant cultivar (cv. Certo), well established cultivars with elite bread-making quality (cv. Tarso, Alidos) and current breeding lines differing in yield, disease resistance and grain quality. Transgene integration and expression were confirmed by Southern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase activity assay and herbicide application. Transgene expression was stably transmitted to the sexual progeny of all transgenic lines analysed and segregated in a Mendelian fashion in the majority of lines. The introduction of transgenes into the ideal genetic background will allow a thorough evaluation of their crop improvement potential.

AB In many wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing areas, pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) may cause important damage, and in particular, it has deleterious effects on bread-making quality. The relationship between PHS and grain color is well known and could be due either to the pleiotropic effect of genes controlling red-testa pigrnentation (R) or to linkage between these genes and other genes affecting PHS. In the present work, we have studied a population of 194 recombinant inbred lines from the cross between two cultivars, 'Renan' and 'Recital', in order to detect QTLs for both PHS resistance and grain color. The variety 'Renan' has red kernels and is resistant to PHS, while 'Recital' has white grain and is highly susceptible to PHS. A molecular-marker linkage map of this cross was constructed using SSRs, RFLPs and AFLPs. The population was evaluated over 2 years at Clermont-Ferrand (France). PHS was evaluated on mature spikes under controlled conditions and red-grain color was measured using a chromameter. Over the 2 years, we detected four QTLs for PHS, all of them being co-localized with QTLs for grain color. Three of them were located on the long arm of chromosomes 3 A, 3B and 3D, close to the loci where the genes R and taVp1 were previously mapped. For these three QTLs, the resistance to PHS is due to the allele of the variety 'Renan'. Another co-located QTL for PHS and grain color was detected on the short arm of chromosome 5 A. The resistance for PHS for this QTL is due to the allele of 'Recital'.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB, scab) is a fungal disease of wheat and other small cereals that is found in both temperate and semi-tropical regions. FHB causes severe yield and quality losses, but the most-serious concern is the possible mycotoxin contamination of cereal food and feed. Breeding for FHB resistance by conventional selection is feasible, but tedious and expensive. This study was conducted to identify and map DNA markers associated with FHB resistance genes in wheat. A population of 364 F-1-derived doubled-haploid (DH) lines from the cross 'CM-82036' (resistant)/'Remus' (susceptible) was evaluated for Type II resistance (spread within the spike) during 2 years under field conditions. Marker analysis was performed on 239 randomly chosen DH lines. Different marker types were applied, with an emphasis on AFLP and SSR markers. Analysis of variance, as well as simple and composite interval mapping, were applied. Three genomic regions were found significantly associated with FHB resistance. The most-prominent effect was detected on the short arm of chromosome 3B, explaining up to 60% of the phenotypic variance for Type II FHB resistance. A further QTL was located on chromosome 5A and a third one on 1B. The QTL regions on 3B and 5A were tagged with flanking SSR markers, the 1B QTL was found associated with the high-molecular-weight glutenin locus. These results indicate that FHB resistance is under control of a few major QTLs operating together with unknown numbers of minor genes. Marker-assisted selection for these major QTLs involved in FHB resistance appears feasible and should accelerate the development or resistant and agronomically improved wheat cultivars.

AB The wheat - Thinopyrum intermedium addition lines Z1 and Z2 carry 21 pairs of wheat chromosomes and one pair of Th. intermedium chromosomes (2Ai-2) conferring resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). GISH results using the genomic DNA of Pseudoroegneria strigosa (S genome) as the probe indicated that the 2Ai-2 chromosome in Z1 and Z2 is an S-J intercalary translocation. Most of the 2Ai-2 chromosome belongs to the S genome, except for about one third in the middle region of the long arm that belongs to the J genome. The results of detailed RFLP analyses confirmed that the 2Ai-2 chromosome is extensively homoeologous to wheat group 2 chromosomes. Some new RFLP markers specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome were identified. A RAPD marker, OP-R16(340), specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome, was screened. We converted the RAPD marker into a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (designated SC-R16). The study establishes the basis for selecting translocation lines with small segments of the 2Ai-2 chromosome and localizing the BYDV resistance gene when introgressed into a wheat background.

AB Oryza malampuzhaensis Krish. et Chand. (2n = 4x = 48; Poaceae, Oryza) is endemic to Western Ghats, South India, and shows a highly localized distribution over a small geographical area in this region. This is the most poorly understood taxon in genus Oryza and is often misidentified as O. officinalis owing to their close morphology. We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations of O. malampuzhaensis using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation in O. malampuzhaensis. Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base in O. malampuzhaensis point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. Thus O. malampuzhaensis appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods. The present study also identified molecular markers diagnostic for O. malampuzhaensis.

AB Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum are the major pathogenic organisms causing head blight in small-grain cereals. Natural epidemics may result in severe yield losses, reduction in quality, and contamination of the grain by mycotoxins. The genetic diversity of four field populations of F. graminearum from Germany, Hungary, and Canada. and one population of F. culmorum from Russia was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based fingerprinting. Additionally, a world-wide collection and two of the F. graminearum populations were analysed for their aggressiveness on young plants of winter rye in the greenhouse. The number of isolates analysed per population varied from 25 to 70. Significant quantitative variation for aggressiveness was observed within each of the individual field populations amounting to the same range as the world-wide collection. Abundant variation within populations was also revealed by DNA markers. The F. graminearum populations from Hungary and Winnipeg displayed the least genotypic diversity, the two German F. graminearum populations and the Russian F. culmorum population were highly diverse. Population diversity., however, followed no spatial pattern among samples within a German field for aggressiveness or molecular markers. For F. graminearum, sexual recombination is the most likely explanation for the large genetic diversity within field populations. Asexual and/ or parasexual recombination, and balancing selection caused by the periodic alternation between the saprophytic and parasitic phase might play an additional role and account for the variation within the F. culmorum population. For improving Fusarium resistance, several resistance genes of different sources should be combined to avoid an unspecific adaptation of the genetically variable pathogen to an increased resistance level.

A wheat (Triticum aestivum) cDNA (WMn-SOD) was cloned and up-regulation of the transcript was observed in root tips after 24 h exposure to 100 muM Al. The WMnSOD1 under the control of the CaMV35S promoter was expressed in canola (Brassica napus). Transgenic plants were phenotypically normal. Northern analyses showed enhanced levels of the WMnSOD1 and WMnSOD1-GUS transcripts and total SOD activity was 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater in transgenic plants than in wild type (WT) plants. Transgenic (T-1) leaf discs showed increased retention of chlorophyll and reduced electrolyte leakage when exposed to methyl viologen (MV) as compared with WT leaf discs, suggesting that transgenic plants were more resistant to oxidative stress. When WT canola plants were exposed to aluminium (0-200 muM), inhibition of root growth, higher SOD activity and increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation) were observed in roots. Aluminium-induced inhibition of root growth and accumulation of MDA was lower in homozygous transgenic plants (T-2) compared with WT plants. Transgenic lines also showed lower synthesis of 1,3-beta -glucans (callose, a sensitive marker for Al injury) as compared with WT. These data suggest that resistance to Al toxicity can be improved by overexpressing WMhSOD1.

AB Surveys of crop pathogen virulence use testing methods based on host-pathogen interactions. The virulence of pathogen isolates is characterized by inoculating each isolate onto a set of differential varieties possessing known resistance genes. This approach is slow and imposes severe limitations on [he number of samples that can be tested and hence on the efficiency of the survey. One possible way to achieve more rapid screening of isolates might be by the use of molecular markers in the pathogen that are closely linked to each virulence factor, AFLP was used to investigate genetic variation between isolates of wheat yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) differing in virulence for [he host resistance gene Yr17, Ten pathogen isolates were screened against 62 different primer combinations, of which 23 gave one or more polymorphisms. Each isolate was uniquely identified by its AFLP polymorphisms, but no individual AFLP marker was consistently associated with virulence for Yr17. Whilst the AFLP technique is proving valuable as a tool to compare the overall genetic relatedness of yellow rust isolates, further work is needed to identify specific markers that can be developed as a rapid virulence screen for use in pathogen surveys.

AB Diplosporous apomeiosis, formation of unreduced embryo sacs primarily of the Antennaria type, followed by parthenogenetic embryo development and pseudogamy (fertilization of the central cell) describe gametophytic apomixis within the Tripsacum agamic complex. Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass) is a close relative of domesticated maize and was chosen as a natural model system to investigate gene expression patterns associated with parthenogenesis. The genome size of diploid sexual and polyploid apomictic T. dactyloides was estimated by flow cytometry to be 7.37 pg (2C), 14.74 pg (4C) and 22.39 pg (6C), respectively. The diploid genome size is thus approximately 1.35x larger than that of maize. The apomeiotic-pseudogamous pathway of seed formation was demonstrated at a rate of 92% by the flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS) with single mature seeds in tetraploid accessions. This number includes twin embryos which were detected in 13% of the seeds analyzed. Fertilization of unreduced egg cells (B-III hybrids) was measured in 10% of apomictic seeds. Autonomous (fertilization-independent) embryo development and fertilization-dependent endosperm formation were confirmed by pollination of tetraploid T. dactyloides with a diploid transgenic maize line carrying an actin::beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter construct. GUS expression was detected after pollination in the developing endosperm, but not in the embryo. In similar intraspecific crossing experiments with maize, GUS expression was detected in both the embryo and endosperm. A protocol was established fur microdissection of embryo sacs and early parthenogenetic embryos of T. dactyloides. Together, these techniques provide new tools for future studies aimed at comparing gene expression patterns between sexual maize and sexual or apomictic T dactyloides.

AB Our previous study has shown that prothyrotropin-releasing hormone (proTRH) gene expression is increased in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons following precipitated morphine withdrawal and continues to be activated even 24 h after withdrawal. We have hypothesized that peptide products of proTRH may participate in the recovery from morphine withdrawal. To identify neuroanatomical substrates of the proposed action of proTRH-derived peptides originating from the ventrolateral PAG proTRH neurons, projections of these neurons were investigated by a series of anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing experiments. First, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) was injected in the ventrolateral PAG in Sprague-Dawley rats. Following transport of the tracer, simultaneous immunolabeling for PHA-L and proTRH peptides was performed and mapped in discrete brain regions. PHA-L-immunoreactive (IR) fibers showing preterminal and terminal-like arborization that contained proTRH were identified in the dorsolateral and lateral PAG, deep layer of superior colliculus (CS), parafascicular nucleus (PF), ventromedial zona incerta (ZI) and at the border of the locus coeruleus (LC) and Barrington's nucleus. Scattered double-labeled fibers were present in the lateral septal nucleus, ventromedial preoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, perifornical area and in the periventricular region at the diencephalon/midbrain junction. The retrogradely transported marker, cholera toxin beta -subunit (CTb) was then injected in the dorsolateral PAG, CS, PF, ZI and medial to the LC. Double-labeled perikarya for both CTb and proTRH in the ventrolateral PAG were found for each region injected with CTb, corroborating the findings by the anterograde tracing experiment. These studies demonstrate that proTRH neurons in the ventrolateral PAG project to several regions of the brain that are involved in autonomic and behavioral regulation and thereby, may function as an integrating center to coordinate responses to opiate withdrawal.

AB Background: Quantifying plant gene expression by flow cytometry (FCM) would allow multidimensional cell-parameter analysis on a per-cell basis, thereby providing insight into the cellular mechanisms of plant gene regulation. Here we sought to establish quantitation by FCM of plant hormone (abscisic acid, ABA)-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and to compare the method directly with traditional reporter enzyme assays.
   Materials and Methods: GFP, beta -glucuronidase, and luciferase reporter genes driven by ABA-inducible or constitutive promoter constructs were expressed in transiently cotransformed rice protoplasts and reporter activities quantified by FCM (for GFP) or traditional enzyme assays. Treatments included cotransformations with specific ABA signaling effector cDNA constructs (encoding VIVIPAROUS-1, an ABA transcription factor, and ABA-INSENSITIVE1-1, a dominant-negative protein phosphatase regulator) and the ABA agonist lanthanum. chloride. Dual-color FCM was also performed on GFP-expressing cells immunodecorated with an mAb recognizing a rice cell surface epitope.
   Results: Quantitative analysis of ABA-inducible gene expression by FCM using GFP as reporter gave comparable results to traditional reporter enzyme assays, although the signal-to-noise ratio wits less for FCM, which can be a limitation of the method at low promoter strengths. Multiparameter-correlated analysis of ABA-inducible GFP expression with a plasma membrane marker showed no apparent correlation between ABA sensitivity, marked by GFP, and presence of a cell surface arabinogalactan glycoprotein.
   Conclusions: Quantitative FCM of GFP-cxpressing plant cells is a rapid, robust, reproducible, and value-added method relative to traditional enzymatic reporter gene assays. Cytometry 45:170-179, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The promoter region of the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) gene was found to be polymorphic between japonica (T309) and indica (IR24) lines as the result of a 270-bp deletion in T309. A TTATA footprint in the T309 rubq2 promoter suggested that an excision event had occurred, and inspection of the 270-bp region present in IR24 revealed that it had all the characteristics of a miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE). Database searches showed that this element is a member of a new MITE family. which we have named Kiddo. Thirty-five complete Kiddo sequences were identified in existing rice genomic sequence databases. They could be arranged into four groups, within-group sequence identity was over 90%, with 65-75% identity between groups. The high sequence similarity within a group indicates that some Kiddo members were recently mobile and may still be active. An additional 24 decayed Kiddo sequences were detected. Interestingly, similar to 80% of 18 Kiddo members from annotated accessions lie within 530 bp of a coding sequence. That similar to 40% of Kiddo members present in genic regions reside in introns suggests that Kiddo transposition entails the use of both DNA and RNA intermediates, and may provide some insight into the origins of individual groups. DNA blot analysis showed that Kiddo is a rice-specific element, although one sequence with limited (72%) similarity to Kiddo group A was detected as a wheat EST. Kiddo family members may represent new molecular and phylogenetic markers, as well as representing valuable materials for studying the molecular mechanisms of MITE transposition.

AB A chimaeric gene was constructed comprising a wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit gene promoter, a 304-bp sucrose non-fermenting-1-related (SnRK1) protein kinase sequence in the antisense orientation, and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA gene terminator. Transgenic barley plants containing the antisense SnRK1 chimaeric gene were produced by particle bombardment of barley immature embryos with the aim of obtaining plants expressing the antisense SnRK1 sequence in the seeds. Despite the fact that the promoter was expected to be active only in seeds, two independent transgenic lines were found to fail to transmit the transgene to the T-1 generation. These T-0 plants had matured and died before this was discovered, but subsequently four other independent transgenic lines were found to be affected in the same way. Cytological analysis of the pollen grains in these lines showed that about 50% were normal but the rest had arrested at the binucleate stage of development, were small, pear-shaped, contained little or no starch and were non-functional. The presence of antisense SnRK1 transcripts was detected in the anthers of the four lines analyzed and a ubiquitin promoter/UidA (Gus) gene, one of the marker genes codelivered with the antisense gene, was found to be expressed only in the abnormal pollen. Expression analyses confirmed that SnRK1 is expressed in barley anthers and that expression of one class of SnRK1 transcripts (SnRK1b) was reduced in the abnormal lines. All of the abnormal lines showed approximately 50% seed set, and none of the transgenes were detected in the T-1 generation.

AB Chromosomal mutations in barley (Hordeum vulgare, 2n=2x=14, HH) chromosome 7H added to the common wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n=6x=42, AABBDD) cultivar Chinese Spring were induced genetically by the gametocidal activity of certain alien chromosomes derived from wild species of the genus Aegilops. The rearranged barley chromosomes were characterized by C-banding, FISH and GISH. Twenty two deletion or translocation chromosomes in a hemizygous condition were selected for deletion mapping of 17 AFLP and 28 STS markers that are specific to 7H. Of the 22 breakpoints in chromosome 7H, seven involved the short arm (7HS), 12 the long arm (7HL) and three were in the centromeric region, The seven 7HS breakpoints separated all four 7HS-specific AFLP markers and split the 21 STS markers into six groups. One breakpoint occurred between two STS markers formerly occupying the same position in the genetic map. All seven 7HS breakpoints were separated from each other by either the AFLP or STS markers. The 12 breakpoints in 7HL divided the 13 7HL-specific AFLP markers into seven groups, and the seven STS markers into three groups. On the other hand, the 12 breakpoints in 7HL were divided into six groups by the AFLP markers and into two groups by the STS markers. This deletion-based map was in accordance with previously published genetic and physical maps using the same STS markers. The breakpoints, AFLP markers and STS markers were arrayed in a consistent order.

AB This paper describes the first extensive genetic map of Hordeum bulbosum, the closest wild relative of cultivated barley. H. bulbosum is valuable for haploid production in barley breeding, and because of desirable agronomic characteristics, it also has potential for trait introgression into barley. A H. bulbosum map will assist introgression and provide a basis for the identification of QTLs for crossability with barley and other potentially useful genes. The present study used a population of 111 individuals from a PB1 xPB 11 cross to develop a genetic linkage map of diploid H. bulbosum (2n=2x=14) based on barley, wheat and other "anchor" cereal RFLP markers previously mapped in other species. Because of the cross-pollinating and highly polymorphic nature of H. bulbosum, up to four alleles showed segregation at any one locus, and five different segregation types were found. This enabled maps to be developed for the PB1 and PB11 parents, as well as a combined map. In total, 136 RFLP loci were mapped with a marker coverage of 621 cM. The markers were generally colinear with barley but H. bulbosum had less recombination in the centromeric regions and similar or more in the distal regions. Cytological studies on pollen mother cells at metaphase-I showed marked distal localization of chiasmata and a frequency consistent with the genetic map length. This study showed that H. bulbosum was highly polymorphic, making it suitable for trait analysis and supplementing maps of barley.

Bulked segregant analysis was performed on progeny of a cross between Duokang #1 and the gall midge-susceptible cultivar Feng Yin Zhan using the RAPD method. The RAPD marker OPM06((1400)) amplified a locus linked to Gm-6(t). The locus was subsequently mapped to rice chromosome 4 in a region flanked by cloned RFLP markers RG214 and RG163. Fine mapping of Gm-6(t) revealed that markers RG214 and RG476 flanked the gene at distances of LO and 2.3 cM, respectively. Another gall midge resistance gene, Gm-2, mapped previously to chromosome 4. is located about 16 cM from Gm-6(t). to judge by data from a segregating population derived from a cross between Duokang #1 and the Indian cultivar Phalguna that carries Gm-2. We developed a PCR-based marker-assisted selection kit for transfer of the Gm-6(t) gene into Ming Hui 63 and IR50404, two parental lines commonly used in hybrid rice production in China. The kit contains PCR primer pairs based on the terminal sequences of the RG214 and RG476 clones. Polymorphism between Duokang #1 and the hybrid parental lines was found at these markers after digestion of the PCR products with specific restriction endonucleases. The kit will accelerate introduction of gall midge resistance into hybrid rice in China.

AB In wheat it is essential to know whether a gene is located in a high or low recombination region of the genome before initiating a map-based cloning approach. The objective of this study was to explore the potential feasibility of map-based cloning of the dominant male-sterile gene Ms3 of wheat. High-density physical maps of the short arms of the group-5 chromosomes (5AS, 5BS, and 5DS) of Triticum aestivum L. were constructed by mapping 40 DNA markers on a set of 17 homozygous deletion lines. One hundred RFLP loci were mapped: 35 on 5AS, 37 on 5BS, and 28 on 5DS. A consensus physical map was colinearly aligned with a consensus genetic map of the group-5 short arms. Sixteen of the 17 markers in the consensus genetic map encompass a genetic distance of 25 cM and correspond to the distal region (FL 0.56-0.97) of the consensus physical map. Two rice probes, RG463 and RG901, previously identified to be linked to markers CDO344 and CD0749 (group-5 short arm of wheat), respectively, in the genetic map of rice chromosome 12, map between FL 0.56 and 0.63 in the consensus map. Thus at least a part of the group-5 short arm is homoeologous to a region of chromosome 12 of rice. The genetic map of chromosome arrn 5AS was constructed using a population of 139 BC, plants derived from a cross between the euploid wheat "Chris" carrying a dominant male-sterile gene Ms3 and a disomic substitution line in which chromosome 5A of T aestivum cv Chinese Spring was substituted by chromosome 5A from Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides. The map has a genetic length of 53.4 cM with 11 DNA markers. The initial map showed that the gene Ms3 cosegregated with three markers, WG341, BCD1130 and CD0677. High-resolution mapping using an additional 509 BC, plants indicated that the marker WG341 was closely linked to Ms3 at a genetic distance of 0.8 cM. The Ms3 was mapped physically in the region spanning 40% of the arm length from the centromere of 5AS. Therefore, mapbased cloning of the Ms3 is not feasible, although WG341 can be used as a useful tag for the Ms3 gene for breeding purposes.

AB Leaf rust is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide, particularly in the Great Plains region of the USA. One long-term strategy for the control of this disease may be through durable genetic resistance by gene pyramiding. An important step in this strategy is identifying molecular markers linked to different leaf rust-resistance genes. Here we report the molecular tagging of a leaf rust-resistance gene that may have the potential for durable resistance through further genetic manipulation and gene pyramiding. Lr39 was previously designated for a leaf rust-resistance gene introgressed from Aegilops tauschii accession TA1675 into the common wheat germplasm WGRC2. Lr40 was designated for a gene derived from Ae. tauschii accession TA1649 and is present in germplasm WGRC7. These genes are now believed to be allelic to Lr21, which was transferred to wheat from a different accession of Ae. tauschii. Molecular mapping of Lr39 and Lr40 indicates that both genes come from TA1649. WGRC2 and WRGC7 also have a similar infection type against rust culture PRTUS6. We suggest the designation of the gene in WGRC2 should be changed to Lr40. RFLP marker KSUD14 (locus Xksud14) was found 0.2-cM proximal to Lr40 in a WGRC2/Wichita F-2 population (218 individuals), and co-segregated with the gene in a WGRC7/Wichita F-2 population (165 individuals). A PCR-based molecular marker developed from the sequence-tagged-site (STS) of XksudI4 was mapped to the same locus as the RFLP marker KSUD14 in both populations. KSUD14 has the structure of a resistance gene analog (RGA) including kinase2a and kinase3 domains similar to the Cre3 gene of wheat and the rust resistance gene Rpl-D of maize. When the PCR products amplified from KSU14 STS were cleaved with restriction enzyme MspI, an 885-bp fragment was found in WGRC2, WGRC7, the Lr21 near-isogenic line, and eight accessions of Ae. tauschii shown to have resistance gene alleles at the Lr21 locus. The KSUD14 PCR-based assay provides an excellent marker for Lr40 and Lr21 in diverse wheat breeding and wild Ae. tauschii populations.

AB One hundred and forty six barley doubled-haploid lines (DH lines) were tested for variation in grain yield, yield components, plant height, and heading date after artificial infection with a German isolate of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV-Braunschweig). Of these 146 lines 76 were derived from the cross of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) tolerant cultivar 'Post' to cv 'Vixen' (Ryd2) and 70 from the cross of Post to ev 'Nixe. Phenotypic measurements were gathered on both non-infected plants and plants artificially inoculated with BYDV-PAV by viruliferous aphids in pot and field experiments for three years at two locations. For all traits a continuous variation was observed suggesting a quantitative mode of inheritance for tolerance against BYDV-PAV. Using skeleton maps constructed using SSRs, AFLPs and RAPDs, two QTLs for relative grain yield per plant after BYDV infection, explaining about 47% of the phenotypic variance, were identified in Post x Vixen at the telomeric region of chromosome 2HL and at a region containing the Ryd2 gene on chromosome 3HL. In Post x Nixe, a QTL was found in exactly the same chromosome 2HL marker interval. In this cross, additional QTL were mapped on chromosomes 7H and 4H and together these explained about 40% of the phenotypic variance. QTL for effects of BYDV infection on yield components, plant height, and heading date generally mapped to the same marker intervals, or in the vicinity of the QTL for relative grain yield. on chromosomes 2HL and 3HL, suggesting that these regions are of special importance for tolerance to the Braunschweig isolate of BYDV-PAV. Possible applications of marker-assisted selection for BYDV tolerance based on these results are discussed.

AB Grain protein concentration (GPC) of hexaploid wheat is one of the important factors that determines the end-product quality, as well as playing a pivotal role in human nutrition. In an attempt to identify PCR-based DIVA markers linked to GPC, 106 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from a cross between two wheat cultivars PH132 and WL711, which differ significantly in GPC, by the single seed descent method. The RILs were phenotyped for GPC at two diverse agroclimatic locations, namely Pune and Ludhiana, to study the influence of genotype and environment interactions on this trait. The parents were screened with 85 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers and 350 random primers. The selective genotyping and whole population analysis revealed nine DIVA markers associated with the trait. Three markers (UBC844(1100), UBC880(1100), and OPA4(800)) were observed to be associated with the trait in both locations, whereas two markers (OPH4(1400) and UBC873(750)) were found to be specific to Pune, and four markers (OPM5(870), OPO10(870), OPV14(1200), and UBC825(1000)) were specific to Ludhiana. Together five markers at the Pune location representing five QTLs and seven markers at Ludhiana representing four QTLs accounted,for 13.4 and 13.5% of total phenotypic variation, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that GPC is highly influenced by the environment, and the applicability of ISSR and RAPD markers in finding regions on chromosomes associated with quantitative characters in wheat such as GPC.

AB Seventy three accessions of the seven Vicia species belonging to Sativa species complex were screened for nuclear and organellar restriction fragment length polymorphic (RFLP), and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Total genomic DNAs of 73 accessions was restricted with three enzymes, and the restriction fragments were hybridized to the wheat rDNA probe pTa71 (containing 18S, 5.8S and 25S rDNA genes, and spacers), and faba bean probes Ver 6-5 (entire intergenic spacer flanked by small part of 25S and 18S fragments) and Ver 18-6 (part of the coding region of the gene and internal transcribed spacers). In XbaI digests, 16 repeat unit length classes in 24 combinations were identified. Digestion with EcoRI and DraI gave 2-4 and 1-3 fragments, respectively, with detectable hybridization to the probes, indicating the existence of internal XbaI sites. All the accessions produced 3.5 kb EcoRI fragment arising from coding region of the repeat unit. Four hundred and eighteen RAPD markers among 45 accessions were identified with 14 arbitrary 10-base primers. The percentage of polymorphic bands within species ranged from 20 in V. angustifolia to 98% in V. nigra. Both RFLP and RAPD markers were unable to assess the relationships between accessions within species as there was often much closer resemblances between certain accessions of different species rather than between accessions within each taxon. This analysis supports the view based on morphological, cytogenetical and crossability data that it is not possible to classify Sativa species complex into a small finite number of taxa which are clearly circumscribed, and that the complex represents a unique case of rapid evolution and incipient speciation. A study of chloroplast and mitochondrial RFLPs was undertaken to analyze phylogeny through maternal lineage. Chloroplast DNA restriction fragment patterns, using 13 restriction endonucleases, revealed 92.6 to 99% homology between the seven species. Twelve enzyme-probe combinations yielded identical fragment patterns for all the seven species. The molecular sizes of the chloroplast DNAs obtained were similar (121.5-123.5 kb), indicating that they had all lost one of the inverted repeats. Total DNAs digested with three restriction enzymes and hybridized to six heterologous probes of mitochondrial origin yielded monomorphic bands in five enzyme-probe combinations across all the 73 accessions. In other combinations as well, 40-66 accessions yielded monomorphic profiles. The small variation in the remaining accessions was not species-specific since the same profiles were present in more than one species. These results i) strongly suggest that the seven species within the complex share a common ancestor, or direct lineage and, ii) indicate that these species should be relegated to a rank, perhaps of subspecies, within V sativa species complex.

AB The long arm of chromosome 4D in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been shown in previous studies to harbor genes of agronomic importance. A major dominant gene conferring Aluminum (Al) tolerance (Alt2 in 'Chinese Spring' and Alt(BH) in 'BH 1146'), and the Kna1 locus controlling the K+/Na+ discrimination in saline environments have been mapped to this chromosome arm. However, accurate information on the genetic and physical location of markers related to any of these genes is not available and would be useful for map-based cloning and marker-assisted plant breeding. In the present study, using a population of 91 recombinant inbred lines segregating for Al tolerance, we provide a more extensive genetic linkage map of the chromosome arm 4DL based on RFLP, SSR, and AFLP markers, delimiting the Alt(BH) gene to a 5.9-cM interval between markers Xgdm125 and Xpsr914. In addition, utilizing a set of wheat deletion lines for chromosome arm 4DL, the Alt(BH) gene was physically mapped to the distal region of the chromosome, between deletion breakpoints 0.70 and 0.86, where the kilobase/centimorgan ratio is assumed to be low, making the map-based cloning of the gene a more realistic goal. The polymorphism rates in chromosome arm 4DL for the different types of markers used were extremely low, as confirmed by the physical mapping of AFLPs. Finally, analysis of 1 Mb of contiguous sequence of Arabidopsis chromosome 5 flanking the gene homologous to the BCD1230 clone (a cosegregating marker in our population coding for a ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase gene), revealed a previously identified region of stress-related and disease-resistance genes. This could explain the collinearity observed in comparative mapping studies among different species and the low level of polymorphism detected in the chromosome arm 4DL in hexaploid wheat.

AB We describe the genomic DNA diversity and divergence of the cyanobacterium Nostoc linckia from "Evolution Canyon," a microsite consisting of ecologically contrasting slopes, south-facing slope (SFS) and north-facing slope (NFS), at lower Nahal Oren, Mt. Carmel, Israel. The opposing slopes share their limestone lithology, but vary greatly in their ecology, primarily because of different levels of solar radiation (which is six times higher on the SFS than on the NFS). The warm and xeric SFS displays a tropical African savanna, whereas the cool and mesic NFS displays a temperate South European Mediterranean live-oak maquis shrub forest. The cyanobacterium Nostoc linckia tested here is a sessile microorganism, growing as a carpet on rock surfaces and constantly exposed to environmental fluctuations of solar radiation, temperature, and desiccation. We demonstrate remarkable interslope and intraslope genetic divergence of the genome (including both coding and noncoding regions) of Nostoc linckia, by using 211 AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) DNA molecular marker loci. Genetic polymorphism of N. linckia subpopulations on the ecologically harsher SFS was significantly (p < 0.05) higher (P = 99.53%) than was that of the subpopulations on the climatically milder NFS (P = 85.78%). Genetic polymorphism (P) and gene diversity (He) were significantly correlated with variables influencing aridity stress: solar radiation (Sr) (r(p) = 0.956; p = 0.046), temperature (Tm) (r(p) = 0.993; p = 0.0068), and day-night temperature difference (Tdd) (r(p) = 0.975; p = 0.025). As in other tested organisms from "Evolution Canyon", but even more exceptionally because of its completely sedentary nature, we suggest that the climatically stressed SFS environment is responsible for this marked increase of genetic polymorphism, which is maintained by the combined evolutionary forces of diversifying and balancing selection. This could highlight the importance of ecological stress and selection in evolution and its remarkable effect on the genetic system across the prokaryotic genome.

AB Microsatellite markers have many of the properties of an ideal marker, but development of microsatellite markers is tedious, time-consuming and expensive. In the past few years, great efforts have been made to develop, map and utilize microsatellite markers in various crops. It is still a major challenge to find a microsatellite marker associated with an economically important trait. In the present study we report on the targeted development of a microsatellite marker to a barley disease resistance gene. The method includes the following steps: (1) pooling DNA samples from a segregating population based on the principle of bulked-segregant analysis; (2) digesting the pooled DNAs and ligating adaptors; (3) selectively amplifying and identifying polymorphic microsatellites; and (4) developing primers for the microsatellite associated with the targeted trait. Using this method, a microsatellite marker associated with the true loose smut resistance gene (Un8) in the Harrington x TR306 doubled-haploid population was identified. This marker showed polymorphism in four breeding populations segregating for true loose smut resistance. In three of these populations, genetic distance between the microsatellite and the true loose smut resistance gene varied from 8.6 to 10.3 cM. Polymorphism of the microsatellite was tested among three disease resistant lines and 21 susceptible cultivars. Fourteen to eighteen of the 21 susceptible cultivars exhibited a polymorphism for the microsatellite with respect to at least one of the disease-resistant lines. This method for the targeted development of microsatellite markers should have widespread applicability and should efficiently provide highly polymorphic markers for use in breeding programs.

AB The doubled haploid (DH) wheat line 'dh 5841' carrying two translocations from rye, 5DL.5RS and 1BL.1RS. has been crossed to the subline of wheat cultivar 'Amadeus 7143' with a 1BL.1RS translocation. The resulting F, hybrid IJ 98 with a heterozygous 5DL.5DS-5DL.5RS chromosome pair has been used to produce doubled haploids. A total of 57 DH lines were obtained from plantlets regenerated in anther culture after successful colchicine treatment and seed set. These lines were identified regarding the constitution of chromosome 5D (5DL.5DS or 5DL.5RS) by means of isoenzyme marker analysis. Thirty DH lines possessed the 5DL.5DS chromosome, while the remaining 27 lines carried the 5DL.5RS translocation. For some of these lines, the 5DL.5RS chromosome was cytologically confirmed by C-banding. Furthermore, the DH lines were evaluated for their high molecular weight glutenin subunit composition. All possible combinations for the four independent loci - Skdh, Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 - were detected in only 57 DH lines and no segregation distortion was observed.

AB A sequence-tagged site marker has been developed from restriction fragment length polymorphism marker probe IAG95 for the rye-derived powdery mildew resistance Pm8/Pm17 locus of common wheat. This polymerase chain reaction marker enables the amplification of DNA fragments with different sizes from T1AL.1RS and T1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation cultivars with chromatin from 'Insave' and 'Petkus' rye, respectively, and therefore will be very useful in distinguishing Pm8-carrying cultivars from Pm17-carrying cultivars. Results obtained with that marker were compared with resistance tests performed on detached primary leaves of 29 wheat lines from two populations derived from doubled haploid production. The molecular assay corresponded well with the resistance tests in all the lines, and therefore will be helpful for the identification of Pm17 in lines in which other Pin genes or quantitative trait loci are present.

AB An efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure for barley was developed for immature embryos. Factors considered crucial for the delivery and integration of transgenes, such as type of growth regulator, duration of preculture period, plasmolysis and micro wounding were evaluated for their effect on frequencies of transient expression and stable integration. Dicamba in the callus induction and maintenance media was generally superior to 2,4-D in promoting transient expression and subsequent stable transformation. Plasmolysis generally reduced the level of transient expression although transgenic plants were recovered when 1-day precultured embryos were plasmolysed and grown on 2,4-D containing media. Micro wounding by particle bombardment did not change the level or localisation of transient expression events after Agrobacterium infection. Transgenic plants were generated with five out of 12 different procedures with transformation efficiencies ranging from 1.7 to 6.3%. Integration of bar and uidA coding sequences was confirmed by PCR for 75 plants representing 42 independent transgenic lines. Expression of the uidA gene was detected in 74% of primary transformants while 91% of them expressed the bar gene. Southern analysis proved integration of the transgenes with copy numbers ranging from one to six. Most transgenic lines that expressed both marker and reporter genes showed simple integration patterns and Mendelian inheritance of the transgenes in TI progeny.

AB The visco-elastic properties of bread flour are firmly associated with the presence or absence of certain HMW subunits coded by the Glu-1 genes. Identifying allelic specific molecular markers (AS-PCR) associated with the presence of Glu-1 genes can serve as a valuable tool for the selection of useful genotypes. This paper reports the use of primers designed from nucleotide sequences of the Glu-D1 gene of wheat (AS-PCR for Glu-D1y10) that recognise and amplify homologous sequences of the Glu-R1 gene subunits of rye. The primers amplify the complete coding regions and provided two products of different size in rye, in wheats carrying the substitution 1R(1D) and in rye-wheat aneuploid lines carrying the long arm of chromosome IR. The location, the molecular characterisation of these sequences and their expression during grain ripening seem to demonstrate that the amplification products correspond to structural genes encoding the high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenins of rye. The homology of the rye gene to subunits encoding HMW glutenins in wheat was confirmed by Southern blots and sequencing. The amplification-products were cloned, sequenced and characterised, and the sequences compared with the main glutenin subunits of wheat and related species. Further, an RT-PCR experiment was performed using primers designed from the sequence of both amplified products. This assay demonstrated that both sequences are expressed in endosperm. during grain ripening. The results of these analyses suggest that both gene subunits correspond to x- and y-type genes of the Glu-R1 locus of rye.

AB A wild barley, Hordeum vulgare L. ssp. spontaneum (C. Koch.) Thell. (syn. H. spontaneum C. Koch.) is considered to be the progenitor of cultivated barley (H. vulgare L. ssp. vulgare). A complete set of Triticum aestivum L. cv. 'Shinchunaga'-H. spontaneum OUH602 whole chromosome addition lines, and 5 telosomic addition lines were developed. Chromosome constitutions of the addition lines were confirmed by C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization. Addition lines for the entire IR chromosome and its long arm are only available as monosomic and monotelosomic additions, respectively, because of sterility. All other lines were recovered as disomic or ditelosomic additions. Self-sterile monosomic III and monotelosomic 1HL addition lines can be reproduced by backcrossing the plants having simultaneous addition of the long arm of barley chromosome 6H, because the plants with such chromosome constitutions recover partial female fertility. In general, the phenotypic alternations observed in each of the wheat-H. spontaneum OUH602 addition lines were similar to those previously noted in the corresponding lines of the 'Chinese Spring' wheat-'Betzes' barley addition series and the primary trisomic series of the H. spontaneum accession OUH602. Monotelosomic 1HL addition and ditelosomic IHS addition are especially valuable for unequivocal chromosome arm localization of barley genes and markers clustered around the centromeric region of 1H. The utility of the wheat-H. spontaneum addition lines is discussed.

AB Oryza malampuzhaensis Krish. et Chand., one of the tetraploid taxa in the genus Oryza (Poaceae), is geographically restricted to Western Ghats, southern India. This is one of the poorly understood taxa in the genus, and not much is known about the nature and distribution of its genetic diversity. Five individuals each were selected randomly from 11 populations of O. malampuzhaensis from different altitudinal habitats and were grown in a common-garden experiment for 3 years (1994-1997). Sixty morphological traits and 87 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, generated by 14 random primers, were used to study the genetic variation among the populations. Elevation-dependent phenotypic variation was observed for a suite of metric traits. A scatterplot of mean values for these traits separated the populations from low, middle, and high altitudes into distinct groups. Cluster analysis using RAPD distance grouped the populations according to their altitudinal habitat, and a similar pattern of clustering was observed with respect to morphological distance also. The mean of both RAPD- and morphology-based pairwise genetic distance of populations belonging to similar altitudinal levels differed significantly. These estimates also depicted a significant decrease in genetic distance with increasing altitude. The results demonstrate that (i) effective isolation from gene flow coupled with natural selection governs genetic structure in O. malampuzhaensis and (ii) ecological heterogeneity associated with elevational gradient has a crucial role in the evolution of O. malampuzhaensis.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko, is an economically important pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). An effective means to control the RWA is through the use of resistant cultivars. While a phenotype-based selection has been useful for selection of resistant plants, it has inherent limitations. Screening can only be done during cool months of the year, and symptom expression is influenced by the environment. Pyramiding of two or more RWA resistance genes is also difficult because of the presence of only one aphid biotype in the USA at present. This study was conducted to develop a DNA marker that is tightly linked to Dn2, and to test the effectiveness of the marker as a tag for Dn2 among a limited number of cultivars tested. We report mapping of five microsatellite markers linked to Dn2. The closest marker was Xgwm437 at 2.8 cM, and it distinguished lines containing Dn2 from eight susceptible cultivars and seven resistant cultivars carrying other RWA resistance genes. Xgwm437 should be effective for marker-assisted selection of Dn2-containing plants and for combining Dn2 with other resistance genes in a gene pyramiding program.

AB Aegilops longissima Schw. et Musch. (2n= 2x=14, (SS1)-S-1) and Aegilops sharonensis Eig. (2n=2x=14, (SS1)-S-1) are diploid species belonging to the section Sitopsis in the tribe Triticeae and potential donors of useful genes for wheat breeding. A comparative genetic map was constructed of the Ae. longissima genome, using RFLP probes with known location in wheat. A high degree of conserved colinearity was observed between the wild diploid and basic wheat genome, represented by the D genome of cultivated wheat. Chromosomes 1S(1), 2S(1), 3S(1), 5S(1) and 6S(1) are colinear with wheat chromosomes 1D, 2D, 3D, 5D and 6D, respectively. The analysis confirmed that chromosomes 4S(1) and 7S(1) are translocated relative to wheat. The short arms and major part of the long arms are homoeologous to most of wheat chromosomes 4D and 7D respectively, but the region corresponding to the distal segment of 7D was translocated from 7S(1)L to the distal region of 4S(1)L. The map and RFLP markers were then used to analyse the genomes and added chromosomes in a set of 'Chinese Spring' (CS)/Ae. longissima chromosome additions. The study confirmed the availability of disomic CS/Ae. longissima addition lines for chromosomes 1S(1), 2S(1), 3S(1), 4S(1) and 5S(1). An as yet unpublished set of Ae. sharonensis chromosome addition lines were also available for analysis. Due to the gametocidal nature of Ae. sharonensis chromosomes 2S(1) and 4S(1), additions 1S(1), 3S(1), 5S(1), 6S(1) and 7S(1) were produced in a (4D)4S(1) background, and 2S(1) and 4S(1) in a euploid wheat background. The analysis also confirmed that the 4/7 translocation found in Ae. longissima was not present in Ae. sharonensis although the two wild relatives of wheat are considered to be closely related. The phenotypes of the Ae. sharonensis addition lines are described in an Appendix.

AB Amplified fragment length polymorphism (A-FLP) markers were used to enrich the map of the wheat chromosomal region containing the Thinopyrum-derived Lr19 leaf rust resistance gene. The region closest to Lr19 was targeted through the use of deletion and recombinant lines of the translocated segment. One of the AFLP bands thus identified was converted into a sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker. This assay generated a 130-bp PCR fragment in all Lr19-carrying lines tested, except for one deletion mutant, while non-carrier template failed to amplify any product. This sequence represents the first marker to map on the distal side of Lr19 on chromosome 7el(1). The conversion process of AFLP fragments to STS markers was technically difficult, mainly because of the presence of contaminating fragments. Various approaches were taken to reduce the frequency of false positives and to identify the correct clone. We were able to formulate a general verification strategy prior to clone sequencing. Various other factors causing problems with converting AFLP bands to an STS assays are also discussed.

AB Genetic analysis, particularly the development of genetic linkage maps in forage grass species, lags well behind other members of the Poaceae. Comparative mapping within this family has revealed extensive conservation in gene and marker synteny among chromosomes of diverse genera. Recently, the ability to transfer mapped STS markers between barley and wheat has been demonstrated. The transfer of mapped STS markers between cereals and forage grasses could provide PCR-based markers for comparative mapping in these species providing they amplify homologous sequences. In this study, primers derived from three barley genes of defined function and a gene from Phalaris coerulescens were used to amplify homologous fragments in Lolium perenne. Primers derived from two barley and two oat cDNA clones were also tested along with eight barley and two Triticum tauchii STS markers. Twenty one primer pairs derived from 18 loci were tested. Eleven primer pairs (52%) amplified homologous sequences in L. perenne from ten (55%) of the loci targetted. Thirteen new STS markers were generated in L. perenne, of which ten have been mapped in barley or rye and amplify homologous sequences in L. perenne.

AB Onion (Allium cepa L.; 1C=15,000 Mb) is an agriculturally important plant. The genome of onion has been extensively studied at the conventional cytogenetic level, but molecular analyses have lagged behind due to its large genome size. To overcome this bottleneck, a partial bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of onion was constructed. The average insert size of the BAC library was about 100 kb. A total of 48,000 clones, corresponding to 0.32 genome equivalent, were obtained. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) screening resulted in identification of BAC clones localized on centromeric, telomeric, or several limited interstitial chromosomal regions, although most of the clones hybridized with entire chromosomes. The partial BAC library proved to be a useful resource for molecular cytogenetic studies of onion, and should be useful for further mapping and sequencing studies of important genes of this plant. BAC FISH screening is a powerful method for identification of molecular cytogenetic markers in large-genome plants.

AB Terminal deletions of chromosome 1B in common wheat were selected on a large scale. The gametocidal gene of Aegilops cylindrica was used as the inducer of chromosome breakage. First, genes for endosperm storage proteins located on both arms of chromosome 1B were used as the selection markers. However, it was found that the chromosome breakage occurred during female gametogenesis, causing genotypic inconsistency between the embryo and endosperm. Thus, we isolated plants with terminal deletions in chromosome 1B by C-banding. Of 1327 plants examined, 128 showed aberrations in chromosome 1B: 47 in the short arm, 76 in the long arm, and 5 in both arms. The present deletions tended to have the breakpoint at more proximal regions than those produced previously by T.R. Endo and B.S. Gill. Using 33 deletion lines produced in this study and 34 lines previously produced, we mapped 39 RFLP loci and a nucleolar organizer region (NOR) on a specific region of chromosome 1B. The NOR was found to consist of two subregions with different repetitive units, which were termed NOR-B1d and NOR-B1p. Based on this fine deletion map and genotypic inconsistency between embryo and endosperm, the features of the gametocidal gene are discussed.

AB The Yr9 gene, which confers resistance to stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (P. s. tritici) and originated from rye, is present in many wheat cultivars. To develop molecular markers for Yr9, a Yr9 near-isogenic line, near-isogenic lines with nine other Yr genes, and the recurrent wheat parent 'Avocet Susceptible' were evaluated for resistance in the seedling stage to North American P. s. tritici races under controlled temperature in the greenhouse. The resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique was used to identify molecular markers for Yr9. The BC7:F-2 and BC7:F-3 progeny, which were developed by backcrossing the Yr9 donor wheat cultivar Clement with 'Avocet Susceptible', were evaluated for resistance to stripe rust races. Genomic DNA was extracted from 203 BC7:F-2 plants and used for cosegregation analysis. Of 16 RGAP markers confirmed by cosegregation analysis, 4 were coincident with Yr9 and 12 were closely linked to Yr9 with a genetic distance ranging from 1 to 18 cM. Analyses of nulli-tetrasomic 'Chinese Spring' lines with the codominant RGAP marker Xwgp13 confirmed that the markers and Yr9 were located on chromosome 1B. Six wheat cultivars reported to have 1B/1R wheat-rye translocations and, presumably, Yr9, and two rye cultivars were inoculated with four races of P. s. tritici and tested with 9 of the 16 RGAP markers. Results of these tests indicate that 'Clement', 'Aurora', 'Lovrin 10', 'Lovrin 13', and 'Riebesel 47/51' have Yr9 and that 'Weique' does not have Yr9. The genetic information and molecular markers obtained from this study should be useful in cloning Yr9, in identifying germplasm that may have Yr9, and in using marker-assisted selection for combining Yr9 with other stripe rust resistance genes.

AB Three types of markers-isozymes, RAPDs (random amplified polymorphic DNAs), and wheat microsatellites-were tested on wheat, spelt, and four wild wheat relatives (Aegilops cylindrica, Elymus caninus, Hordeum marinum, and Agropyron junceum). The aim was to evaluate their capability to provide specific markers for differentiation of the cultivated and wild species. The markers were set up for subsequent detection of hybrids and introgression of wheat DNA into wild relatives. All markers allowed differentiation of the cultivated from the wild species. Wheat microsatellites were not amplified in all the wild relatives, whereas RAPDs and isozymes exhibited polymorphism for all species. The dendrograms obtained with RAPD and isozyme data separated Swiss wheat cultivars from those collected in Austria and England, while no difference was found between Swiss spelt and wheat. RAPD data provided a weak discrimination between English and Austrian E. caninus. The microsatellite-based dendrogram discriminated populations of Ae. cylindrica, but no clear separation of H. marinum from E. caninus was revealed. The similarity matrices based on the three different sets of data were strongly correlated. The highest value was recorded between the matrices based on RAPDs and isozymes (Mantel's test, r = 0.93). Correlations between the similarity matrix based on microsatellites and matrices based on RAPDs and isozymes were lower: 0.74 and 0.68, respectively. While microsatellites are very useful for comparisons of closely related accessions, they are less suitable for studies involving less-related taxa. Isozymes provide interesting markers for species differentiation, but their use seems less appropriate for studies of within-species genetic variation. RAPDs can produce a large set of markers, which can be used for the evaluation of both between- and within-species genetic variation, more rapidly and easily than isozymes and microsatellites.

AB The usefulness of the RNA fingerprinting - differential display technique in gene cloning and targeted marker enrichment in wheat is demonstrated. A small region of chromosome 5BL was targeted that contains Ph1, a chromosome-pairing regulator gene. The cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) and mutant ph1b are almost identical except for chromosome 5BL, which, in the mutant line, carries an interstitial deletion encompassing the Ph1 gene. Poly(A)(+) RNA of the two lines from anthers at developmental stages ranging from pre-meiotic mitosis to anaphase II was PCR-amplified using 38 pairwise combinations of 19 primers. The S-35-labeled amplified products were size-separated on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels. A total of 3154 fragment bands were observed, of which 43 were present in CS but absent in the ph1b mutant. These 43 fragment bands were eluted, re-amplified, and used as probes in gel-blot DNA analyses of wheat group 5 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and the ph1b mutant. Twenty-four of these 43 probes were single- or few-copy sequences. Eight of the 24 probes mapped to wheat group 5 and five mapped to the deletion of the ph1b mutant. Three of these five probes were further localized to the submicroscopic region containing the Ph1 gene, by using two deletion lines flanking the region. Northern-blot analysis revealed that the gene corresponding to one of these three probes expresses mainly during meiosis and is from the B genome.

AB The RMV strain of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-RMV) is an unassigned member of the Luteoviridae that causes barley yellow dwarf in various cereal crops. The virus is most efficiently vectored by the aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis, but can also be vectored with varying efficiency by R. padi and Schizaphis graminum. Field collections of alate aphids migrating into the emerging winter wheat crop in the fall of 1994 in central New York identified a high proportion of R. padi transmitting BYDV-RMV. This prompted a comparison of the BYDV-RMV isolates and the R. padi populations found in the field with type virus and aphid species maintained in the laboratory. A majority of the field isolates of BYDV-RMV were similar to each other and to the type BYDV-RMV isolate in disease severity on oar and in transmission by the laboratory-maintained population of R. maidis and a field-collected population of R. maidis. However, several field populations of R. padi differed in their ability to transmit the various BYDV-RMV isolates. The transmission efficiency of the R. padi clones was increased if acquisition and inoculation feeding periods were allowed at higher temperatures. In addition, the transmission efficiency of BYDV-RMV was significantly influenced by the aphid that inoculated the virus source tissue. In general, BYDV-RMV transmission by R. padi was higher when R. padi was the aphid that inoculated the source tissue than when R. maidis was the inoculating aphid. The magnitude of the change varied among virus isolates and R. padi clones. These results indicate that, under certain environmental conditions, R. padi can play a significant role in the epidemiology of BYDV-RMV. This may be especially significant in regions where corn is a major source of virus and of aphids that can carry virus into a fall-planted wheat crop.

AB The present study, undertaken as a continuation of an earlier study on quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of grain protein content (GPC) in bread wheat (Prasad et al. 1999), includes the following: (1) identification of an additional molecular marker associated with GPC; (2) development of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for high GPC; and (3) the use of three sets of NILs (a total of 10 NILs) to validate the two available markers linked with QTL for GPC. A total of 114 sequence tagged microsatellite site (STMS) primer pairs (that were not used in the previous study) were used for detection of polymorphism between the two parents (PH132, with high GPC; WL711, with low GPC) of a mapping population of 100 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). A total of 95 primer pairs.-avc amplification products, of which only 30 detected reproducible polymorphisin between the parental genotypes. Bulked segregant analysis was conducted using these 30 primers on two bulks (each comprising eight RILs) representing the two extremes of the normal distribution. A solitary primer pair (WMC415) showed association with GPC, which was further confirmed through selective genotyping. Subsequently, 100 RILs were genotyped. A single-marker linear regression analysis showed significant association between the marker WMC415 and GPC, thus identifying a quantitative trait locus (designated as QGpc.ccsu-5A1), which explained 6.21% of the variation for GPC among the RILs. The above STMS marker, to.-ether with the STMS marker (WMC41) identified earlier, explains approximately 25% of the variation for GPC, In order to conduct validation of the above two available markers, 10 NILs were developed for high GPC using two genotypes (WL711 and HD2329) with low GPC as recipient parents and another two genotypes (PH132 and PH133) with high GPC as donor parents. NIL 2233 (with 11.7% GPC), derived from HD2329, when tried with WMC41 gave a characteristic amplification profile similar to that of its donor parent PH132, and NIL 2215 (with 11.9% GPC) derived from WL711, when tried with WMC415 gave an amplification profile that resembled its donor parent PH133. The remaining eight NILs with high GPC gave patterns similar to those of their corresponding recipient parents with both the markers, suggesting that either the TL, other than those associated with the above markers, were actually transferred from the donor parents and contributed to high GPC in these NILs or that recombination had occurred between the markers identified and the corresponding QTL. Thus, the marker validation conducted using NILs, while demonstrating the utility of these two microsatellite markers for use in marker-assisted selection in plant breeding, also suggested that many more QTL exist that would need to be identified using closely linked molecular markers.

AB Gene mapping and marker-assisted selection in complex, polyploid genomes still relies strongly on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, as conversion of RFLP to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers can be very difficult. DNA extraction in amounts suitable for RFLP analysis represents the most time consuming and labour-intensive step in molecular marker analysis of plant populations. In this paper. a new flexible method for plant DNA extraction is presented. It allows a high-throughput of samples in a short time without the need for freezing or lyophilizing the plant material. The method allows the isolation of genomic DNA with a yield of = 100 mug for a minimal amount of 200 mug of leaf material. This is sufficient for work with large-genome plant species such as hexaploid wheat, where 20 mug of genomic DNA are required for a single RFLP analysis.

AB Gray leaf spot is a serious disease of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) turf in the United States. Isolates of Pyricularia grisea causing the disease in perennial ryegrass were characterized using molecular markers and pathogenicity assays on various gramineous hosts. Genetic relationships among perennial ryegrass isolates were determined using different types of transposons as probes. Phylogenetic analysis using Pot2 and MGR586 probes, analyzed with AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance), showed that these isolates from perennial ryegrass consist of three closely related lineages. All the isolates belonged to a single mating type, MAT1-2. Among 20 isolates from 16 host species other than perennial ryegrass, only the isolates from wheal (Triticum aestivum) and triticale (x Triticosecale), showed notable similarity to the perennial ryegrass isolates based on their Pot:! fingerprints. The copy number and fingerprints of Pod! and MGR586 in isolates of P. grisea from perennial ryegrass indicate that they are genetically distinct from the isolates derived from rice (Oryza sativa) in the United States. The perennial ryegrass isolates also had the same sequence in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the genes encoding ribosomal RNA as that of the wheat and triticale isolates, and exhibited rice isolate sequence polymorphisms. In pathogenicity assays, all the isolates of P. grisea from Legacy II perennial ryegrass caused characteristic blast symptoms on Marilee soft white winter wheat, Bennett hard red winter wheat, Era soft white spring wheal, and Presto triticale, and they were highly virulent on these hosts. An isolate from wheat and one from triticale (from Brazil) were also highly virulent on perennial ryegrass and Rebel III tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). None of the isolates from perennial ryegrass caused the disease on Lagrue rice, and vice versa. Understanding the population structure of P. grisen isolates infecting perennial ryegrass and their relatedness to isolates from other gramineous hosts may aid in identifying alternate hosts for this pathogen.

AB Seeds of English and Austrian populations of bearded wheatgrass (Elymus caninus L.) and sea barley (Hordeum marinum Huds.) growing in the vicinity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields were collected in order to search for evidence of the introgression of wheat traits into these wild relatives. Seeds were sown and plants grown for subsequent analyses using morphological and genetic (isozymes, RAPD and wheat microsatellites) markers. No F-1 hybrids were found within the individuals of the two species grown, neither with morphological nor with genetic markers. Also, no evidence of introgression of wheat traits into E. caninus was observed. However, in one individual of H. marinum which had the typical morphology of this species, numerous species-specific DNA markers of wheat were amplified, thereby demonstrating previous hybridization. Consequently, the hybridization between wheat and H. marinum under natural conditions and the introgression of wheat traits into this wild relative seems to be possible. Our results contribute to the risk assessment of transgenic wheat cultivation.

AB Soil waterlogging is a major environmental stress that suppresses soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] growth and yield. Our objective was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with the tolerance of soybean to soil waterlogging. We subjected 208 lines of two recombinant inbred (RI) populations, 'Archer' X 'Minsoy' and 'Archer' X 'Noir I', to 2 wk of waterlogging when the plants were at the early flowering stage. The control plants were not flooded. The experiment was conducted in three environments: Columbus, OH, in 1997 and 1998 and Wooster, OH, in 1998. We identified a single QTL, linked to marker Sat_064, from the Archer parent which was associated with improved plant growth (from 11-18%) and grain yields (from 47-180%) in waterlogged environments. This highly significant QTL (P = 0.02-0.000001) was identified in both RI populations and at both Columbus 1997 and 1998 environments, but not at the Wooster 1998 environment. The differences in soil type and flooding treatment (stagnant versus moving water) could have contributed to the lack of QTL identification at the Wooster 1998 environment. The Sat_064 QTL was uniquely associated with waterlogging tolerance and was not associated with maturity, normal plant height or grain yields. The Sat_064 marker maps close to the Rps4 gene for Phytophthora (Phytophthora sojae M.J. Kaufmann & J.W. Gerdemann) resistance; however, since Archer does not contain the Rps4 resistance allele, it is probably not a disease tolerance QTL. Near isogenic lines with and without the Sat_064 marker have been developed and are being field tested under waterlogging conditions to confirm the association of the QTL with the tolerance of soybean to waterlogging stress.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal (syn. Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici), is one of the major diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Race-specific resistance has been extensively used in wheat breeding programs, even though it is ephemeral. Adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew is more durable than race-specific resistance. The APR to powdery mildew in winter wheat cultivar Massey has remained effective since its release in 1981. A cross was made between Massey and a powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Becker. Powdery mildew severity on F-2 leaves (the second leaf below the flag leaf) of 180 F-2:3 lines was rated under natural disease pressure in the field. Among 213 RFLP and 139 microsatellite markers surveyed, 88 (41%) and 90 (65%) markers, respectively, detected polymorphism between Becker and Massey. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to facilitate the identification of molecular markers associated with APR to powdery mildew. Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs), designated as QPm.vt-1B, QPm.vt-2A, and QPm.vt-2B, were identified with interval mapping. They are located on wheat chromosomes 1B, 2A, and 2B, and, respectively, explained 17, 29, and 11% of the total variation of F-2:3 lines for powdery mildew resistance. The three QTLs associated with APR to powdery mildew were derived from Massey, and displayed additive gene action. QPm.vt-2B also fits a recessive model for APR to powdery mildew. In a multi-QTL model, the three QTLs explained 50% of the total variation of F-2:3 lines for APR to powdery mildew. The presence of the three QTLs was confirmed with 97 recombinant inbred (RI) lines, tested for APR to powdery mildew under natural powdery mildew pressure over 3 yr (F-5:6-F-7:8 generation). The molecular markers identified in this study have potential for use in marker-assisted selection and pyramiding of genes for resistance to powdery mildew.

AB Interclass hybridization between soft and hard wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) results in new genetic combinations of potential value. We investigated whether interclass hybridization could improve end use quality of both classes. Our objectives were to analyze quality traits in a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the good quality soft white wheat NY6432-18 (NY18), and good quality hard white wheat Clark's Cream (CC), identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for those traits, and use linkage analysis to determine which parent was contributing favorable alleles at specific QTLs for a given trait. The population was assessed for milling, protein and dough mixing, hydration, cookie and loaf traits. Traits were measured in two to six environments grown over three seasons in Ithaca, NY. The molecular map for the population contains 370 molecular markers including restiction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), microsatellites, and markers derived from known function genes in wheat. Linkage groups have been located to all the wheat chromosomes except for 7D. Pinb derived from the puroindoline b gene on chromosome 5DS was the major QTL for milling, hydration, and cookie baking traits. The major QTL for mixograph peak time was at the Glu-Dyl marker, derived from Glu-D1-2 gene on chromosome 1DL. The Glu-Ax1 and Glu-By1 markers were QTLs for mixograph peak height and tolerance, respectively. QTLs for flour protein quantity were detected on chromosome 2B. With the exception of the hydration traits, multiple regression models included alleles from both parents. Interclass hybridization may be an underexploited wheat breeding strategy for improvement of agronomic and quality traits in wheat.

AB Several non-storage proteins are encoded by genes on individual wheat chromosomes and these have been used as genome-specific markers. In this study, a library of monoclonal antibodies with differing specificities to water- and salt-soluble proteins has been developed in order to obtain markers for different wheat chromosomes. Two antibodies, BCSAU 9D1 and JGM 1B4 were found to bind polypeptides encoded by chromosomes 3D and 7D respectively. Other antibodies bound to small numbers of polypeptides encoded by more than one chromosome. such as 5A, 7D, 5B and 5D. The proteins recognised by some of the antibodies were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography, and one protein was identified as an alpha-amylase inhibitor by N-terminal sequence characterisation. In addition, 16 water-soluble and eight salt-soluble proteins were isolated using SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing, two-dimentional electrophoresis and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with the main objective being to confirm the identity of particular proteins, especially those which were able to be assigned to particular chromosomes. The N-terminal sequencing characterisation identified 19 proteins, whereas four proteins were found to be blocked and one did not match with any proteins in the database. Most of the water-soluble proteins belonged to a family of alpha-amylase inhibitors. One protein, assigned to chromosome 4BS, was homologous to serine carboxypeptidase III. N-terminal sequences of some of salt-soluble proteins matched with internal sequences of barley embryo globulin. Other proteins were identified as lipid transfer protein, peroxidase BP-I precursor and histone H4 proteins. The protein sequences could also potentially used for making antibody or DNA probes for use in selection in breeding programmes. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB A selectable marker system for plant transformation that does not require the use of antibiotics or herbicides was developed. The selectable marker consists of the manA gene from Escherichia coli under the control of a plant promoter that encodes for phosphomannose isomerase, pmi. Only transgenic plants were able to metabolize the selection agent, mannose, into a usable source of carbon, fructose. Transgenic plants were produced efficiently after delivery by Biolistics(TM) of the pmi gene into maize and wheat tissues, with mean transformation frequencies of 45% for maize and 20% for wheat. Adjustment of the sucrose and mannose levels in the selection medium essentially eliminated escapes. Transgenic events can be identified as early as 2 months for wheat and 4 months for maize. A simple test, a modified chlorophenol red assay, was used for early identification of transgenic events expressing the pmi gene. Transformation frequencies for both crops exceeded those obtained with the bar and pat genes with selection on either Basta(R) or bialaphos.

AB In order to estimate the potential of gene flow between wheat (Triticum aestivian L.) and jointed goat-grass (Aegilops cylindrica Host.), we carried out mixed pollinations in experimental and natural conditions. A set of species-specific RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) and microsatellite markers were used to detect the presence of parental markers in the progeny of the plants used in these experiments. No hybrids were found within the offsprings of the plants used for the greenhouse experiments, while 85 Ae. cylindricaxT aestivum hybrids were found within 2400 analyzed F-1 plants resulting from the field pollinations. The hybridization rates for individuals of different populations of the wild species differed considerably: 1% for two populations known for more than 90 years versus 7% for a newly discovered population. Most of the hybrids were completely sterile, but five of them produced 13 seeds (BC1) by backcross with Ae. cylindrica. Twelve seeds germinated and generated viable and partly fertile plants. About 25% of the wheat specific RAPD markers were found in the BC1 plants, indicating that introgression of wheat DNA into Ae. cylindrica is possible. In addition, one microsatellite marker, known to be situated on the D genome (a genome shared by both species), was also found in the BC1 plants.

Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that homoeologous relationships exist between most of the mapped rye loci and comparable mutants in wheat and barley. It was confirmed not only that genes controlling fundamental aspects of plant biology are highly conserved across the Triticeae species but so also were many mutant loci.

AB Motile and non-motile strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 were constructed using different combinations of the lacZY, xylE and aph marker genes which allowed their detection and differentiation in soil, root and seed samples. The survival of motile and non-motile strains was investigated in both non-competitive and competitive assays in water and non-sterile soil. Although there was no difference between strains in water, the motile strain survived in significantly greater numbers than the non-motile strain after 21 days in soil. There was no significant difference between competitive assays, where motile and non-motile cells were co-inoculated into soil, and noncompetitive assays where strains were inoculated separately. Bacterial survival decreased as matric potential increased from -224 to -17 kPa but matric potential had no significant effect on motile compared to non-motile strains. Vertical spread of both motile and nonmotile strains was detected 6.4 mm from the inoculum zone after 14 days in the absence of percolating water. There was no significant difference, for either strain, in distance moved from the inoculum zone after 14, 26 or 40 days. The motile strain had a significant advantage in attachment to sterile wheat roots in both non-competitive and competitive studies. When the spatial colonisation of wheal root systems was assessed in non-sterile soil, there was no significant difference between the motile and non-motile strain from either seed or soil inoculum. However, when the whole root system was assessed as one sample unit, differences could be detected. Bacterial motility could contribute to survival in soil and the initial phase of colonisation, where attachment and movement onto the root surface are important.

AB To provide improved access to the wealth of resources and genomic information that is presently being developed for rice a set of 88 rice expressed sequence tags (ESTs) previously mapped on rice chromosome 1 in the cross 'Nipponbare' x 'Kasalath' was used for comparative mapping in a cross of the barley cultivars 'Igri' and 'Franka'. As expected, most (89%) of the clones gave distinct banding patterns in barley of which about one-third was polymorphic between 'Igri' and 'Franka'. These polymorphisms were mapped, and most of these (56%) confirmed that rice chromosome 1 and barley chromosome 3H are syntenous. All single-copy markers identified conserved collinear positions, while markers with multiple copies did so in a few cases only. The markers that were not fitting in the collinear order were distributed randomly across the barley genome. The comparative maps of barley chromosome 3H and rice chromosome 1 comprise in total 26 common markers covering more than 95% of the genetic length of both chromosomes. A 30-fold reduction of recombination is seen around the barley centromere, and synteny may be interrupted in this region. However, the good overall synteny on a mesoscale (1-10 cM) justifies the use of rice as a platform for map-based cloning in barley.

AB Using wheat ditelosomic lines and in situ hybridization of biotin-labelled DNA probes, 18 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were physically located on homoeologous groups 1 and 3 chromosomes of wheat. Most of the markers hybridized to chromosome arms in a physical order concordant with the genetic maps. A majority of the markers studied were clustered in non-C-banded, distal euchromatic areas, indicating the presence of recombination hot spots and cold spots in those regions. However, on 1BS the markers were well dispersed, which could be due to the abundance of heterochromatin throughout the arm. An inversion between Xpsr653 and Xpsr953 was observed on 1AL. One new Xpsr688 locus, approximately 20-26% from the centromere, was found on 1AS and 1BS. The physical location of Xpsr170 on group 3 chromosomes probably represents an alternative to the loci on the genetic map. Finally, Xpsr313 was mapped to two physical loci on 1DL. Five markers were located to bins consistent with the deletion-based physical maps.

AB Albinism in animals is generally a recessive trait, but in Japan a dominant oculocutaneous albino (OCA) mutant strain has been isolated in rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). After confirming that this trait is not due to a tyrosinase gene mutation that causes OCA1 (tyrosinase-negative OCA), we combined the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) to map the gene involved in dominant oculocutaneous albinism. Four AFLP markers tightly linked to the dominant albino locus were identified. One of these markers was codominant and we have it converted into a GGAGT-repeat microsatellite marker, OmyD-AlbnTUF. Using this pentanucleotide-repeat DNA marker, the dominant albino locus has been mapped on linkage group G of a reference linkage map of rainbow trout. The markers identified here will facilitate cloning of the dominant albino gene in rainbow trout and contribute to a better understanding of tyrosinase-negative OCA in animals.

The presence of the Ae, triuncialis-specific STMS gwm368 homoeoallele along with the non-polymorphic 4BS allele in the rust-resistant derivatives with and without the acrocentric chromosome indicates that the resistance has been transferred from the acrocentric chromosome to either the A or the D genome of wheat. This alien leaf rust resistance gene has been temporarily named as LrTr.

AB Genetic resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is necessary to reduce the wheat grain yield and quality losses caused by this disease. Development of resistant cultivars has been slowed by poorly adapted and incomplete resistance sources and confounding environmental effects that make screening of germplasm difficult. DNA markers for FHB resistance QTLs have been identified and may be used to speed the introgression of resistance genes into adapted germplasm. This study was conduct ed to identify and map additional DNA markers linked to genes controlling FHB resistance in two spring wheat recombinant inbred populations, both segregating for genes from the widely used resistance source 'Sumai 3'.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [teleomorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein.)], or scab, causes severe reductions in yield and quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Evaluation of FHB resistance is laborious and subject to environmental influence; therefore, molecular markers for FHB resistance genes will greatly enhance selection for FHB resistance. This review seeks to summarize information on molecular markers associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to FHB in wheat and barley and the use of those markers for marker assisted selection. Our goal is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the genetics of FHB resistance, the map locations of QTL for FHB resistance, and the future directions and potential applications of this research. In wheat, five types of resistance have been described, and Type If resistance (expressed in Chinese wheat cultivar Sumai 3) is the easiest type to assess. Several research groups are developing molecular markers associated with genes for FHB resistance from Sumai 3, a widely used source of Type II resistance in wheat breeding programs worldwide. In four different populations, each having Sumai 3 or a derivative as one parent, one to four QTL have been identified that explain up to 63% of the variation in resistance. QTL were identified on chromosomes 3BS and 6BL, in three or more populations. Recently, in barley, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers associated with genes for FHB resistance, deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation, and kernel discoloration were identified on all seven chromosomes. Three regions, located on chromosomes 2,3, and 5 were identified in several mapping populations. Comparing the QTL locations between wheat and barley shows that the barley chromosome 3 QTL is located in a syntenous region in wheat. The following areas of research on molecular markers associated with FHB resistance should be emphasized: (i) identifying and mapping better resistance sources in wheat and barley; (ii) validating QTL in additional populations; and (iii) developing markers that can be easily used in breeding programs and across populations.

DT Article
ID SCAB
AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [teleomorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein.)], is a devastating disease that reduces yield, quality and economic value of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The quantitative nature of resistance and tremendous expense of phenotypic screening indicate that the identification of resistant genotypes in breeding populations might be expedited by molecular markers. The markers must be polymorphic and informative across populations for them to be used by breeders. Worldwide, several groups are mapping genes for FHB resistance in wheat and barley and marker discovery is underway. Although these markers may be validated and made breeder-friendly by the laboratories that developed them, the urgency of the FHB situation in North America and worldwide requires efforts to accelerate this process. To take advantage of economies of scale and accelerate information sharing, we propose the establishment of a National Genotyping Center (NGC) for barley and wheat. The immediate objective of the NGC would be to identify and deploy breeder-friendly markers linked to FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL). Over time, we propose that several regional genotyping centers will he established to correspond to regional and market class needs. The NGC would provide the regional centers with high throughput marker systems that would be used to genotype plants in breeding populations submitted by plant breeders. For the long term, we expect that the focus of the NGC will extend beyond FHB resistance, and that a key objective will be the development of new technologies to enhance plant breeding efforts.

All the three Asian species had a species-specific rDNA pattern. In 12 American species studied, eight different rDNA types were found. The type reported previously in H. chilense (the 'chilense' type) was observed in eight American species. The chilense type had double 5S rDNA sites-two sites on one chromosome arm separated by a short distance-and two pairs of major 18S-25S rDNA sites on two pairs of satellite chromosomes. The other seven types found in American species were similar to the chilense type and could be derived from the chilense type through deletion. reduction or addition of a rDNA site. Intraspecific polymorphisms were observed in three American species. The overall similarity in rDNA patterns among American species indicates the close relationships between North and South American species and their derivation from a single ancestral source. The differences in the distribution patterns of 5S and 18S-25S rDNA between Asian and American species suggest differentiation between the I genomes of Asian and American species. The 5S and 18S-25S rDNA sites are useful chromosome markers for delimiting Asian species, but have limited value as a taxonomic character in American species. On the basis of rDNA patterns. karyotype evolution and phylogeny of the I-genome diploid species are discussed.

ID CHROMOSOME
AB Sixteen near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying a marker gene were produced by the recurrent backcrossing method in the genetic background of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Chinese Spring (CS). Three genes from alien species showed segregation distortion. In NILs carrying a marker gene of rye (Secale cereale) or Aegilops caudata, the alien chromosome segments were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The NILs were grown with replications and the effect of marker genes on plant morphology in the genetic background of CS was investigated. These NILs were further crossed with the corresponding monosomics of CS and 13 monosomic lines whose monosome carries a respective marker gene were established and named "marked monosomics." Many of the marked monosomics were distinguishable from the disomic NILs because of the different dosage effect of the genes. The NILs are utilized for studies on gene isolation or gene regulation. Marked monosomics are useful not only for monosomic analysis but also for production of homologous chromosome substitution lines because chromosome observation is not required.

Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 is one bacterial strain that has been demonstrated to promote plant growth by biocontrol of pathogenic fungi. To understand the mode of action of this bacterium, information regarding its localization and metabolic activity on plants is important. In this study, a gfp/luxAB-tagged derivative of P. fluorescens SBW25, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and bacterial luciferase, was monitored during colonization of wheat starting from seed inoculation. Since bacterial luciferase is dependent on cellular energy reserves for phenotypic expression, metabolically active cells were detected using this marker. In contrast, the stable GFP fluorescence phenotype was used to detect the cells independently of their metabolic status. The combination of these two markers enabled P. fluorescens SBW25 cells to be monitored on wheat plants to determine their specific location and metabolic activity. Studies on homogenized wheat plant parts demonstrated that the seed was the preferred location of P. fluorescens SBW25 during the 65-day time period studied, but the leaves and roots were also colonized. Interestingly, the bacteria were also found to be metabolically active on all plant parts examined. In situ localization of P. fluorescens SBW25 using a combination of different microscopic techniques confirmed the preference for the cells to colonize specific regions of the seed. We speculate that the colonization pattern of P. fluorescens SBW25 can be linked to the mechanism of protection of plants from fungal infection.

AB Microsatellite markers Xgwm and Xgdm were used to map the S1, S2, and S3 genes of the induced sphaerococcoid mutants of Triticum aestivum L. and to analyze the introgressive lines of common wheat, obtained by crossing several common wheat cultivars to T. timopheevii Zhuk.; these lines carry the Lr genes of resistance to leaf rust. All sphaerococcoid genes were linked to centromeric markers of the short and long arms of chromosomes of homoeologous group 3 of T. aestivum: the S1 locus was located between the markers Xgdm72 and Xgwm456; the S2 gene, between Xgwm845 and Xgwm566; and the S3 was located between Xgwm2 and Xgwm720. The introgressive lines of common wheat carry the following substitutions from T. timopheevii, most of 2A and 2B and telomeric region of the 5AL chromosome in the line 821, the same introgression and also the completely substituted chromosome 4B in line 837, and the partially substituted chromosomes 2A and 2B in line 842. The introgression of the genomic material from T. timopheevii into the chromosomes of homoeologous group 2 was the common trait of all three lines resistant to leaf rust. The authors discuss the feasibility of using microsatellite-derived data for analyzing nonmapped wheat species, linking new genes to wheat molecular genetic maps, and analyzing wheat genomes of diverse hybrid origins.

AB We have developed a 'genotyping set' of 48 SSR-based genetic markers for application in genetical studies of barley. The SSRs are a subset of a collection of approximately 600 SSRs available to the barley research community. They have been specifically chosen according to the following criteria: (1) they are single locus; (2) their product quality is good under standard assay conditions; (3) they are distributed across the barley genome; and (4) they exhibit reasonably high polymorphic information content (PIC) values in the cultivated barley gene-pool. To maximise genotyping throughput, one of each SSR primer pair was 5 ' end-labelled with either fam, hex or tet fluorochromes to allow automated data capture after running the samples on a DNA sequencer. SSR product sizes were assembled from a reference set of 24 barley genotypes which allowed the construction of 'graphical genotypes' of each of the individual lines. The graphical genotypes provide a convenient tool for interrogating genetic similarity in the individuals surveyed. The product sizes were compared to those obtained from end-labelling one of the primers with P-33 and separating the products by denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography. Although inconsistencies in size were common, they could generally be easily resolved. A reference manual for use of the 'genotyping set' has been produced and is available as a PDF download file at http://www.scri.sari.ac.uk/ssr/pdf. These well-characterised barley SSRs, for the first time, provide a common set of robust PCR-based tools which can be used to integrate and compare information collected from fundamental and/or applied genetic studies on barley in different laboratories across the world.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars vary in traits such as grain hardness and malt quality. However, little is known about the genetic basis of these grain quality traits in barley, while more is known about the basis of grain hardness in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Puroindolines are endosperm-specific proteins found in wheat and barley, as well as other members of the Triticeae. In wheat, variation of puroindoline sequence is associated with most of the variability in wheat grain texture. However, no information exists on sequence variation of the barley homologs of puroindolines, the hordoindolines. We have therefore chosen to isolate and characterize the hordoindoline thin) sequences of eight North American barley cultivars. The barley sequences contain numerous non-conservative amino-acid substitutions relative to their wheat counterparts. However, no significant rearrangements were found in either hinA or hinB of barley. Three hinA and two hinB sequence types were found among the eight barley cultivars examined indicating substantial allelic variation at this locus. The hinB sequence variability was used to map hinB to the short arm of chromosome 5H in a Steptoe/Morex mapping population, which is coincident with the previously mapped location of hinA and Gsp (grain-softness protein). This chromosomal location also coincides with a small barley malt-extract QTL, suggesting that hordoindoline sequence variation may play a small role in barley grain quality. Efforts to correlate barley seed textural differences and malting quality with hordoindoline sequence type are ongoing.

AB Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc) Trotter] is one of the most important cereal crops in Ethiopia. It is an allotetraploid species with a genome size of 720 Mbp. In this paper we report results of genetic linkage-map construction for E. tef using tef and heterologous cDNA probes for the first time. One hundred and sixteen F, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross E. tef cv Kaye Murri x Eragrostis pilosa (accession 30-5) were used for mapping. Parental lines were digested with nine restriction enzymes and screened using 159 tef cDNA and 162 heterologous probes including the grass genome anchor probes. The polymorphism level between parental lines was 66.9%. One hundred and thirty nine polymorphic probes were hybridized against 116 RILs. Both the tef and the heterologous probes hybridized well against tef genomic DNA. The linkage map defined 1,489 cM of the tef genome comprising 149 marker loci distributed among 20 linkage groups. The average interval between markers was 9.99 cM. A fraction (14.8%) of the markers deviated significantly from the expected segregation. Such a genetic linkage map is useful for tagging economically useful genes in tef because a wide range of agronomically important traits is segregating within this population. This would enable the use of a marker assisted breeding strategy which, in turn, will enhance breeding efficiency. Alignment of the tef RFLP map with the rice RFLP map indicates that a number of syntenic chromosomal fragments exist between tef and rice in which the gene order was for the most part collinear. The comparative mapping information should enable tef scientists to take advantage of whatever genetic progress is made on the cereal model species rice.

AB Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling seed dormancy were detected on group 4 chromosomes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using 119 doubled haploid lines (DHLs) derived from a cross between AC Domain and Haruyutaka. A major QTL, designated QPhs.ocs-4A.1, was identified within the marker interval between Xcdo795 and Xpsr115 in the proximal region of the long arm of chromosome 4A. Two minor QTLs, QPhs.ocs-4B.2 on 4B and QPhs.ocs-4D.2 on 4D, were flanked by common markers, Xbcd1431.1 and Xbcd1431.2 in the terminal region of the long arms, suggesting a homoeologous relationship. These three QTLs explained more than 80% of the total phenotypic variance in seed dormancy of DHLs grown in the field and under glasshouse conditions. The AC Domain alleles at the three QTLs contributed to increasing seed dormancy. Comparative maps across wheat, barley and rice demonstrated the possibility of a homoeologous relationship between QPhs.ocs-4A.1 and the barley gene SD4, while no significant effects of the chromosome regions of wheat and barley orthologous to rice chromosome 3 region carrying a major seed dormancy QTL were detected.

AB Crop productivity on acid soil is restricted by multiple abiotic stress factors. Aluminum (Al) tolerance seems to be a key to productivity on soil with a pH below 5.0, but other factors such as Mn toxicity and the deficiency of P, Ca and Mg also play a role. The development of Al-tolerant genotypes of rice is an urgent necessity for improving crop productivity in developing countries. Inhibition of root growth is a primary and early symptom of Al toxicity. The present study was conducted to identify genetic factors controlling the aluminum tolerance of rice. Several parameters related to Al tolerance, most importantly the relative root growth under Al stress versus non-stress conditions, were scored in 188 F-3 selfed families from a cross between an Al-tolerant Vietnamese local variety, Chiembau, and an AI-susceptible improved variety, Omon269-65. The two varieties are both Oryza sativa ssp. indica, but showed a relatively high level of DNA polymorphism, permitting the assembly of an RFLP map consisting of 164 loci spanning 1.715.8 cM, and covering most of the rice genome. A total of nine different genomic regions on eight chromosomes have been implicated in the genetic control, of root and shoot growth under aluminum stress. By far the greatest effects on aluminum tolerance were associated with the region near WG110 on chromosome 1. This region does not seem to correspond to most of the genes that have been mapped for aluminum tolerance in other species, nor do they correspond closely to one another. Most results, both from physiological studies and from molecular mapping studies, tend to suggest that. aluminum tolerance is a complex muIti-genic trait. The identification of DNA markers (such as WG110) that are diagnostic for aluminum tolerance in particular gene pools provides an important starting point for transferring and pyramiding genes that may contribute to the sustainable improvement of crop productivity in aluminum-rich soils. The isolation of genes responsible for aluminum tolerance is likely to be necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of this complex trait.

AB When developing SCARs by sequencing RAPD markers useful for olive variety identification, one RAPD sequence of 407 bp has been identified that shows significant DNA homology with more than 160 retrotransposon-like sequences. A generally coherent phylogenetic tree has been constructed based on the homologous retrotransposon-like sequences, reflecting genetic distances in 35 species belonging to eight kingdoms. The implications of this finding in the development of SCAR markers are discussed. In addition, specific oligonucleotide primers have been developed to amplify the DNA region and have a practical application as an internal amplification control in SCAR-based multiplexed PCRs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a retrotransposon-like element in olive.

AB The 18S-26S ribosomal genes in three closely related species of Leymus (Poaceae: Triticeae) were examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Both approaches revealed a close relationship between L. arenarius (8x = 56, northern European) and L. racemosus (4x = 28. central Eurasian), whereas L. mollis (4x = 28, northern American/Pacific) was distinct. Each species had three homologous pairs of major rDNA loci: a1, a2, and a3 for L. arenarius: mi. m2, and m3 for L. mollis: and r1, r2, and r3 for L. racemosus. Leymus arenarius had in addition three minor loci, a4, a5, and a6. The major loci of L arenarius and L, racemosus were identical, indicating that the former species could have originated from the latter; via interspecific hybridization and/or polyploidy. The rDNA-RFLPs further indicated relationships of these species to other species of Leymus (L. karellini, 8x = 56 and L. angustus, 12x = 84) and Psathyrostachys (P. fragilis, huashanica, P. juncea, and P, lanuginosa, which are all diploids). A phenogram constructed from 20 BamHI, EcoRI, and DraI rDNA fragments revealed closer relationship between the two genera, Leymus and Psathyrostachys, than that among species within a genus.

AB We describe the characterisation and the chromosomal localisation of two repeated DNA sequences, named pLc30 (466 bp long, 64% AT residues) and pLc7 (408 bp long, 61% AT residues), isolated from lentil (Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris) genomic DNA. The pLc30 family is characterised by four internal repeats organised in a head-to-tail orientation, whereas the pLc7 contains many short direct subrepeats. The two families do not share significant sequence similarity. The distribution of these repetitive sequences in different Lens species and in other legumes was investigated. pLc30 is present in all Lens species investigated but absent from other genera examined. In contrast, pLc7 is present also in the genome of other legumes.
   As determined by FISH, the pLc30 sequence hybridises on six out of seven lentil chromosome pairs, while pLc7 hybridises on one only. The distribution of the nine different hybridisation sites of pLc30 allows the discrimination of all seven chromosome pairs and the construction of a karyotype of L. culinaris ssp. culinaris. Additionally, the combination of simultaneous and successive FISH with pLc7, 5S rRNA, 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA genes, and a telomeric sequence allowed the assembly of a physical map based on lentil karyotype.

AB Ten current European wheat varieties were transformed at efficiencies ranging from 1-17% (mean 4% across varieties) following modifications in particle bombardment and tissue culture procedures, All plants surviving phosphinothricin selection were screened for uidA and bar gene activity, and for the presence of marker gene sequences by PCR analysis, A minimum of 35% plant 'escape' frequency was achieved with selection on 4 mg l(-1) gluphosinate ammonium after shoot initiation, Mean co-transformation frequency with various genes-of-interest was 66%. The estimated number of insertions of the uidA gene in 25 lines were; 1-2 in 32%, 3-5 in 52%, and 6-8 in 16% of lines. In T-1 progenies, marker genes segregated in a Mendelian fashion in 50% of 39 lines analysed, as determined by transgene activity assays. Based on PCR analysis, it appeared that in some lines the occurrence of distorted segregation was due to poor transmission of the transgenes.

AB To assist waxy wheat breeding a DNA marker was developed to discriminate mutant and normal alleles at the Wx-D1 locus. This polymerase chain reaction-based marker distinguishes the mutant from the normal allele by targeting the previously reported deletion basis of the mutant. The marker codominantly identifies the normal allele of the Wx-D1 gene from the mutant allele originated from the Chinese landrace 'Baihoumai'. However, attempts with a number of primer combinations targeting this deletion failed to amplify the corresponding fragment from an unrelated wheat line (NP150) that has a mutant null allele at the same locus. This indicates that NP150 has a different mutant allele from that of 'Baihoumai'. This marker is a useful tool to identify wheat cultivars with mutant and normal alleles of the Wx-D1 gene, and is used in marker-assisted selection of the Wx-D1 gene in our waxy wheat breeding programme.

AB Previous studies showed that the intermediate lever of resistance in bread wheat line 'VPM1' to pathotype Ha12 of the cereal cyst nematode could be conferred by an Aegilops ventricosa-derived gene, CreX, in chromosome arm 2AS, which also carries the rust resistance genes Yr17, Lr37 and Sr38. Near isogenic lines (NILs) differing for the presence and absence of the Ae. ventricosa-derived linked genes Yr17/Lr37/Sr38 were tested with cereal cyst nematode. Lines carrying Yr17 produced significantly fewer nematode cysts than the controls. An infested soil experiment produced better differentiation among resistant and susceptible genotypes. Susceptibility of 'Trident' indicated that linkage between CreX and Yr17 is incomplete. Microsatellite markers did not differentiate between 'Trident' and CreX-carrying genotypes. However, Xgwm636 (104) was associated with the presence of Yr17 in all six genetic backgrounds. Since none of the reported cereal cyst nematode resistance genes is located in chromosome 2AS, CreX was designated as Cre5.

AB Among the cereals, rye (Secale cereale L.) can be grown under extreme climatic and poor soil conditions and, is a major crop in North Europe. In the present paper, we report the development of a genetic linkage map of rye using a pooled F-2 mapping population created from a reciprocal cross of two self-fertile inbred lines. The 183 mapped markers consist 139 RFLPs, 19 isozyme and protein markers, 13 microsatellites, 10 known function sequences and two morphological genes. The markers are randomly distributed on the seven chromosomes with a maximum of 38 on chromosome 5R and a minimum of 19 on chromosome 3R. In addition, 23 gene loci and 25 quantitative trait loci were aligned to chromosome regions. For some of the mapped or aligned genes comparable loci are present in other cereals. The homoeologous relationships of these loci are discussed. The potential of the new map for further genetic studies is outlined.

AB The feasibility of identifying inter-simple sequence repeat markers associated with seed weight in hexaploid wheat was tested using 113 recombinant inbred lines developed by the single-seed descent method, from a cross between Rye selection111, an Indian genetic stock obtained through the introgression of genes for bold seed size from rye, and Chinese Spring having small seed size. Three markers were associated with low seed size with gene effects of 14.8%, 9.5%, and 6%, while four markers with contributions of 8%, 4.66%, 2.92% and 2.61% were found to be linked to high seed size, together contributing 31% of the phenotypic variance in seed size. Nulli-tetrasomic and di-telosomic analysis revealed the presence of three low seed size QTL-associated markers on three chromosomes, 6BL, 2DL, and 1DS respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that ISSRs are highly useful for finding markers associated with major and minor genes controlling agronomically important traits in wheat.

AB The population structure and genotypic diversity of Mycosphaerella graminicola from six natural field populations in Germany were studied with molecular markers. To reveal the potential effects of plant host resistance on the pathogen population, hierarchical samples were taken from susceptible and resistant cultivars. A total of 203 single spore isolates was subjected to molecular marker analysis using the amplified fragment length polymorphism technique (AFLP). Among the 203 isolates analyzed, 142 different multilocus haplotypes (MLH) were identified revealing a high degree of genotypic diversity of the M. graminicola population. On average, a F-ST value of 0.04 was found, indicating a low genetic differentiation with only 4% of the genetic variation between the local populations but leaving 96% of the genetic variation within the populations. According to the low F-ST value, a high migration rate of Nm approximate to 12 was found. The observed high within-population diversity, and the significant migration between populations, prevented genetic isolation and differentiation of putative geographically separated populations. Furthermore, plant host resistance had no obvious effect on the population structure and diversity of M. graminicola. Genotypic variability can be attributed to sexual recombination which appears to have a considerably larger influence on the population structure. Gene flow on this scale could have significant implications for plant breeding and fungicide spraying programmes.

AB Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of mannose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. Plant cells lacking this enzyme are incapable of surviving on synthetic medium containing mannose as a carbon source. Maize, wheat and barley plants, genetically modified to express the Escherichia coli manA gene (Pmi) under the control of a plant promoter, were able to survive selection on mannose-containing medium. Transformation frequencies averaged 45% for maize transformation via Biolistics(TM), 35% for maize Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, 20% for wheat, 3% for barley, and 2% for watermelon transformation. Moreover, the frequencies exceeded those obtained for maize and wheat using the pat or bar gene with Basta(R) selection. A preliminary safety assessment has been conducted for PML Purified PMI protein demonstrates no adverse effects in an acute mouse toxicity test. Purified PMI protein was readily digested in simulated mammalian gastric and intestinal fluids. Plants derived from sugar beet and corn cells that had been genetically modified to express the E. coli manA gene were evaluated for biochemical changes in mannose-associated pathways. No detectable changes in glycoprotein profiles were detected in PMI-transformed plants as compared to nontransgenic controls. The yield and nutritional composition of grain from PMI-transformed com plants compared to their non-transformed isogenic counterparts were also determined and no statistically significant differences were found. The inherent safety of a system based on simple sugar metabolism coupled with high transformation frequencies for monocots make pmi an ideal selectable marker for plant transformation.

AB Eleven enzymes from 139 specimens of thirteen Italian populations of Tuber magnatum,tl were analysed with multilocus horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. The research was carried out to obtain insight into the genetic variability of this species across its geographic range. Ail the gene-enzyme systems scored appear to be fixed in homozygosity in accordance with what is hitherto known in the genus Tuber; nine seemed monomorphic, whereas two, that is MDH-1 and ME-2, showed three alleles each. These results indicated a self-reproductive system and the low genetic variability is in agreement with the restricted endemism of the white truffle. The distribution of the electrophoretic types is discussed as a basis for further molecular applications.

AB We describe the development of polymerase chain reaction-based, sequence-tagged site (STS) markers for fine mapping of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) Ror1 gene required for broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei). After locating Ror1 to the centromeric region of barley chromosome 1H using a combined amplified fragment length polymorphism/restriction fragment-length polymorphism ((RFLP) approach, sequences of RFLP probes from this chromosome region of barley and corresponding genome regions from the related grass species oat (Avena spp.), wheat, and Triticum monococcum were used to develop STS markers. Primers based on the RFLP probe sequences were used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify and directly sequence homologous DNA stretches from each of four parents that were used for mapping. Over 28,000 by from 22 markers Were compared. In addition to one insertion/deletion of at least 2.0 kb, 79 small unique sequence polymorphisms were observed, including 65 single nucleotide substitutions, two dinucleotide substitutions, 11 insertion/deletions, and one 5-bp/10-bp exchange. The frequency of polymorphism between any two barley lines ranged from 0.9 to 3.0 kb, and was greatest for comparisons involving an Ethiopian landrace. Haplotype structure was observed in the marker sequences over distances of several hundred basepairs. Polymorphisms in 16 STSs were used to generate genetic markers, scored hv restriction enzyme digestion or by direct sequencing. Over 2,300 segregants from three populations were used in Ror1 linkage analysis, mapping Ror1 to a 0.2- to 0.5-cM marker interval. We discuss the implications of sequence haplotypes and STS markers for the generation of high-density maps in cereals.

AB The small genome of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.) provides an important template for study of closely related large-genome crops such as maize (Zea mays) and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), and is a logical complement to distantly related rice (Oryza sativa) as a "grass genome model." Using a high-density RFLP map as a framework, a robust physical map of sorghum is being assembled by integrating hybridization and fingerprint data with comparative data from related taxa such as rice and using new methods to resolve genomic duplications into locus-specific groups. By taking advantage of allelic variation revealed by heterologous probes, the positions of corresponding loci on the wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice, maize, sugarcane, and Arabidopsis genomes are being interpolated on the sorghum physical may. Bacterial artificial chromosomes for the small genome of rice are shown to close several gaps in the sorghum contigs; the emerging rice physical map and assembled sequence will further accelerate progress. An important motivation for developing genomic tools is to relate molecular level variation to phenotypic diversity. "Diversity maps," which depict the levels and patterns of variation in different gene pools, shed light on relationships of allelic diversity with chromosome organization, and suggest possible locations of genomic regions that are under selection due to major gene effects (some of which may be revealed by quantitative trait locus mapping). Both physical maps and diversity maps suggest interesting features that may be integrally related to the chromosomal context of DNA-progress in cytology promises to provide a means to elucidate such relationships. We seek to provide a detailed picture of the structure, function, and evolution of the genome of sorghum and its relatives, together with molecular tools such as locus-specific sequence-tagged site DNA markers and bacterial artificial chromosome contigs that will have enduring value fur many aspects of genome analysis.

AB A novel plant short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) was identified in the second intron of the acetyl CoA carboxylase gene of Aegilops umbellulata which has been designated "Au", for the host species in which it was discovered. Au elements have a tRNA-related region, direct flanking repeats, and a short stretch of T at the 3' end, which are features common to Au and previously characterized SINEs. Au elements are detected in the genomes of several monocots and dicots by DNA dot hybridization and are also found in the tobacco genome by database searching. Au elements are present at an especially high copy number (approximately 10(4) copies per haploid genome) in wheat and Ae. umbellulata. This suggests a recent amplification of Au in the Triticum and Aegilops species. In situ hybridization revealed a dispersed distribution of Au elements on wheat chromosomes. Au elements were amplified by PCR from monocot and dicot species and the phylogenetic relationships among Au elements were inferred. This phylogenetic analysis suggests amplification of Au elements in a manner consistent with the retrotransposon model for SINE dispersion. The high copy number of Au elements and their dispersed distribution in wheat are desirable characteristics for a molecular marker system in this important species.

AB The Rfm1a gene restores the fertility of msm1 cytoplasmic male-sterile lines in barley. We identified three RAPD markers linked to the Rfm1 locus (CMNB-07/800, OPI-18/900, and OPT-02/700) using isogenic lines and segregating BC1F1 and F-2 populations. Using a previously developed linkage map of barley, we located CMNB-07/800 and OPT-02/700 beside MWG2218 on chromosome 6HS. The linkage between MWG2218 and the Rfm1 locus was demonstrated using the segregating BC1F1 and F-2 populations. To confirm the chromosomal locations of these markers, we converted them to STSs and tested against two sets of wheat-barley chromosome addition lines. These STS markers, CMNB-07/800, OPT-02/700, and MWG2218, were amplified only in the addition lines possessing the chromosome 6H, thereby providing additional evidence the Rfm1 locus is located on chromosome 6H. Homoeologous relationships among fertility restoration genes in Triticeae are discussed.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko, is a serious economic pest of wheat and barley in North America, South America, and South Africa. Using aphid-resistant cultivars has proven to be a viable tactic for RWA management. Several dominant resistance genes have been identified in wheat, Triticum aestivum, including Dn1 in PI 137739, Dn2 in PI 262660, and at least three resistance genes (Dn5+) in PI 294994. The identification of RWA-resistant genes and the development of resistant cultivars may be accelerated through the use of molecular markers. DNA of wheat from near-isogenic lines and segregating F-2 populations was amplified with microsatellite primers via PCR. Results revealed that the locus for wheat microsatellite GWM111 (Xgwm111), located on wheat chromosome 7DS (short arm), is tightly linked to Dn1, Dn2 and Dn5, as well as Dnx in PI 220127. Segregation data indicate RWA resistance in wheat PI 220127 is also conferred by a single dominant resistance gene (Dnx). These results confirm that Dn1, Dn2 and Dn5 are tightly linked to each other, and provide new information about their location, being 7DS, near the centromere, instead of as previously reported on 7DL. Xgwm635 (near the distal end of 7DS) clearly marked the location of the previously suggested resistance gene in PI 294994, here designated as Dn8. Xgwm642 (located on 1DL) marked and identified another new gene Dn9, which is located in a defense gene-rich region of wheat chromosome 1DL. The locations of markers and the linked genes were confirmed by di-telosomic and nulli-tetrasomic analyses. Genetic linkage maps of the above RWA resistance genes and markers have been constructed for wheat chromosomes 1D and 7D. These markers will be useful in marker-assisted breeding for RWA-resistant wheat.

AB A rye linkage map containing clones from rye, wheat, barley, oat and rice genomic and cDNA libraries, known-function genes and microsatellite markers, was created using an F-2 population consisting of 110 F-2-derived F-3 families. Both co-dominant and dominant markers were added to the map. Of all probes screened, 30.8% were polymorphic, and of those polymorphic 79.3% were mapped. The current map contains 184 markers present in all seven linkage groups covering only 727.3 cM. This places a marker about every 3.96 cM on average throughout the map; however, large gaps are still present. The map contains 60 markers that have been integrated from previous rye maps. Surprisingly, no markers were placed between the centromere and C1-1RS in the short arm of 1R. The short arm of chromosome 4 also lacked an adequate number of polymorphic markers. The population showed a remarkable degree of segregation distortion (72.8%). In addition, the genetic distance observed in rye was found to be very different among the maps created by different mapping populations.

AB A cloned gene sequence (Vrga1D), with features of the nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich repeat class of disease resistance (R) gene sequence super family, was previously shown to belong to a family of five gene members derived from a Triticum ventricosum Ces. (syn. Aegilops ventricosa Tausch) segment in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This gene family was introgressed, together with the linked rust resistance genes Yr17, Lr37 and Sr38 from T. ventricosum, to wheat chromosome 2AS. An independently derived T. ventricosum segment carrying a leaf rust resistance gene in a French wheat cultivar, was shown to exhibit a rust resistance response equivalent to Lr37 as well as Yr17 and Sr38. DNA probes from different regions of the Vrga1D clone consistently detected the presence of RFLPs associated with the introgressed segment carrying the resistance genes Yr17, Lr37 and Sr38 present in diverse wheat genotypes from Australia, Canada, France and the UK. Our results showed that the transfer of the T. ventricosum-derived Vrga1 gene members and the rust resistance genes were always accompanied by the loss of a corresponding set of Vrga1-related gene members in recipient wheat cultivars presumed to be of homoeoallelic origin. A PCR assay, based on sequences from the 3'-untranslated region of a Vrga1 gene member isolated from the T. ventricosum donor line of the introgressed segment, was developed. The PCR assay detected the presence of the introgressed rust resistance genes across the diverse wheat backgrounds and should be useful in marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding.

AB Bread wheat lines introgressed with Aegilops ventricosa chromosomes were evaluated for their resistance to the Australian cereal cyst nematode (CCN, Heterodera avenae) pathotype Ha13. Higher levels of resistance relative to the phenotype of the Cre1 CCN resistance gene in wheat were found in the donor Ae. ventricosa parental lines and chromosome-5N(v) substitution or addition lines. The newly identified resistance to pathotype Ha13 on chromosome 5N(v), designated, Cre6, was shown to be independent of the Ae. ventricosa-derived Cre2 gene, effective against several European pathotypes. Another Ae. ventricosa derived gene, Cre5, showed partial resistance to pathotype Ha13. Inhibition of Ha13 female nematode reproduction was ranked in the order Cre6 > Cre1 > CreF greater than or equal to Cre5. Cre6 was inherited as a single dominant locus. Gene sequences encoding nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR) from the Cre3 CCN-pathotype Ha13 resistance locus were used as probes to isolate related sequences from one of the donor Ae. ventricosa parents. Related sequences from Ae, ventricosa (71-73% similarity at the amino-acid level to the Cre3-derived sequences) of chromosome 5N(v) origin were identified and served as diagnostic molecular markers for the presence of 5N(v). CCN-susceptible plants, found as Variants in some of the purported chromosome 5N(v) lines, were also found to be missing the diagnostic 5N(v) RFLP markers assayed by the NBS-LRR probe. An alloplasmic chromosome-5N(v) addition line with Ae. ventricosa cytoplasm in the wheat cultivar, Moisson, background was particularly variable, with 43% CCN-susceptible plants and a corresponding loss of the diagnostic chromosome-5 molecular markers.

AB Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers have become widely used in saturating the region of a gene of interest for the ultimate goal of map-based cloning of the gene or for marker-assisted selection. However, conversion of AFLP markers into restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers will greatly expand their usefulness in genetic applications. Previously, we have identified 15 AFLP markers tightly linked to the Vf gene conferring scab resistance in apple. In this study, we have successfully converted 11 of these AFLPs into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Of the remaining four nonconverted AFLP markers, one, ET2MC8-1, has been found to be very short (83 base pairs) and is an A/T rich (90%) marker; a second, EA2MG11-1, has shown identical sequences between Malus floribunda 821 (the original source of the Vf gene) and scab-susceptible apple cultivars; while the other two, EA12MG16-1 and ET8MG1-1, have not been cloned. Using the 11 converted SCAR markers along with 5 previously identified SCAR markers, a high-resolution linkage map around the Vf gene has been constructed, and found to be consistent with its corresponding AFLP map. Three converted SCAR markers (ACS-3, -7, and -9) are inseparable from the Vf gene; whereas one (ACS-6) is located left of, and the remaining seven (ACS-1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -10, and -11) are located right of the Vf gene at genetic distances of 0.4 and 0.2 cM, respectively. A reliable and robust procedure for development of SCAR markers from AFLP markers is presented.

AB Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) were performed on euploid plants derived from crosses between Oryza sativa (2n = 24, AA) and two brown planthopper-resistant accessions of O. eichingeri (2n = 24, CC). After screening with 164 RFLP markers, 60 of the 67 euploid plants were identified as introgression lines, each carrying 1-6 small O. eichingeri segments integrated on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, or 10. In the somatic chromosome preparations of F-1 hybrid, O. eichingeri chromosomes, fluorescing greenish-yellow in the sequential GISH, appeared to be longer and to contain more heterochromatin than O. sativa ones, and this karyotypic polymorphism can be used to detect some introgressed O. eichingeri segments in euploid plants. In addition, GISH identification presented direct evidence for the transfer of small segments from O. eichingeri to O. sativa chromosome(s) which were subsequently recognized according to their condensation pattern, arm ratio, and chromosome length. The present results would contribute to the molecular mapping and selection of O. eichingeri - derived brown planthopper-resistant gene and positive yield QTLs.

AB A Mycosphaerella graminicola strain transformed with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) downstream of either a carbon source-repressed promoter or a constitutive promoter was used to investigate in situ carbohydrate uptake during penetration of the fungus in wheat leaves, The promoter region of the acu-3 gene from Neurospora crassa encoding isocitrate lyase was used as a carbon source-repressed promoter. The promoter region of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a constitutive promoter. Fluorometric measurement of GFP gene expression in liquid cultures of acu-3-regulated transformants indicated that the N. crassa acu-3 promoter functions in M. graminicola as it does in N. crassa, i.e., acetate induced and carbon source repressed. Glucose, fructose, and saccharose triggered the repression, whereas mannitol, xylose, and cell wall polysaccharides did not. Monitoring the GFP level during fungal infection of wheat leaves revealed that acu-3 promoter repression occurred after penetration until sporulation, when newly differentiated pycnidiospores fluoresced. The use of GFP transformants also allowed clear visualization of M, graminicola pathogenesis, No appressoria were formed, but penetration at cell junctions was observed. These results give new insight into the biotrophic status of M. graminicola.

AB Powdery mildew (caused by Erysiphe graminis) and yellow rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis) are the two most serious wheat diseases found in China. Rye chromosomes, carrying genes for resistance to these diseases, were introduced into common wheat in two generations using chromosome engineering and anther culture. The F-1 hybrids from a cross involving a hexaploid triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) x 'Chinese Spring' nulli-tetrasomic N6DT6A wheat aneuploid line were anther cultured and doubled-haploid plants were regenerated. Using genomic in situ hybridization, C-banding and biochemical marker analyses, one of the anther-cultured lines (ZH-1)studied in derail, proved to be a doubled-haploid with one rye chromosome pair added (1R) and a homozygous 6R/6D substitution (2n = 44). The line was tested for expression of disease resistance and found to be highly resistant to powdery mildew and moderately resistant to yellow rust.

AB Leaf rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina Eriks, is one of the most serious diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum AABBDD, 2n=6x=42) worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is an efficient and economical method of reducing losses to leaf rust. Here we report a new leaf rust resistance gene, Lr39, transferred from Aegilops tauschii into common wheat. Lr39 conditions both seedling and adult plant resistance to the leaf rust pathogen. The inter- and intra-chromosomal mapping of the Lr39 gene showed that it is different from all previously described Lr genes. We used monosomic analysis for the inter-chromosomal mapping and wheat microsatellite markers for the intra-chromosomal mapping. The monosomic and ditelosomic analysis indicated that Lr39 is independent of the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 2D. Eight microsatellite markers for 2DS were used for linkage analysis on a population of 57 F-2 plants derived from a cross of an Ae. tauschii-derived wheat, cv. Wichita line TA4186 (possessing Lr39), with Wichita monosomics for the D-genome chromosomes. The microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the location of the gene on 2DS. Three markers were polymerphic and linked to the gene. The closest marker Xgwma210 mapped 10.7 cM from Lr39. The location of Lr39 near the telomere of 2DS distinguishes it from the Lr2 and Lr22 loci, which are located on 2DS proximal to Xgwm210.

AB A genomic DNA clone coding for a rye secalin gene (gSec2A) was isolated from a wheat translocation line carrying the 2RS.2BL chromosome, using a previously identified partial secalin (Sec2) cDNA clone as a probe. The predicted N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the gSec2A gene was identical to the N-terminal sequence obtained for Sec2 polypeptide bands isolated from SDS-PAGE gels. Bacterially expressed gSec2A protein was identical in size to that of the smallest Sec2 polypeptide band observed on SDS PAGE gels and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for Mr 75000 2RS gamma -secalins. Overall, the predicted protein sequence of gSec2A was most similar (50%) to the family of gamma -gliadins and consists of a short N-terminal region containing one cysteine residue followed by a glutamine/proline-rich repetitive domain and a long C-terminal domain containing eight cysteine residues. The repetitive domain can be divided into two regions. One region coded for 15 units, each consisting of eight amino acids similar in sequence to that found in the omega -secalins and C-hordeins. The second region coded for 17 units each consisting of a sequence of 7-10 amino acids similar to that observed in gamma -gliadins.

AB In this article, we discuss the ways in which our understanding of the controls of nitrogen remobilisation in model species and crop plants have beers increased through classical physiological studies and the use of transgenic plants or mutants with modified capacities for nitrogen or carbon assimilation and recycling. An improved understanding of the transition between nitrogen assimilation and nitrogen recycling will be vital, if improvements in crop nitrogen use efficiency are to reduce the need for excessive input of fertilisers and improve or stabilise yield. In this review, we present an overall view of past work and more recent studies on this topic, using different plants systems and models depicting the biochemical and molecular events occurring during the transition between sink leaves and source leaves. These models may provide a way to identify the nature of the metabolic or developmental signals triggering in a coordinate manner nitrogen and carbon recycling during leaf senescence.
   Another way of developing crop varieties with improved nitrogen use efficiency, and identifying key elements controlling the process of nitrogen remobilisation, is the use of quantitative genetics. We present and discuss recent findings on the genetic variability and basis of nitrogen use efficiency in crops in general and in maize in particular. A genetic approach using maize recombinant inbred lines was undertaken allowing the detection of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for morphological traits, grain yield and its components under high nitrogen or low nitrogen input. Co-mapping was observed between genes encoding enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation (nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase) and these Quantitative Trait Loci. All coincidences were consistent with the expected physiological function of the corresponding enzyme activities. This work strongly suggests that in maize, nitrogen use efficiency can be improved both by marker-assisted selection and genetic engineering.

AB This paper discusses how a genetical approach to plant physiology can contribute to research underpinning the production of new crop varieties. It highlights the interactions between genetics and plant breeding and how the current advances in genetics and the new science of genomics can contribute to our understanding of the genetical control of key agronomic traits - the process of 'translating' traits to identified and mapped genes. Advances in genomics, such as the sequencing of whole genomes and expressed sequence tags, are producing information on genes and gene structures, but without knowing their function. A great deal more biology will be necessary to translate gene structure to function - the process of translating genes to traits. Combining these 'forward' and 'reverse' genetic approaches will allow us to get comprehensive knowledge of the biology of agronomic traits at the physiological, biochemical and molecular levels, so that the 'circuitry' of our crop plants can be elucidated. This will enable plant breeders to manipulate crop phenotype using marker-assisted breeding or genetic engineering approaches with a precision not previously possible.

AB Conditions for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were defined using wheat suspension cells as a model system and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a visual marker. Different strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were compared using established wheat cell suspension cultures, where the frequency of cell clusters showing transient activity of GFP ranged from 2 to 52%. High levels of transient GFP activity and stable transformed callus lines were obtained with plasmid pTO134 containing a gfp gene with an enhanced CaMV 35S promoter and a bar gene with a 35S promoter in combination with Agrobacterium strain AGL0. These results suggest that the important variables in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of wheat cells include media composition, Agrobacterium strain, plasmid vector and the addition of virulence-inducing agents such as acetosyringone. The conditions deemed optimal for transformation of wheat suspension cell lines were applied to scutella isolated from immature embryos and scutella-derived calli. Transient GFP expression in these tissues ranged from 10 to 75% and, while quite variable among and within cultivars, stably transformed scutellum-derived callus was obtained. Further studies with scutellum-derived calli suggested that variables such as duration of pre-inoculation culture and co-cultivation, as well as co-cultivation temperature, were also important. Optimisation of these variables resulted in the recovery of transformed wheat plants at a transformation frequency of 1.8%, which is comparable with other reports.

AB Particle bombardment is a routine method of transformation for wheat (Triticum aestivum L). Particle bombardment parameters, explant tissue and culture, and the choices of DNA constructs are factors that affect successful transformation. This study focuses on the DNA construct. The DNA construct must have a promoter that will function properly in the plant genome for gene expression to occur. Constitutive promoters were evaluated for gene expression in a population of stably transformed wheat callus lines and plants. The promoters were fused to the beta -glucuronidase gene and evaluated for expression by histochemical and chemiluminescent assays. The maize ubiquitin promoter caused significantly higher levels of beta -glucuronidase expression in populations of callus lines and plants than the other promoters evaluated.

To enrich the current gene-pool, modem Czech wheat cultivars were used for the assessment of the potential of old genotypes. Thirty-eight amplification products of different sizes were recorded across the evaluated landraces and cultivars. Specific PCR profiles were amplified for each obsolete cultivar and landrace and for all evaluated modern Czech cultivars. Analysis revealed differences between modern and obsolete cultivars and landraces in the representation of LMW-GS alleles. High variability was found within evaluated obsolete cultivars and landraces. Sufficient evidence has been gained to suggest that obsolete cultivars and landraces can represent a source of alternative LMW-GS alleles for the wheat breeding programs.

AB Grain hardness ("hard" or "soft" kernel texture) is the single most important trait in determining the utilization and marketing of wheat (Triticum aestivum L,), Puroindoline a and b proteins represent the molecular basis for this trait. This study surveyed the prevalence of puroindoline hardness mutations (alleles) among North American spring and winter wheat varieties with emphasis on those that are historically important. Each variety was assessed for kernel texture using the Single Kernel Characterization System; Hardness alleles were defined by puroindoline gene sequence and the presence or absence of puroindoline a protein on polyacrylamide gels. A total of 90 spring wheats were examined: nine were soft and possessed wildtype ("soft") puroindoline sequences, 10 were mixed hardness, and the remaining 71 were uniformly hard. Of these hard spring wheats, 18 carried the Pina-D1b hardness allele (null for puroindoline a protein), 47 the Pinb-D1b allele (Gly-46-Ser-46), and four the Pinb-D1c allele (Leu-60-Pro-60). Two hard spring wheats possessed a new allele, designated Pinb-D1e, which involves a single nucleotide change in Trp-39 to a "stop" codon, Lastly, among the spring wheats, a new hardness allele was found in the hard component of the variety 'Utac' which was mixed, This allele, Pinb-D1f, also involved a single nucleotide change such that Trp-44 became a "stop" codon, A total of 62 winter wheat varieties were examined, of which five were soft and three were of mixed hardness, Of interest, the three mixed hardness wheats were 'Turkey', 'Kharkof, and 'Weston'. The hard component of each carried the Pinb-D1b allele, Of the 54 remaining wheats, all of which were hard, all but two carried this same Pinb-D1b allele, 'Chiefkan' winter wheat carried the same Pinb-D1e allele as 'Canadian Red' and 'Gehun' spring wheats. 'Andrews' hard red winter wheat possessed a new allele, designated Pinb-D1g, which was a single nucleotide change in Cys-56 to a "stop" codon, In conclusion, hard grain phenotype results from one of various mutations in either of the puroindoline proteins. To-date, seven hardness alleles have been discovered and characterized in hexapoid wheat. All but one occur in the puroindoline b gene coding sequence and result from single nucleotide changes, These molecular markers are useful in characterizing lineages and analyzing ancestral relationships.

AB Pathogenicity data from surveys of Puccinia triticina (formerly P. recondita f. sp. tritici) conducted in western Europe in 1995 were analysed to compare the structure of regional populations of the pathogen. Many of the populations differed in phenotypic diversity and pathotypic composition, even though they occurred within a single epidemiological unit, suggesting that local factors may influence the establishment and propagation of individual pathotypes in the regional populations. Neighbouring regions were more similar than distant regions, and all regions shared at least one pathotype, except populations in northern Italy and Scotland. A high degree of similarity was found between populations in northern France and Great Britain, providing strong evidence of free movement of inoculum between these regions. Resistance genes were postulated for a selection of 91 wheat cultivars, representing those most commonly grown in western Europe in 1995. Thirteen cultivars lacked detectable seedling resistance genes and the remaining 78 possessed from one to three resistance genes; those detected were Lr1, Lr3a, Lr10, Lr13, Lr14a, Lr17b, Lr20, Lr26 and Lr37. The most commonly detected resistance gene was Lr13, which was present singly or in combination with other resistance genes in 48 cultivars (53%). The gene Lr14a was detected in 18 cultivars, Lr26 was present in 16 cultivars. The role of host selection in the composition of the regional populations of P. triticina in western Europe in 1995 was difficult to assess on the basis of the results obtained, since virulence data were not available for Lr13 and Lr14a.

AB Asian rice gall midge ( Orseolia oryzae) is a major pest across much of south and southeast Asia. This pest is genetically diverse and many gall midge biotypes are known to exist in each country. During the last three decades, host plant resistance has proved to be the most effective mechanism of controlling the Asian rice gall midge. Seven genes conditioning resistance to gall midge larvae have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa) and are being used in cultivar improvement programs. However, some of these genes are rendered ineffective by new gall midge biotypes. Increased understanding of genetics, inheritance, allelic relationships and linkage is necessary to maximise the durability of major gene resistance by the pyramiding of these genes. The two genes, Gm-2 and Gm-6(t), are known to confer resistance against a number of biotypes in India and China, respectively. An F-3 population derived from a cross between Duokang #1 (donor of Gm-6(t)) and Phalguna (donor of Gm-2) was screened against Chinese gall midge biotype 4 at Guangdong, China, and Indian gall midge biotype 1 at Raipur, India. At each location, separately, a single gene governed resistance. The parallel segregation of 417 F-3 progenies for both biotypes at two locations revealed that recombination had occurred between the two genes, establishing that the two genes are not allelic. However, the two genes Gm-2 and Gm-6(t), were found to be linked with a distance of similar to 16.3 cM. A number of lines homozygous at one locus and segregating for the other locus were identified and selected. These lines were selfed to obtain lines homozygous for the favourable alleles at both loci (two locus pyramids). This is the first report on use of conventional host-pest interaction method for pyramiding two closely located Gm-resistance loci of dissimilar effects. The implications of deployment of these pyramids within and across country borders, with reference to the prevailing gall midge populations are discussed.

AB Yellow rust (stripe rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat throughout the world. Wheat-Haynaldia villosa 6AL.6VS translocation lines R43, R55, R64 and R77, derived from the cross of three species, carry resistance to both yellow rust and powdery mildew. An F-2 population was established by crossing R55 with the susceptible cultivar Yumai 18. The yellow rust resistance in R55 was controlled by a single dominant gene, which segregated independently of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 located in the chromosome 6VS segment, indicating that the yellow rust resistance gene and Pm21 are unlikely to be carried by the same alien segment. This yellow rust resistance gene was considered to be Yr26, originally thought to be also located in chromosome arm 6VS. Bulked Segregation Analysis and microsatellite primer screens of the population F-2 of Yumai 18 x R55 identified three chromosome 1B microsatellite locus markers, Xgwm11, Xgwm18 and Xgwm413, closely linked to Yr26. Yr26 was placed 1.9 cM distal of Xgwm11/Xgwml8, which in turn were 3.2 cM from Xgwm413. The respective LOD values were 21 and 36.5. Therefore, Yr26 was located in the short arm of chromosome 1B. The origin and distribution of Yr26 was investigated by pedigree, inheritance of resistance and molecular marker analysis. The results indicated that Yr26 came from Triticum turgidum L. Three other 6AL.6VS translocation lines, R43, R64 and R77, also carried Yr26. These PCR-based microsatellite markers were shown to be very effective for the detection of the Yr26 gene in segregating populations and therefore can be applied in wheat breeding.

AB The development of comprehensive genetic maps based on molecular markers has increased the power of genetical analysis immensely in the last few years. Characters previously recalcitrant to analysis, such as abiotic stress responses, are now amenable, and individual major genes and QTL mediating the variation can be identified. This has allowed the development of strategies for stress amelioration by adjusting the timing of the life cycle and introducing genes which enable the plant to tolerate stress. These strategies are illustrated here by showing how genes for vernalization response and cold tolerance on chromosomes 5A and 5D of wheat have been identified and located. Additionally, their relationships to genes in other species, such as barley and rice can be characterised through comparative mapping approaches, leading to strategies for their isolation using rice genomic tools.

AB Heterosis appearing in crosses between mutants derived from the same parent variety and crosses of mutants with parent varieties has been observed by many authors for many plant species including such important crops as barley, faba bean, maize, pea, pearl millet, rice, sunflower, sesame, sweet clover, triticale and wheat. Mutant heterosis was reported for crosses of spontaneous mutants, mutants obtained after treatment with various mutagens and recently also for somaclonal variants. The heterotic effects are usually related to an increase in some yield components. There is a lack of correlation between mutation of a particular plant character and appearance of heterotic effect. The yielding performance of a mutant was not correlated with its potential to give yield heterosis in crosses with another mutant, often also a very poor one, or with the parent variety. Poor yielding barley mutants from the collection of semi-dwarf forms of the Department of Genetics, Silesian University gave heterosis in crosses with other mutants or parent varieties for such characters as tillering, grain number and weight per plant. In addition to mutants with deleterious mutations of such characters as chlorophyll synthesis or fasciated stem there were also lines mutated for earliness, semi-dwarfness, low glucoside or high protein and lysine content which gave significant heterosis in crosses. One possible explanation of the phenomenon of mutant heterosis is related to the frequency of mutations induced by chemical and physical mutagens. The appearance and the level of heterotic effect of mutated genes will depend on their interaction with other mutated genes or with genes from the parental genotype. High specific combining ability of mutants giving heterotic effect makes hybrid seed production, based on crosses with defined sources of cytoplasmic or genetic male sterility, unfeasible or even impossible. Doubled haploids provide a unique system to attempt the `fixing' of hybrid performance in homozygous lines and to avoid the step of hybrid seed production. The assumption on the `fixability' of hybrid yield in homozygous lines based on reports that large additive genetic variance is responsible for yield heterosis in wheat or barley was proven also for mutant crosses.

A set of AS-PCR molecular markers of the Glu-A1 and Glu-D1 genes was designed, making use of the minor differences between the sequences of the x1, xNull and x2* of Glu-A1, x2, x5, y10 and y12 of Glu-D1. These markers were applied to assist selection in backcross progenies to improve the glutenin quality in Spanish wheat. The selection was also assisted using other polymorphic systems (AFLPs) in recovering the genetic background of the recurrent parent.

AB A National Wheat Rust Control Program, that has operated in Australia since 1975, provides national pathotype surveys for the three rust pathogens, undertakes ongoing searches for new sources of resistance and carries out genetic analyses of these sources, and provides rust screening and germplasm enhancement support for breeders. The program was expanded in the 1980s to address problems arising from the introduction of wheat stripe rust. A new form of stripe rust, described as barley grass stripe rust, was first detected in 1998. Although virulent on some wheat seedlings this new rust appears to be a greater threat to barley. Molecular markers are expected to make an increasing impact on our ability to select the gene combinations needed to enhance the durability of resistance.

AB Plant breeders are always interested in new genetic resources. In the past, the sources have been limited to existing germplasm. Genetic engineering now provides the opportunity for almost unlimited strategies to create novel resources. As a first stage, the Applied Biotechnology Center (ABC) at CIMMYT developed a method for the mass production of fertile transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that yields plants ready for transfer to soil in 13-14 weeks after the initiation of cultures, and, over the course of a year, an average production of 5-6 transgenic plants per day. CIMMYT elite cultivars are co-bombarded with marker gene and a gene of interest with co-transformation efficiencies around 25-30%. The reliability of this method opens the possibility for the routine introduction of novel genes that may induce resistance to diseases and abiotic stresses, allow the modification of dough quality, and increase the levels of micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamins. The first group of genes being evaluated by the ABC are the pathogenesis related (PR) proteins, such as the thaumatin-like protein (TLP) from barley, chitinase, and 1-3 beta -glucanase. Stable integration of the genes in the genome and inheritance in the progeny were determined by phenotypical analyses that challenged the plants against a wide range of pathogens. Using these genes, we have recovered more than 1200 independent events (confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses) that show responses to the pathogens that range from tolerance to hypersensitive reactions. The quantity and anti-fungal activity of the endogenous thaumatin-like proteins were analyzed in T-1 and T-2 progeny plants. Western blot analyses showed different protein patterns of the wheat endogenous TLPs. Preliminary results indicated that some patterns increased the resistance of transgenic wheat plants to Alternaria triticina. This relationship is being further investigated.

ID WHEAT-GRAIN YIELD; CHROMOSOME 2D
AB A microsatellite marker WMS261 developed at I.P.K., Gatersleben, Germany, co-segregates with the semi-dwarfing gene Rht8. Screens of over 800 wheat varieties from 20 countries show 90% carry WMS-261 alleles with 165, 174 or 192 base pairs (bp). The 192bp allele diagnostic of Rht8 occurs in most screened Southern European varieties. An allele with 165 bp occurs in the majority of CIMMYT Mexican varieties and in most varieties bred in countries that utilize CIMMYT germplasm. Agronomic studies of single chromosome recombinant line mapping populations segregating for WMS 261 alleles with 165, 174 or 192 bp, show compared to the 174bp allele the 192bp allele reduces height by around 8 cm and the 165 bp allele increases height by around 3cm. The results indicate the importance and widespread utilization of Rht8 as a dwarfing gene in southern Europe and suggest an adaptative significance to the height promoting 165 bp allele in CIMMYT material.

AB We developed some wheat-Th. intermedium translocation lines, Yw642, Yw443 and Yw243, etc., showing good BYDV resistance from L1 by induced homoeologous pairing using CS ph mutant. Characterization of these wheat lines was carried out by GISH and RFLP analysis. The results of GISH showed that the lines, YWw42, Yw443 and Yw243, etc., are homozygous wheat- Th. intermedium translocation lines, in which the chromosome segments of Th. intermedium were transferred to the distal end of a pair of wheat chromosomes. RFLP analysis indicated that the translocation chromosome of the wheat lines is T7DS.7DL-7XL. The breakpoint of the translocation is located on the distal end of 7DL, between Xpsr965 and Xpsr680 about 90-99 cm from the centromere. The BYDV gene is located on the distal end of 7XL around Xpsr680, Xpsr687 and Xwg380. The RFLP markers of psr680, psr687 and wg380 were cosegregated with the BYDV resistance respectively and could be used for molecular assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding program for BYDV resistance.

AB Wheat varieties differ in their responses to low temperatures. Genetic studies on frost resistance in wheat are difficult because the effects are quantitative in nature and thus require precise genetic material and reproducible experimental conditions. The detailed diallel analyses indicated that the inheritance of frost resistance is polygenic and mostly additive. Nevertheless, studies using monosomic, ditelosomic and substitution lines have identified specific chromosomes that carry genes responsible for frost resistance. In particular, the chromosomes 5A and 5D appear to carry major genes. Using molecular markers (RFLP, AFLP) and recombinant substitution lines it was shown that the Vrn-A1 (vernalization) and Fr1 (frost resistance) loci were located closely linked on the distal portion of the long arm of 5A, but recombination between them was found (cM = 2). The RFLP markers Xpsr426 and Xwg644 were tightly linked to the Vrn-A1 locus. Loci Vrn-D1 and Fr2 are located on the long arm of 5D. Fr2 and Vrn-D1 are homoeologous to Fr1 and Vrn-A1. A physical map of the Vrn-A1 and Fr1 genes was constructed on chromosome 5A using deletion lines. This cytogenetically based physical map could be useful in further work on genome mapping and gene cloning.

ID WHEAT
AB Chromosome locations of two allele-specific SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) DNA markers in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were found by identifying critical aneuploids obtained by the pollination of haploids. One SCAR, linked to a gene for antibiotic resistance to wheat midge (Sitodiplosis mosellana Gehin) was on chromosome 2B. The second SCAR, linked to one of three genes for white seed color was on 3B. Unemasculated haploids of M11 (resistant & white seeded) were pollinated with BW252 (susceptible & a three-gene red) yielding about 1 hybrid seed per 4 heads pollinated. Out of 94 seeds tested, endosperm DNA of 15 seeds lacked one SCAR or the other, signaling a critical deficiency. These 15 selected seeds gave 9 viable hybrids of which 2 were false negatives. By screening for polymorphic microsatellites, informative markers were obtained for all chromosomes except 7D. Chromosomes missing from marker negative hybrids were inferred from monomorphism of chromosome-specific microsatellites plus meiotic data. Hybrids lacking the midge SCAR lacked 2B from M11 while hybrids lacking the white SCAR lacked all or part of 3B from M11. While some of the aneuploids were complex, simple monosomics were recovered for both 2B and 3B.

AB Genetic capacity for green plant regeneration in anther culture were mapped in a population comprising 50 doubled haploid lines from a cross between two wheat varieties 'Ciano' and 'Walter' with widely different capacity for green plant regeneration. Bulked segregant analysis with AFLP markers and composite interval mapping detected four QTLs for green plant percentage on chromosomes 2AL ( QGpp.kvl-2A), 2BL (QGpp.kvl-2B.1 and QGpp.kvl-2B.2) and 5BL ( QGpp.kvl-5B). The three QTLs detected on chromosome 2AL and 2BL all derived their alleles favouring green plant formation from the responsive parent 'Ciano'. The remaining QTL on chromosome 5BL had the allele favouring green plants from the low responding parent 'Walter'. In a multiple regression analysis the four QTLs could explain a total of 80% of the genotypic variation for green plant percentage. None of the chromosomal regions with QTLs for green plant percentage showed significant influence on either embryo formation or regeneration frequencies from the anther culture. The three major QTLs located on group two chromosomes were fixed in a second DH population derived from two parents `Ciano' and 'Benoist', both with high capacity to produce green plants. A QTL explaining 31.5% of the genetic variation for green plant formation were detected on chromosome 5BL in this cross as well.

AB The use of ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, gamma rays and neutrons and chemical mutagens for inducing variation, is well established. Induced mutations have been used to improve major crops such as wheat, rice, barley, cotton, peanuts, and beans, which are seed propagated. Since the establishment of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of the Nuclear Techniques in Agriculture, more than 1800 cultivars obtained either as direct mutants or derived from their crosses have been released worldwide in 50 countries. In vegetatively propagated plants, many of mutants were derived from irradiating rooted stem cuttings, detached leaves, and dormant plants. According to the FAO/IAEA database, of the 465 mutants released among the vegetatively propagated plants, most are in the floricultural plants and a few in fruit trees. These include chrysanthemum, Alstroemeria, dahlia, bougainvillea, rose, Achimenes, begonia, carnation, Streptocarpus, and azalea. The irradiation of in vitro cultured date palm, apple, potato, sweet potato and pineapple now provides a means to treat large populations which would not have been possible before. Irradiation of micropropagated plants, axillary and adventitious buds, apical meristems, regenerative callus cultures, anthers and microspores, and somatic embryos provides a miniaturized version of trees and seeds in the Petri dish instead of the field. During the last decade, the use of radio-actively labeled probes in recombinant DNA research for cloning and mapping plant genes and transgenesis, particularly for RFLP, microsatellite based DNA fingerprinting, has become a routine procedure. Many homeotic mutants that change floral development have been isolated in Arabidopsis, Petunia, Antirrhinum and Lycopersicon. Mutants of Arabidopsis are being used to analyze genes, which determine response to auxins, cytokinins, gibberellin, abscisic acid and ethylene in plant growth, floral development and senescence, fruit formation and ripening. These mutants are facilitating the isolation, identification and cloning of the genes, which would ultimately help in designing crops with improved yield, increased stress tolerance, longer shelf-life and reduced agronomic inputs. The identification and analysis of mutants by using molecular techniques of DNA fingerprinting and mapping with PCR based markers, such as RAPDs, AFLP and STMS, and mutant tagging shall bring a new dimension in gene technology. Already, mutations can be linked to changes in DNA sequences for some plant traits and to establish molecular maps in structural and functional genomics of crop plants. These in turn would lead to a rapid enhancement of crop yields and quality.

AB Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy (DV) is a diploid (2n = 14, VV genomes), allogamous grass of the Mediterranean region. It may be hybridized with wheat and is thus a gene resource for wheat improvement. We studied grain protein concentration and SDS-sedimentation (SED) as indicators of end-use quality. The latter is a good predictor of gluten strength. A-PAGE and SDS-PAGE were used to identify monomeric and polymeric seed storage proteins, respectively, to relate proteins of DV to those found in Chinese Spring (CS), Triticum aestivum L., wheat. Two full-sib lines of DV had high grain protein (19.3 and 20.3%), but one had very low mean SED (69 mm) and one had very high (118 mm) based on one greenhouse and one field test. CS had very low grain protein (12.0%) and weak gluten (33 mm). Single-DV chromosome addition and substitution lines and two DV-wheat recombinant lines all had higher grain protein than CS (range 13.9 to 16.7%). SED values showed a different pattern. CS+4V and CS+6V had low SED, 63 and 44 mm, similar to CS, whereas CS+1V and full sib DV 200 had very strong gluten, 118 mm, as did substitution lines CS.1V (1A) and CS.1V (1B), 125 and 131 mm, respectively. One hybrid-derived line with DV-wheat 1V recombinant chromosome had SED of 99 mm and one line with a 6V added chromosome had SED of 64 mm. The large positive effects of quality in the wheat having DV chromosome 1V are believed to be due to DV alleles at the Glu-V1 and Gli-V1/Glu-V3 loci. DV chromosomes 4V and 6V did not contribute to improved quality probably due to Gli-V2 and Gli-V3 which, as the orthologous loci in wheat, do not enhance wheat quality. Based on the positive effects of alleles on DV chromosome 1V in a bread wheat background, we conclude that D. villosum is a source of allelic diversity that can be considered for improving end-use quality in bread wheat.

AB Temporal evolution of genetic variability in a Dynamic Management programme of wheat populations was assessed for fitness-related traits and for 29 RFLP markers. Populations of the 1st, 5th and 10th generations were studied. Genetic correlation between plant height (PH) and kernel number (KN) or kernel weight (KW) per plant was high and positive in each population, due to an advantage for the taller plants in intergenotypic competition conditions. This led to a linear increase in PH over generations. On the other hand, KN and KW linearly decreased over generations certainly due to re-allocation of reproductive resources to vegetative functions in the taller plants. On the basis of temporal variation of allelic frequencies of RFLP markers, very low effective sizes (Nc) were estimated: 216 between the 1st and 5th generation, and 157 between the 5th and 10th. These values, much lower than expected from census sizes (approximate to 2650) demonstrated that selection strongly influenced the evolution of neutral loci either by direct hitch-hiking effects and/or by increasing variance of progeny size. The non-significantly different Ne estimates for both periods of time suggested that selection remained constant over the 10 generations. This, result is consistent with the continuous evolution of the quantitative traits. A great heterogeneity of temporal variations was observed among loci, showing the heterogeneity of selective pressures over the genome. Detection of selected loci using genetic markers is discussed.

AB A good understanding of the dynamics of host/pathogen interactions and of the factors that shape the spatial distribution of resistance genes is a prerequisite of metapopulation dynamic management of resistance genes. We studied the diversity and spatial structure of natural populations of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) for resistance to Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causal agent of anthracnose. This study was carried out in Mexico and Argentina both at the phenotypic level and at the molecular level for two families of resistance gene candidates (RGCs). Using a simulation model, we also investigated the effects of migration and selection oil the spatial structure of resistance phenotypes in a metapopulation for two genetic determinisms of the interaction (gone-for-gene and matching allele). Our results showed a differentiation between the countries for all the markers and indicated that the RGC, polymorphic in both countries, do not behave as neutral markers. Comparison of the diversities for resistance to strains isolated from wild or cultivated plants suggested that, although there is local adaptation of C. lindemuthianum between the two countries, the coevolution process seems to occur at a very local scale with the maintenance of resistances to allopatric strains, a result consistent with simulations of the models.

AB The Pacific Northwest (PNW), an important region for wheat production in the USA, is often Subject to water deficits during sowing and grain filling. These deficits reduce the quality and yield of the crop. As a consequence, an important objective of breeding programs in the region is improving the genetic adaptation of wheat cultivars to drought stress. One response to dehydrative stresses is the accumulation of proteins called dehydrins, which are believed to protect membranes and macromolecules against denaturation. We characterized dehydrin accumulation in seedlings during drought stress and its correlation with stress tolerance during grain filling in seven wheat cultivars, 'Connie', 'Gene', 'TAM105', 'Rod', 'Hiller', 'Rhode', and 'Stephens'. A 24-kd dehydrin accumulated in seedlings under stress, but not in irrigated control plants. Connie, TAM105, and Gene started to accumulate dehydrins at the fourth day of stress, while the other cultivars showed dehydrins after twelve days of stress. This differential accumulation in seedlings was associated with stress tolerance at grain filling, characterized by a lower reduction in yield and in the rate of decrease in leaf water potential per day of stress. Connie, TAM105, Gene and Rod where the most tolerant cultivars. The results indicate that expression of this 24-kd dehydrin might serve as a rapid and non-destructive screening technique at the seedling stage. Even though the results are promising, selection experiments using a population segregating for stress tolerance are needed to test more conclusively whether this dehydrin can serve as a genetic marker for cultivars with tolerance to drought stress.

Diverse genetic polymorphisms have been described across Israel in the following systems: allozymes and DNA markers at both macro- and microgeographical scales, alpha and beta amylases; photosynthetic yield; Cab (chlorophyll a/b binding proteins) circadian rhythms; herbicide response; genetic divergence of heat production; salt tolerance; Na-22 uptake; drought and temperature resistance, storage proteins; amino acids; and disease resistances (leaf, stem, and stripe rusts; wheat soil-borne mosaic virus) and their ecological and allozyme and/or DNA marker correlates. Genetic mapping of resistance to chlorotoluron, yellow rust, and powdery mildew on chromosomes 6B, 1BS, and 5BS, respectively, was conducted as a prelude to cloning and transformation. Finally, a genome-wide map of 549 molecular markers (SSR, AFLP, RAPD) was prepared for the ongoing qualitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, including the genetic changes that occurred during domestication. These results strongly support the idea that wild emmer harbors rich genetic resource polymorphisms appropriate for wheat improvement. Cultivar release is a long-term process. Cultivars. that contain T dicoccoides genes encoding resistance to powdery mildew and yellow (= stripe) rust, as well as high protein content and improved baking quality, are expected to be commercially released in the foreseeable future. Thus T. dicoccoides will play a major role in wheat improvement in the third millenium. Finally, in situ conservation is highly recommended to safeguard the evolutionary dynamics and rich genetic resources of T. dicoccoides for future breeding.

AB Galactomannans are composed of a beta 1 -->4 mannan backbone with varying degrees of alpha 1 -->6 galactose substitutions and are found in the cell walls of legume endosperm. Like other cell wall polysaccharides, many factors controlling the metabolism of galactomannans remain to be elucidated. In the endospermous legume senna (Senna occidentalis) increased alpha -galactosidase activity has previously been observed to coincide temporarily with a decrease of the galactose content of the galactomannan. To evaluate the potential role of alpha -galactosidase for the control of the final galactose content, a a-galactosidase gene expressed in immature senna seeds was cloned and transformed into the related high-yielding species guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba). The isolated cDNA encoded a 406 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 44 313 Da. The amino acid sequence was 75% identical to the galactomannan hydrolysing alpha -galactosidases from germinating guar and coffee bean. The senna alpha -galactosidase gene was inserted behind a wheat high-molecular-weight glutenin promoter in the vector employed for transformation of guar by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. About 30% of the guar transformants produced endosperm with galactomannans where the galactose content was significantly reduced. After self-fertilization of primary transformants displaying the highest galactose reduction of the galactomannan, endosperms of R-1 plants were analysed demonstrating that this property was inherited stably to the progeny and that it was 100% coupled to the presence of the senna alpha -galactosidase gene. This suggests that alpha -galactosidases can be involved in the determination of the final galactose content of endosperm galactomannans, demonstrating that cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis can be modified in vivo.

AB Maize (Zea mays), in common with a number of other important crop species, has several glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoforms that have been implicated in the detoxification of xenobiotics via glutathione conjugation. A cDNA encoding the maize GST subunit GST-27, under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, was introduced into explants of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines cv. Florida and L88-31 via particle bombardment, using the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (pat) gene as a selectable marker. All six independent transgenic wheat lines recovered expressed the GST-27 gene. T(1) progeny of these wheat lines were germinated on solid medium containing the chloroacetanilide herbicide alachlor, and tolerance to this herbicide was correlated with GST-27 expression levels. In glasshouse sprays, homozygous T(2) plants were resistant not only to alachlor but also to the chloroacetanilide herbicide dimethenamid and the thiocarbamate herbicide EPTC. These additional GST-27 activities, demonstrated via over-expression in a heterologous host, have not been described previously. T(2) plants showed no enhanced tolerance to the herbicides atrazine (an s-triazine) or oxyfluorfen (a diphenyl ether). In further experiments, T(2) wheat plants were recovered from immature transgenic scutella cultured on medium containing 100 mg/l alachlor, a concentration which killed null segregant and wild-type scutella. These data indicate the potential of the maize GST-27 gene as a selectable marker in wheat transformation.

AB Resistance to Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is not found in wheat but is available in a Thinopyrum intermedium translocation (Ti) carried on chromosome 7DL of bread wheat recombinant lines. We used one of those lines (TC14/2*Spear) to introgress the Ti into bread wheat cultivars and to determine the influence of wheat backgrounds, with and without known tolerance to BYDV, on the expression of resistance. Two single and three backcross populations, segregating for the presence of the alien fragment, were tested under field conditions and artificial inoculation with BYDV isolates MAV-Mex and PAV-Mex. Lines containing the fragment were identified using the microsatellite marker gwm37. Tillering, biomass, grain yield, thousand-kernel weight, and seed quality were evaluated in inoculated and noninoculated plots. Resistance was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In early generations, the alien fragment followed expected Mendelian segregation, whereas in the advanced ones a slight bias against its transmission was observed. No positive nor negative effects of Ti on agronomic performance and quality were found. A significant optical density reduction in individuals carrying the fragment was observed after PAV infection in crosses with lines Anza and Baviacora but not with Milan. In addition, the fragment was associated with a lower frequency of infected plants for both PAV and MAV isolates. The reduced yield loss associated with the presence of the translocation was due largely to the lower infection rate.

AB The waxy proteins from a number of genetic backgrounds of wheat and its progenitors were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The deduced amino acid sequences of the waxy proteins of three diploid progenitor species indicated several key amino acid substitutions, which could explain the differences observed in the electrophoretic mobilities of the wheat waxy proteins. A slight difference observed in the apparent molecular weight of the WX-A1 protein of diploid and polyploid wheat was explained by amino acid subsitutions or variations in predicted protein structures. Further, twelve different partial genomic clones, representing the individual waxy loci of the various diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats, were isolated and compared. The results indicated significant variations in intron 4 and led to identification of sequences unique to the individual waxy genes and genomes of wheat and its proposed progenitors. The sequence variations observed have a great potential for development as molecular markers for identification of specific waxy loci and study, of the various waxy mutants of wheat.

AB Two genetic systems are involved in the control of the plant height in wheat: Rht genes which exert a major effect, and many other genes which usually exert only minor effects on plant height. The purpose of the present study was to identify RFLP markers linked with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with minor effects on plant height. To remove the strong effect of Rht genes, a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between hexaploid wheat, T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring and T. spelta, was used, where neither parents harbor the Rht alleles. Seven RFLP markers on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 2B, 2D, and 4B were linked with plant height. In addition, QTLs associated with morphological characters related to plant height could be identified.

AB The Group 1 late embryogenesis abundant (iea) genes, typified by the wheat Em gene, are expressed to very high levels during the final third of embryo maturation. The structure of Group 1 Lea genes is highly homologous and all contain one small intron at a conserved location in the coding region. Due to the general correlation between the presence of an intron and enhanced expression, it was of interest to determine if the wheat Em intron contributes to high level expression. The intron from the wheat Em gene was embedded in the NH2-terminal region of the beta -glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene coding region such that enzyme activity is dependent on splicing and expression was analyzed in both in vivo and in vitro expression systems. The results show that the Em intron is efficiently spliced (>80%) in transfected rice protoplasts using the normal wheat donor and acceptor sites. However, normalized enzyme activity directed by the intron-containing plasmid is only slightly higher than from an analogous non-intron-containing plasmid. It is further demonstrated that intron-associated enhancement of enzyme activity can be accounted for by differences in spliced GUS mRNA levels and that three novel amino acid codons inserted into the GUS messenger RNA (mRNA) as a result of splicing do not contribute to enhanced expression. We conclude that although this Group 1 Lea intron is able to enhance expression, it does not contribute significantly to high level expression during embryo maturation.

AB Yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis is a wheat disease of world ide importance. The Yr17 resistance gene introgressed from Aegilops ventricosa was effective, in France, against all yellow rust isolates until 1998. The SC-Y15 marker is one of three molecular markers closely linked to SC-Y15. In this paper, results obtained are compared with the molecular marker SC-Y15 and with resistance tests performed at the seedling and adult plant stages on 31 lines from five populations derived from recurrent selection programmes. The resistance tests showed that Yr17 controlled the resistance in seven lines, but that others had additional resistance at the adult stage (18 lines). The molecular test corresponded well with the resistance test in most lines (98% of 156 plants tested). including individual plants that were resistant or susceptible in heterogeneous lines. It also indicated the presence of Yr17 in lines in which it could not be identified by the resistance test because of the presence of other genes. Three of the 156 plants rested appeared to have the gene Yr17 according to the resistance tests, but lacked the molecular marker. These could have resulted from breakage of the linkage. the number being consistent with the estimate of linkage already published. This indicated the need for a resistance test, at least in later stages of breeding programmes, if it is considered essential to have the Yr17 gene present. The use of the selected lines in breeding programmes is also discussed.

Of these, seven markers were cloned and then five which showed a positive specific hybridization signal were sequenced. For these five markers, 30 sequence-specific primers ranging from I4 to 29 bases were designed to amplify genomic DNA from 64 grapevine cultivars under more-stringent PCR conditions. Only, two primer pairs, OpA11(1175)p17R/ p17F and OpD10(800)p14R/p14F still produced a specific SCAR marker, the 'Folle blanche' ScA11(1175) and the 'Malvasia Sitges' ScD10(800) respectively. Moreover, the ScA11(1175) marker was amplified only in 'Folle blanche' among the 64 cultivars tested with a large annealing temperature range using either two different Taq DNA polymerases or two separate thermocyclers. In addition, we discuss the initial polymorphism originated by the RAPD technique and suggest a new design of SCAR primers to obtain reliable cultivar-specific SCAR markers from single PCR-based bands for identification purposes.

AB Hybrid rye breeding and seed production is based on the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)-inducing Pampa (P)-cytoplasm. For restoring male fertility in the hybrids, dominant, nuclear restorer genes are necessary. However, current pollinator lines are only partial restorers. Effective restorers were recently detected in the German inbred line L18 and in materials originating from the Argentinian rye cultivar Pico Gentario and an Iranian primitive rye accession called IRAN IX. F-2 populations were developed for each of these three restorer sources to map the responsible genes by means of RFLP instriction fragment length polymorphism markers. For this purpose, homo- and heterologous DNA probes were used leading to 101 polymorphic marker loci in total. For phenotypic evaluation, 100 to I34 randomly chosen plants From each of the populations were cloned and grown at two or three locations with two plants each. Segregation ratios of pollen fertility in the F-2 populations with L18 and IRAN IX were in accordance with a monogenic dominant inheritance. The segregation pattern for Pico Gentario indicated complementary gene action. Major dominant restorer genes were detected on chromosomes 1RS (L18) and 4RL (Pico Gentario, IRAN IX). The gene on 1RS explained 54% of the phenotypic variation and that on 4 RL 59% and 68% in the Pico Gentario and IRAN IX populations, respectively. Additionally, three minor genes from L18 were identified on chromosomes 3RL, 4RL and 5R. In the Pico Gentario population, a dominant modifier gene contributed by the female parent was found on chromosome 6R. This gene significantly enhanced the expression of the major restorer gene but on its own was not able to restore any degree of fertility. The map-distances between the major restorer loci and at least one flanking marker were small in all three F-2 populations (5-6 cM). In Pico Gentario an unfavorable linkage exists between the major restorer gene and a QTL for plant height. Since highly effective restorers are scarce in actual breeding populations, the major restorer genes detected on chromosomes I RS and 4RL should be introgressed into actual restorer lines. This is facilitated by using the closely linked molecular markers described.

AB For many agronomically important plant genes, only their position on a genetic map is known. In the absence of an efficient transposon tagging system, such genes have to be isolated by map-based cloning. In bread wheat Triticum aestivum, the genome is hexaploid, has a size of 1.6 x 10(10) bp, and contains more than 80% of repetitive sequences. So far, this genome complexity has not allowed chromosome walking and positional cloning. Here, we demonstrate that chromosome walking using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones is possible in the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum (Am genome). BAC end sequences were mostly repetitive and could not be used for the first walking step. New probes corresponding to rare low-copy sequences were efficiently identified by low-pass DNA sequencing of the BACs, Two walking steps resulted in a physical contig of 450 kb on chromosome 1A(m)S. Genetic mapping of the probes derived from the BAC contig demonstrated perfect colinearity between the physical map of T. monococcum and the genetic map of bread wheat on chromosome 1AS. The contig genetically spans the Lr10 leaf rust disease resistance locus in bread wheat, with 0.13 centimorgans corresponding to 300 kb between the closest flanking markers. Comparison of the genetic to physical distances has shown large variations within 350 kb of the contig. The physical contig can now be used for the isolation of the orthologous regions in bread wheat. Thus, subgenome chromosome walking in wheat can produce large physical contigs and saturate genomic regions to support positional cloning.

AB There is a general need for additional selectable marker genes for plant transformation. Only a few have been reported in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) transformation experiments, some of which are under patent restriction or have other disadvantages, A new selectable marker gent! was identified which can be used to select resistant callus in tissue culture and regenerate transgenic wheat plants. A gene from the soil fungus Myrothecium verrucaria (Albertini & Schwein.) Ditmar:Fr., coding Fur the enzyme cyanamide hydratase which converts cyanamide into urea, was previously described. In our wheat transformation experiments, the gene conferred resistance to cyanamide at a tissue culture level and therefore cyanamide could be used to select for transformants, At the whole plant level, progeny of transformed wheat plants showed resistance to cyanamide, whereas sensitive plants expressed a lethal necrosis and yellowing when cyanamide was applied, This gene has several potential advantages when compared with otter selectable marker genes. Transformed wheat plants can be selected at the tissue culture level and may be able to convert cyanamide into a useful nitrogen compound (fertilizer), The selectable marker gene could be introduced with other genes for value-added traits in wheat and might also be applicable in other transformation systems.

AB In situ hybridization was used to map 21 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes to linkage groups 5 and 6 of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell,) in order to compare physical distances and genetic distances between adjacent markers. All 21 probes hybridized to the corresponding homoeologous chromosome arms. The linear order and linkage relationships among the DNA probes on the in situ-based physical maps were generally the same as those on the RFLP-based genetic maps. However, significant differences were observed between the centiMorgan distances on a linkage map and the physical distances of the probes using in situ-based techniques. The results indicated a clustering of polymorphic RFLP markers in the middle of all of the homoeologous group 5 and 6 chromosome arms, This suggests that the available linkage maps do not completely cover the physical length of the chromosomes. As with the genetic maps, the physical map clearly showed the presence of nonhomoeologous rearrangements in the terminal regions of chromosome arms 5AL and 6BS, However, the physical mapping gave an indication of the physical size of the rearrangements as well as their arm location.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) transformation via particle bombardment is now established in many laboratories, but transformation efficiencies are still largely low and the highest efficiencies can only be obtained with certain genotypes. For rapid optimization and improvement of wheat transformation protocols, a non-destructive marker which permits early detection of transformed cells is needed. We have assessed the ability of a modified version of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) to act as a marker for detecting transformed cells and tissues of wheat. Multicellular clusters emitting green fluorescence were observed 14 days after particle bombardment with a sGFPS65T gene construct, and gfp-expressing shoots (often with expressing roots) could be observed as early as 21 days after bombardment. These shoots can be removed from the callus and grown further until they are ready to transfer to soil. Transgenic wheat plants could be selected on the basis of gfp expression alone although the inclusion of antibiotic resistance as a selectable marker could improve the efficiency. Using sgfpS65T as a marker gene in an experiment comparing bombardment parameters allowed the rapid identification of variables that could be targeted for optimization.

AB Reliable and easy to use techniques for chromosome identification are critical for many aspects of cytogenetic research. Unfortunately, such techniques are not available in many plant species, especially those with a large number of small chromosomes. Here we demonstrate that fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) signals derived from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) can be used as chromosome-specific cytogenetic DNA markers for chromosome identification in potato. We screened a potato BAC library using genetically mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism markers as probes. The identified BAC clones were then labeled as probes for FISH analysis. A set of 12 chromosome-specific BAC clones were isolated and the FISH signals derived from these BAC clones serve as convenient and reliable cytological markers for potato chromosome identification. We mapped the 5S rRNA genes, the 45S rRNA genes, and a potato late blight resistance gene to three specific potato chromosomes using the chromosome-specific BAC clones.

AB A detailed RFLP map was constructed of the distal end of the short ann of chromosome 1D of Aegilops tauschii and wheat. At least two unrelated resistance-gene analogs (RGAs) mapped close to known leaf rust resistance genes (Lr21 and Lr40) located distal to seed storage protein genes on chromosome 1DS. One of the two RGA clones, which was previously shown to be part of a candidate gene for stripe rust resistance (Yr10) located within the homoeologous region on 1BS, identified at least three gene family members on chromosome 1DS of Ae. tauschii. One of the gene members cosegregated with the leaf rust resistance genes, Lr21 and Lr40, in Ae. tauschii and wheat segregating families. Hence, a RGA clone derived from a candidate gene for stripe rust resistance located on chromosome 1BS detected candidate genes for leaf rust resistance located in the corresponding region on 1DS of wheat.

AB Most of the published work on transgenic wheat has used tissue culture responsive varieties such as 'Bobwhite'. The aim of the present study was to produce transgenic lines in modern high-yielding wheat cultivars irrespective of their tissue culture potential, using 'Biolistic' approach. Three of the highest yielding Indian wheat cultivars, namely CPAN 3004, Sonalika and UP 2338 were chosen for transformation. Stable transgenic plants with bar (conferring resistance to herbicide Basta) and gus genes were produced in each of these cultivars. Earlier developed transformation and regeneration protocols for tissue culture responsive lines were modified for obtaining transformation frequencies ranging from 0.14 to 0.83%. These frequencies are comparable with the published reports using the most responsive lines. Analysis of co-segregation patterns for bar and gus genes in the R1 progeny of a CPAN 3004 transformant indicated integration at two different sites in the genome. While both the sites have functional gus gene, only one of these has a functional bar gene, giving 15:1 and 3:1 segregation ratios for the two genes, respectively. Expression of bar gene under the maize ubiquitin promoter was high enough to provide protection against topical application of 250 mg/l gluphosinate ammonium, a concentration that killed most of the weeds including Phalaris minor.

AB Neostriatal neurons that produce neurokinin B were investigated immunocytochemically in the rat brain with an antibody against the C-terminal portion of the precursor prepropeptide of neurokinin B, preprotachykinin B (PPTB). PPTB-immunoreactive neurons were scattered throughout the neostriatum and constituted 5.1% of neostriatal neurons. They were immunopositive for projection neuron markers, such as precursor peptides of substance P, enkephalins, and dynorphins, but negative for intrinsic neuron markers, suggesting that PPTB was expressed in neostriatal projection neurons. However, PPTB-immunoreactive neurons were immunonegative for dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, which is known to be produced by striatopallidal and striatonigral neurons. Furthermore, almost no PPTB-immunoreactive axon terminals were observed in the substantia nigra or globus pallidus. The authors then made large kainic acid lesions in the neostriatum to reveal the target; areas of PPTB-producing neurons and observed a decrease in PPTB-immunoreactive fibers in the sublenticular portion of the substantia innominata and, to much lesser extent, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala. After injection of wheat germ agglutinin into the substantia innominata, PPTB immunoreactivity was detected in many retrogradely labeled neostriatal neurons. In contrast, no PPTB immunoreactivity was observed in striatonigral or striatopallidal neurons after injection of retrograde tracers into the substantia nigra or globus pallidus. Thus, neurokinin B-producing neostriatal neurons were considered to send projection fibers predominantly to the substantia innominata. Furthermore, PPTB-immunoreactive axonal swellings were closely apposed to neurokinin B receptor-immunoreactive dendrites in the substantia innominata. Overall, the present results indicate that the rat brain possesses a chemically and hodologically unique neostriatofugal pathway in addition to the direct and indirect pathways.

AB The wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium addition lines Z1, Z2 contain a pair of Th. intermedium chromosomes 2Ai-2 carrying the gene with resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to analyze the chromosome constitution of Z1, Z2 by using genomic DNA probes from th. intermedium and Pseudoroegneria strigosa. The results showed that the chromosome constitution of either Z1 or Z2 composes of 42 wheat chromosomes and two Th. intermedium chromosomes (2Ai-2). The 2Ai-2 chromosome is St-E intercalary translocation, in which the E genomic chromosome segment translocated into the middle region of the long arm of chromosome belonging to St genome. With the genomic DNA probe of Ps. strigosa, the GISH pattern specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome may be used as a molecular cytogenetic marker. A detailed RFLP analysis on Z1, Z2 and their parents was carried out by using 12 probes on the wheat group 2 chromosomes. Twenty RFLP markers specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome were identified. Two RAPD markers of OPR16(-350) and OPH09(-1580), specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome, were identified from 280 RAPD primers. These molecular markers could be used to assisted-select translocation lines with small segment of the 2Ai-2 chromosome and provide tools to localize the BYDV resistance.

AB The satellite region on the short arm of chromosome 1B in wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) carries many agronomically important genes; i.e., genes conferring fungal disease resistance, seed storage proteins, and fertility restoration. To find molecular markers located on the satellite region, we applied the fluorescent AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) technique to aneuploids and deletion stocks of the cultivar T. aestivum 'Chinese Spring'. Out of 6017 fragments amplified with 80 primer combinations in normal 'Chinese Spring', 24 were assigned to 1BS. Twelve of them clustered within a small region of the satellite known to be rich in RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) markers. AFLPs in 1BS and in the whole genome were calculated between 'Chinese Spring' and T. spelta var. duhamelianum. The polymorphism rates in the satellite region (58.3%) and in the 1BS arm (45.8%) were much higher than the average rate for the whole genome (10.7%). Seven of the 12 AFLP markers in the satellite region were revealed to be specific to 'Chinese Spring' and could potentially be useful for genetic mapping in a segregation population of 'Chinese Spring' X T. spelta.

AB Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is the most important grass species in areas with a temperate climate. Biolistic transfer of a ubiquitin promoter driven nptII expression cassette into mature or immature tissue derived calli of perennial ryegrass followed by paromomycin selection, resulted in the rapid and efficient production of fertile transgenic ryegrass plants. Transformation efficiencies after paromomycin selection in combination with the nptII selectable marker compared favourably with hygromycin selection in combination with the hph selectable marker. In total 83 independent nptII expressing plants were produced. Transformation frequency was highly affected by genotype, explant, selection regime and the duration of the callus induction period. The optimised transformation protocol for mature embryo derived calli of turf-type or forage-type cultivars resulted in an average transformation efficiency of 5.2% or 6.6% respectively. This converts into 1.7 or 2.2 independent transgenic plants per bombardment. Immature inflorescence- and immature embryo-derived calli were also successfully used as target for the gene transfer, resulting in transformation efficiencies of up to 3.7% or 11.42% respectively. Transgenic plants were transferred to soil 12 or 9 weeks after excision of mature and immature embryos or inflorescences respectively. Transgene integration and expression were confirmed by PCR and ELISA or western blot analysis. Southern blot analysis confirmed the independent nature of the transgenic lines. The majority of lines showed the integration of two to six transgene copies, while 21% of the analysed lines had a single copy insert. A short tissue culture period in comparison to recently published reports seems to be beneficial for the production of normal and fertile transgenic ryegrass plants. Consequently we report for the first time molecular evidence for sexual transgene transmission in fertile transgenic perennial ryegrass.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease that causes significant reductions in yield and quality in wheat and barley. Barley grains infected with deoxynivalenol (DON), a vomitoxin produced by Fusarium graminearum, are rejected for malting and brewing. Among six-rowed barley cultivars tested thus far, only cv. Chevron exhibited resistance. This study was conducted to map genes and to identify DNA markers for marker-assisted breeding for FHB resistance in cv. Chevron with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. A doubled haploid (DH) population was created from a cross between cv. Chevron and susceptible cv. Stander. Seven field experiments were conducted in four different locations in 2 years. A RFLP map containing 211 loci and covering over 1,000 centimorgans (cM) of the genome was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with relatively low FHB severity and DON concentration. Morphological traits differing between the parents were also measured: heading date, plant height, spike angle, number of nodes per cm of rachis in the spike, and kernel plumpness. Many of the QTL for FHB and DON coincided with QTLs for these morphological traits. The "fix-QTL" algorithm in Mapmaker QTL was used to remove the part of the variance for FHB resistance that may be explained by heading date or plant height. Results from this study suggest that QTLs with major effects for FHB resistance probably do not exist in cv. Chevron. Three QTL intervals, Xcmwg706-Xbcd441 on chromosome 1H, Xbcd307b-Xcdo684b on chromosome 2H, and Xcdo959b-Xabg472 on chromosome 4H, that are not associated with late heading or height may be useful for marker-assisted selection.

AB Leaf rust of barley, caused by Puccinia hordei Otth, is an important foliar disease in most temperate regions of the world. Sixteen major leaf rust resistance (Rph) genes have been described from barley, but only a few have been mapped. The leaf rust resistance gene Rph7 was first described from the cultivar 'Cebada Capa' and has proven effective in Europe. Previously mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers have been used to determine the precise location of this gene in the barley genome. From the genetic analysis of a 'Bowman'/'Cebada Caps' cross, Rph7 was mapped to the end of chromosome 3HS, 1.3 recombination units distal to the RFLP marker cMWG691. A codominant cleaved amplified polymorphic site (CAPS) marker was developed by exploiting allele-specific sequence information of the cMWG691 site and adjacent fragments of genomic DNA. Based on the large amount of polymorphism present in this region, the CAPS marker may be useful for the marker-assisted selection of Rph7 in most diverse genetic backgrounds.

AB We present the first genetic map of wild rice (Zizania paulstris L., 2n=2x=30), a native aquatic grain of northern North America. The map is composed principally of previously mapped RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) genetic markers from rice (Oryza sativa 2n=2x=24). The map is important as a foundation for genetic and crop improvement studies, as well as a reference for genome organization comparisons among Gramineae species. A comparative mapping approach with rice is especially useful because wild rice is grouped in the same subfamily, Oryzoideae, and no other mapping comparison has yet been made within the subfamily. As rice is the reference point for mapping and gene cloning in cereals, establishing a consensus map within the subfamily identifies conserved and unique regions. The genomes of wild rice and rice differ in total DNA content (wild rice has twice that of rice) and chromosome pairs (wild rice=15 versus rice=12). The wild rice linkage map reported herein consists of 121 RFLP markers on 16 linkage groups spanning 1805 cM. Two linkage groups consist of only two markers. Colinear markers were found representing all rice linkage groups except #12. The majority of rice loci mapped to colinearly arranged arrays in wild rice (92 of 118). Features of the map include duplication of portions of three rice linkage groups and three possible translocations. The map gives basic information on the composition of the wild rice genome and provides tools to assist in the domestication of this important food source.

AB While quality in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell.) is a very complex trait, it is known that the water-insoluble gluten proteins are responsible for the elasticity and chohesiveness (strength) of dough and are therefore important determinants of breadmaking quality. High-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits encoded by genes on the long arm of group 1 chromosomes have been associated with gluten strength, and a portion of the variability between cultivars can be attributed to glutenin subunit composition. Good or poor wheat breadmaking quality is associated with two allelic pairs at the Glu-D1 complex locus, designated 1Dx5-1Dy10 and 1Dx2-1Dy12, respectively. Among the HMW glutenin subunits encoded at Glu-B1, Bx7 is quite common, being associated with either of two subunits, By8 or By9. Both allelic pairs contribute moderately well to good breadmaking quality by increasing dough elasticity. Glutenin subunit screening is accomplished using electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In this paper, I report the development of an alternative screening method based on glutenin genes themselves using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This easy, quick and non-destructive PCR-based approach is an efficient alternative to standard procedures for selecting bread-wheat genotypes with good breadmaking characteristics.

AB A major rust resistance gene has been identified in a self-progeny of the sugarcane cultivar R570. Until now, this gene was known to be linked to a marker revealed by the sugarcane probe CDSR29 but unassigned to any linkage group of the current genetic map. We used synteny relationships between sugarcane and three other grasses in an attempt to saturate the region around this rust resistance gene. Comparison of sugarcane, sorghum, maize and rice genetic maps led to the identification of homoeologous chromosome segments at the extremity of sorghum linkage group D, rice linkage group 2, maize linkage group 4 and in the centromeric region of maize linkage group 5. One hundred and eighty-four heterologous probes were selected and tested for cross-hybridization with sugarcane DNA; 106 produced a good hybridization signal and were hybridized on 88 individuals of the R570 selfed progeny. Two hundred and seventeen single-dose markers were added to the R570 genetic map, of which 66% mapped to linkage group VII, together with the rust resistance gene. This gene has now been mapped to the end of a co-segregating group consisting of 19 RFLP markers. None of the mapped loci were located closer to the gene than CDSR29. The gene thus appears to reside at the edge of a "synteny cluster" used to describe the different sass genomes.

ID RECOMBINANT PROTEIN; LIVING CELLS; EXPRESSION; TRANSPORT
AB The secretory pathway is important in actively transporting proteins into the extracellular environment of eucaryotic cells. In this study a green fluorescent protein (GFP) mutant engineered to contain a secretion signal was used as a model protein in order to visualize the secretion process inside insect cells. Fluorescent microscopy indicated that significant amounts of secreted green fluorescent protein (sGFP) accumulated in High-Five, Trichoplusia ni, cells following infection with a baculovirus vector containing the gene under the polyhedrin promoter. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to reconstruct whole cell images of the infected High-Five cells at multiple days postinfection. While the protein was widely distributed at 2 days postinfection, certain intracellular regions appeared to contain higher or lower concentrations of the sGFP. A layer by layer examination indicated pockets in which sGFP was absent, and these appear to be vesicles that have recently released the sGFP or are not yet accumulating sGFP. By 3 days postinfection, the sGFP in some cells was concentrated in a number of widely dispersed globules, which may represent the vesicle remnants of a deteriorating secretory pathway. In contrast, nonsecreted GFP was more uniformly distributed in the cells than sGFP and did not accumulate in vesicles. In addition to GFP, the lectins wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and concanavalin A (ConA), which have affinities for sugar residues, were used to examine the secretory pathway. The WGA, which is a Golgi marker, was distributed around the nucleus prior to infection but then was found to be polarized in one region of the cell following the baculovirus infection. The expansion of other cellular compartments following the baculovirus infection may have caused a change in intracellular distribution of the Golgi. While some of the sGFP was found to colocalize with the WGA label, much of the sGFP was outside this Golgi region. In contrast, ConA labeling, which was not as specific as WGA, was found throughout the cell both before and after infection similar to the sGFP distribution. These studies demonstrate that confocal visualization of fluorescent proteins can be used as an in vivo tool for examining secretory processing in insect cells.

AB In maize (Zea mays L., 2n = 2x = 20), map-based cloning and genome organization studies are often complicated because of the complexity of the genome. Maize chromosome addition lines of hexaploid cultivated oat (Avena sativa L., 2n = 6x = 42),where maize chromosomes can be individually manipulated, represent unique materials for maize genome analysis. Maize chromosome addition lines are particularly suitable for the dissection of a single maize chromosome using radiation because cultivated oat is an allohexaploid in which multiple copies of the oat basic genome provide buffering to chromosomal aberrations and other mutations. Irradiation (gamma rays at 30, 40, and 50 krad) of a monosomic maize chromosome 9 addition line produced maize chromosome 9 radiation hybrids (M9RHs)-oat lines possessing different fragments of maize chromosome 9 including intergenomic translocations and modified maize addition chromosomes with internal and terminal deletions. M9RHs with 1 to 10 radiation-induced breaks per chromosome were identified. We estimated that a panel of 100 informative M9RHs (with an average of 3 breaks per chromosome) would allow mapping at the 0.5- to 1.0-Mb level of resolution. Because mapping with maize chromosome addition lines and radiation hybrid derivatives involves assays for the presence or absence of a given marker, monomorphic markers can be quickly and efficiently mapped to a chromosome region. Radiation hybrid derivatives also represent sources of region-specific DNA for cloning of genes or DNA markers.

AB Three large-insert genomic DNA libraries of common wheat, Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, were constructed in a newly developed transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, which accepts and maintains large genomic DNA fragments stably in both Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The vector contains the cis sequence required for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into grasses. The average insert sizes of the three genomic libraries were approximately 46, 65 and 120 kbp, covering three haploid genome equivalents. Genomic libraries were stored as frozen cultures in a 96-well format, each well containing approximately 300-600 colonies (12 plates for small library, four for medium-size library and four for large library). In each of the libraries, approximately 80% of the colonies harbored genomic DNA inserts of > 50 kbp. TAC clones containing gene(s) of interest were identified by the pooled PCR technique. Once the target TAC clones were isolated, they could be immediately transferred into grass genomes with the Agrobacterium system. Five clones containing the thionin type I genes (single copy per genome), corresponding to each of the three genomes (A, B and D), were successfully selected by the pooled PCR method, in addition to an STS marker (aWG464; single copy per genome) and CAB (a multigene family). TAC libraries constructed as described here can be used to isolate genomic clones containing target genes, and to carry out genome walking for positional cloning.

Using 94 doubled-haploid lines (DH) from the cross of Shyri x Galena, multiple disease phenotype datasets, and a 99-marker linkage map, we determined the number, genome location, and effects of genes conferring resistance to these diseases. We also mapped Resistance Gene Analog Polymorphism (RGAP) loci, based on degenerate motifs of cloned disease resistance genes, in the same population. Leaf rust resistance was determined by a single gene on chromosome 1 (7H), QTLs on chromosomes 2 (2H), 3 (3H), 5 (IH), and 6 (6H) were the principal determinants of resistance to stripe rust. Two-locus QTL interactions were significant determinants of resistance to this disease. Resistance to the MAV and PAV serotypes of BYDV was determined by coincident QTLs on chromosomes 1 (7H), 4 (4H), and 5 (1H), QTL interactions were not significant fur BYDV resistance. The associations of molecular markers with qualitative and quantitative disease resistance loci will be a useful information for marker-assisted selection.

AB The leaf rust resistance gene Lr47 confers resistance to a wide spectrum of leaf rust strains. This gene was recently transferred from chromosome 7S of Triticum speltoides to chromosome 7A of hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum. To facilitate the transfer of Lr47 to commercial varieties, the completely linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) locus Xabc465 was converted into a PCR-based marker. Barley clone ABC465 is orthologous to the type-I wheat sucrose synthase gene and primers were designed for the conserved regions between the two sequences. These conserved primers were used to amplify, clone and sequence different alleles from ir: speltoides and T. aestivum. This sequence information was used to identify the T. speltoides sequence, detect allele-specific mutations, and design specific primers. Cosegregation of the PCR product of these primers and the T. speltoides chromosome segment was confirmed in four backcross-populations. To complement this dominant marker, a cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) was developed for the 7A allele of Xabc465. This CAPS marker is useful to select homozygous Lr47 plants from F-2 or backcross-F-2 segregating populations, and in combination with the T- speltoides specific primers is expected to facilitate the deployment of Lr47 in new bread wheat varieties.

AB Molecular markers were identified in common wheat for the Pm24 locus conferring resistance to different isolates of the powdery mildew pathogen, Erysiphe graminis DM f. sp, tritici (Em. Marchal). Bulked segregant analysis was used to identify amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and microsatellite markers linked to the gene Pm24 in an F-2 progeny from the cross Chinese Spring (susceptible)X Chiyacao (resistant). Two AFLP markers XACA/CTA-407 and XACA/CCG-420, and three microsatellite markers Xgwm106, Xgwm337 and Xgwm458, were mapped in coupling phase to the Pm24 locus. The AFLP marker locus XACA/CTA-407 co-segregated with the Pm24 gene, and XACA/CCG-420 mapped 4.5 cM From this gene. Another AFLP marker locus XAAT/CCA-346 cosegregated in repulsion phase with the Pm24 locus. Pm24 was mapped close to the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 1D, contrary to the previously reported location on chromosome 6D, Pm24 segregated independently of gene Pm22, also located on chromosome 1D. An allele of microsatellite locus Xgwm337 located 2.4+/-1.2 cM from Pm24 was shown to be diagnostic and therefore potentially useful for pyramiding two or more genes for powdery mildew resistance in a single genotype.

AB Dynamic management has been proposed as a complementary strategy to gene banks for the conservation of genetic resources. The evolution of frequencies of genes for specific resistance towards powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f, sp. tritici) in populations of a French network fur dynamic management of bread wheat genetic resources was investigated after 10 years of multiplication without human selection. The objective was to determine whether specific resistance gene diversity was maintained ill the populations and whether any changes could be attributed to selection due to pathogen pressure. Seven populations, originating from four of the network sites, were characterized and compared to the initial population fur six specific resistance gene frequencies detected by nine Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates. Diversity decreased at the population level, but because of a strong differentiation between the populations, this diversity was maintained at the network: level. The comparison of Fst parameters estimated on neutral markers (RFLP) and on resistance gene data revealed that in two of the populations specific resistance genes had bet II selected by pathogen pressure, whereas evolution in two other populations seemed to be the result of genetic drift. For the three last populations, conclusions were less clear, as one had probably experienced a strong bottleneck and the other two presented intermediate Fst values. A dynamic management network with sites contrasted for pathogen pressure, allowing genetic drift in some populations and selection in others, appeared, at least on the short term, to be a good tool for maintaining the diversity of genes for specific resistance to powdery mildew.

AB Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis West., is an important constraint to wheat production in cool environments. With the purpose of identifying genes for resistance to the disease, a RFLP mapping population of recombinant inbred lines developed from a synthetic [Triticum turgidum L. x Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal.] x T. aestivum L. cv. 'Opata 85' cross was visually evaluated for seedling infection type in three greenhouse inoculation tests and for adult-plant disease severity in Pour field tests at Celaya and Toluca, Mexico. A previously unidentified gene from Ae. tauschii, designated as Yr28, was located on chromosome arm 4DS. Although Yr28 strongly influenced seedling resistance, it showed a strong effect in adult plants at only the warmer of the two field sites. A second gene showed high environmental sensitivity in seedling tests, with resistance associated with Opata marker alleles near the adult-plant resistance (APR) gene Yr18 on chromosome arm 7DS. Gene Yr18, known to be present in Opata, strongly reduced disease response in field trials and was tightly linked with leaf-rust resistance gene Lr34. Three other regions from Opata on chromosome arms 3BS, 3DS, and 5DS were also associated with APR.

ID FLOWERING TIME; ARABIDOPSIS; GENETICS
AB Genes Vrn-A(m)1 and Vrn-A(m)2 control the vernalization requirement in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum). The epistatic interaction between these two genes on flowering date was studied here using a factorial analysis of variance. One hundred and two F-2 plants were classified according to their genotypes for molecular markers tightly linked to Vrn-A(m)1 and Vrn-A(m)2. Mean comparisons showed that the Vrn-A(m)2 allele for winter growth habit was dominant to the vrn-A(m)2 allele for spring growth habit and that the Vrn-A(m)1 allele for spring growth habit was dominant to the vrn-A(m)1 allele for winter growth habit. A significant interaction was found between these two genes, suggesting that they work in the same developmental pathway. Plants homozygous for the recessive vrn-A(m)2 allele for spring growth habit flowered earlier than plants from the Vrn-A(m)2 class independently of the alleles present at Vrn-A(m)1. However, differences in heading date between plants with the Vrn-A(m)1 allele and those with the vrn-A(m)1 allele were significant only when the dominant Vrn-A(m)2 allele was present. A genetic model for the action of these two vernalization genes is proposed in which the role of Vrn-A(m)1 is to counteract the Vrn-A(m)2-mediated delay of flowering.

AB Pea (Pisum sativum L.) satellited chromosome reconstructions were analyzed by cytologic markers to identify segregation distortion events, The presence of modified chromosomes was evaluated on the basis of additional rDNA genes, an extra and a longer satellite, all derived from chromosome 5 and chromosome 7 from P. fulvum Sibth, & Sm, The segregation of modified satellited chromosome 5 was monitored through fluorescent in situ hybridization with rDNA probe; it fitted the expected 1:2:1 ratio after self-pollination of a heterozygous genotype for modified chromosome 5, In different genotypes, which were heterozygous for both modified chromosomes 5 and 7, the combined segregation of these chromosomes showed the occurrence of seven karyotype classes instead of the expected nine, The classes with modified chromosome 7 and without modified chromosome 5, whether heterozygous or homozygous, were absent. The hypothesis of gamete selection was rejected since the expected segregation ratio of 5:3:1 was significant by chi-square test. Based on the other hypothesis of postzygotic selection, the segregation ratio did not show a significant deviation from the expected 9:3:1 ratio, thereby indicating that embryo abortion caused the segregation distortion (SD), The hypothesis of the SD system involving two loci carried by the alien satellites of modified chromosomes 5 and 7 is discussed in relation to the evolution of the P, fulvum genome.

AB The highly polymorphic diploid grass Aegilogs tauschii is the D-genome donor to hexaploid wheat and represents a potential source for bread wheat improvement. In the present study microsatellite markers were used for germplasm analysis and estimation of the genetic relationship between 113 accessions of Ae. tauschii From the gene bank collection at IPK, Gatersleben. Eighteen microsatellite markers, developed from Triticum aestivum and Ae. tauschii sequences, were selected for the analysis. All microsatellite markers showed a high level of polymorphism. The number of alleles per microsatellite marker varied from 11 to 25 and a total of 338 alleles were detected. The number of alleles per locus in cultivated bread wheat germplasm had previously been found to be significantly lower. The highest levels of genetic diversity for microsatellite markers were found in accessions from the Caucasian countries (Georgia, Armenia and the Daghestan region of Russia) and the lowest in accessions from the Central Asian countries (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan). Genetic dissimilarity values between accessions were used to produce a dendrogram of the relationships among the accessions. The result showed that all of the accessions could be distinguished and clustered into two large groups in accordance with their subspecies taxonomic classification. The pattern of clustering of the Ae. tauschii accessions is according to their geographic distribution. The data suggest that a relatively small number of microsatellites can be used to estimate genetic diversity in the germplasm of Ae. tauschii and confirm the good suitability of microsatellite markers for the analysis of germplasm collections.

AB Analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with a resistance to fungal invasion within plant tissues (Type II resistance) in the case of Fusarium head blight (FHB) was conducted in doubled haploid lines (DHLs) developed from the cross Fukuho-komugi (moderately susceptible)/ Oligo culm (very susceptible) using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Transgressive segregants of 26 lines with R, MR and M levels of resistance and seven lines with a VS level of resistance were detected in this population of 110 DHLs, using the parental values as standards. It is suggested that the unique configuration of resistance genes is causing the skewed distribution for Type II resistance in this cross. From the results of QTL analysis using 65 RAPD markers in the DHLs, four RAPD markers, OPZ-10(680), OPAG-18(340), OPAF-06(345) and OPW-13(435), associated with Type II resistance were identified. Three RAPD markers were linked with recombination values of 6.4 and 11.8%, These RAPD markers were individually selected by t-test, Hence, it is suggested that the specific regions of the tentatively designated linkage group c of the wheat genome are associated with Type II resistance to FHB, As a result, it may be possible to detect the latent susceptible modifier of Fukuho-komugi using three of them. Finally, the relationship between the characteristics of FHB caused by Fusarium graminearum and resistance mechanisms in wheat was analyzed based on the results of this study and data from the literature for the resistance to FHB, It is suggested that breeding strategies including pyramiding of resistance genes and introgression of additive minor genes in an adapted background may enable to make rapid progress in the breeding of FHB-resistant wheat varieties.

AB The RAPD-PCR technique was used to study genetic variation within and among geographical populations of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), from Morocco and Syria, associated with the fly's ability to overcome resistance in three wheat cultivars containing H5, H13 and H22 resistance genes. Variation was detected both for the level of susceptibility of the cultivars and RAPD profiles of M. destructor populations. By the use of RAPD-PCR, high genetic variability was detected among individuals and populations of M. destructor within and between areas separated geographically. The DNA fingerprints of populations of M. destructor were area-specific with Nei's measures of genetic distance ranging from 0.156 (between Abda and Beni Mellal, Morocco) to 1.977 (between Marchouch, Morocco and Lattakia, Syria). Cluster analysis of the genetic distances among the populations, identified the Syrian population as an outlier. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.81) observed between the genetic and geographic distances among the populations, provided genetic support for dispersal of the fly from its presumed origin in West Asia to Morocco.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is potentially a new source of genes for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement. Wheat-barley chromosome recombinant lines provide a means for introgressing barley genes to wheat genome by chromosome engineering, and since these are expected to occur only rarely in special cytogenetic stocks, an efficient selection skill is necessary to identify them. To convert RFLP markers to barley allele-specific PCR markers useful for effective production of wheat-barley recombinant lines, 91 primer sets derived from RFLP clones which were previously mapped to the barley chromosomes were examined for PCR amplification using 'Chinese Spring' wheat, 'Betzes' barley and the wheat-barley chromosome addition lines. The polymorphisms were detected by an agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products without digestion with restriction enzymes. Out of 81 primer sets producing polymorphisms between the wheat and barley genomes, 26 amplified barley chromosome-specific DNAs which were confirmed to be located on the same chromosome as the RFLP markers by using the wheat-barley chromosome addition lines. These amplified DNAs represent barley allele-specific amplicons, which distinguish barley alleles from their wheat homoeologous counterparts. The present investigation revealed a higher probability for obtaining allele-specific amplicons from genomic DNA-derived RFLP markers than from cDNA-derived ones. The barley allele-specific amplicons developed in this study, namely, four for chromosome 2H, two for 3H, seven for 4H, eight for 5H, one for 6H and four for 7H, are suitable for identifying 'Chinese Spring' wheat- 'Betzes' barley recombinant chromosomes. However, one out of eight barley allele-specific amplicons on chromosome 5H did not detect a unique barley band in a 'New Golden' barley chromosome 5H addition line of 'Shinchunaga' wheat, indicating there may be a need to reconstruct allele-specific amplicons with different barley cultivars.

AB Genetic variation and its distribution within and among 23 populations of Triticum urartu collected from Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Armenia, and Iran was estimated using isozyme markers at eight polymorphic loci. The number of alleles per locus (A= 1.21), percentage polymorphic loci (P= 20.1%), and mean gene diversity (H-e= 0.024) were relatively low. In a population from Lebanon, a high number of alleles per locus (A= 2.13) and percentage polymorphic loci (P= 87.5%) was found. On average, genetic variation among populations (G(ST)= 0.407) was smaller than within-population variation (0.593). However, different patterns of genetic structure were found among various geographic regions. Interpopulation variation was highest for the Iranian populations (0.89) followed by the Turkish populations (0.66). A reverse pattern was observed for the Syrian (0.11) and for the Lebanese (0.13) populations. The Armenian populations exhibited similar interpopulation and within-population variation. Principal component and cluster analyses resulted in distinct grouping of the geographically proximal populations, with the exception of the two Iranian populations. The Turkish populations were different from the neighboring Armenian populations compared to other countries. The populations from southern Syria and those from Lebanon also exhibited a high degree of genetic diversity. The two most heterozygous loci, Mdh-2 and Pgi-2, separated the populations along the first and second principal components, respectively. Most of the rare alleles were scattered sporadically throughout the geographic regions. Rare alleles with high frequencies were found in the Turkish and Armenian populations. These results indicated that different geographic regions require specific sampling procedures in order to capture the range of genetic variation observed in T. urartu populations.

AB Wheat spindle streak mosaic bymovirus (WSSMV) causes an economically important disease of winter wheat in Europe and North America. Artificial inoculation with this virus to identify resistant wheat genotypes is difficult. This study was conducted to identify restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers associated with resistance to this disease. A population, consisting of 104 F-5 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between hexaploid Triticum aestivum cultivars 'Geneva' (resistant) and 'Augusta' (susceptible), was evaluated for WSSMV symptoms under field conditions for four years. Two linked markers on the long arm of chromosome 2D, Xbcd1095 and Xcdo373, were determined to be associated with WSSMV resistance by bulked segregant analysis of the 10 most resistant and 10 most susceptible lines. Marker Xcdo373 accounted for 79% and Xbcd1095 for 73% of the phenotypic variation. Our results suggest that resistance to WSSMV in this population is qualitative in nature and is controlled by few genes. These markers should be useful in the development of wheat cultivars resistant to WSSMV and perhaps also to wheat yellow mosaic bymovirus (WYMV).

AB A 2.2-kb nucleotide sequence rich in AT, located upstream from the Bx7 allele of the high-molecular-weight glutenin Glu-B1 locus in wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Glenlea) was cloned following amplification by PCR. The 5prime region of this sequence contains motifs typically found in matrix attachment regions (MARs) in other plants. We have shown that part of the 2.2-kb DNA binds to wheat nuclear matrix (NM) in vitro, at least as strongly as a known MAR (Adh1) from maize suggesting that there is a MAR upstream of Bx7. This MAR is approximately 800 bases in length running from -750 to -1560 bases, relative to the start codon. Although the MAR is associated with a tissue-specific gene and is beside a strong tissue-specific promoter, the MAR sequence did not lead to tissue-specific expression of the beta-glucuronidase marker gene under the control of the rice actin promoter in various tissues. Presence of the MAR was only slightly beneficial with respect to expression levels, which were not greatly altered in transient expression assays in various wheat tissues although a slight increase in the number of foci was observed in leaves, which have low transformation efficiencies.

AB The genetic basis of heading time in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated through the study of flowering under normal autumn sown field conditions as well as photoperiod responses under a controlled environment. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits were mapped in a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between the wheat cultivars 'Courtot' and 'Chinese Spring'. A molecular marker linkage map of this cross that was previously constructed based on 187 DH lines and 380 markers was used for QTL mapping. The genome was well covered (85%) except for chromosomes 1D and 4D, and a set of anchor loci regularly spaced over the genome (one marker each 15.5 cM) was chosen for marker regression analysis. The presence of a QTL was declared at a significance threshold of alpha = 0.005. The population was grown under field conditions in Clermont-Ferrand, France during two years (1994-1995), in Norwich, U.K. over one year (1998), and also under controlled environments in Norwich. For each trait, between 2 and 4 QTLs were identified with individual effects ranging between 6.3% and 44.4% of the total phenotypic variation. Two QTLs were detected that simultaneously affected heading time and photoperiod response. For heading time, these two QTLs were detected in more than one year. One QTL located on chromosome arm 2BS near the locus Xfbb121-2B, co-segregated with the gene Ppd-B1 known to be involved in photoperiod response. This chromosome region explained a large part of the variation (23.4-44.4% depending on the years or the traits). Another region located on chromosome arm 7BS between the loci Xfbb324-7B and Xfbb53-7B also had a strong effect (7.3-15.3%). This region may correspond to a QTL for earliness per se.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for three traits related to ear morphology (spike length, number of spikelets, and compactness as the ratio between number of spikelets and spike length) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were mapped in a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between the cultivars Courtot and Chinese Spring. A molecular marker linkage map of this cross that had previously been constructed based on 187 DH lines and 380 markers was used for QTL mapping. The genome was well covered (85%) except chromosomes 1D and 4D and a set of anchor loci regularly spaced (one marker each 15.5 cM) were chosen for marker regression analysis. The presence of a QTL was declared at a significance threshold alpha = 0.001. The population was grown in one location under field conditions during three years (1994, 1995 and 1998). For each trait, 4 to 6 QTLs were identified with individual effects ranging between 6.9% and 21.8% of total phenotypic variation. Several QTLs were detected that affected more than one trait. Of the QTLs 50% were detected in more than one year and two of them (number of spikelets on chromosome 2B, and compactness on chromosome 2D) emerged from the data from the three years. Only one QTL co-segregated with the gene Q known to be involved in ear morphology, namely the speltoid phenotype. However, this chromosome region explained only a minor part of the variation (7.5-11%). Other regions had a stronger effect, especially two previously unidentified regions located on chromosomes 1A and 2B. The region on the long arm of chromosome 1A was close to the locus XksuG34-1A and explained 12% of variation in spike length and 10% for compactness. On chromosome 2B, the QTL was detected for the three traits near the locus Xfbb121-2B. This QTL explained 9% to 22% of variation for the traits and was located in the same region as the gene involved in photoperiod response (Ppd2). Other regions were located at homoeologous positions on chromosomes 2A and 2D.

AB Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The objective of this study was to locate and map a recently identified powdery mildew resistance gene, MlRE, carried by the resistant line RE714 using microsatellites uniformly distributed among the whole genome together with a bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The bulks consisted of individuals with an extreme phenotype taken from a population of 140 F-3 families issued from the cross between RE714 (resistant) and Hardi (susceptible). The population had been tested with three powdery mildew isolates at the seedling stage. Qualitative interpretation of the resistance tests located the MlRE gene on the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 6A. A subsequent quantitative interpretation of the resistance permitted us to detect another resistance factor on a linkage group assigned to chromosome 5D, which was constructed with microsatellites for which a polymorphism of intensity between bulks was observed. This quantitative trait locus (QTL) explained 16.8-25.34% of the total variation. An interaction between both the resistant factor (MlRE and the QTL) was found for only one of the isolates tested. This study shows the advantage of making a quantitative interpretation of resistant tests and that the use of microsatellites combined with BSA is a powerful strategy to locate resistance genes in wheat.

AB The present study in bread wheat was undertaken, firstly to identify chromosomes carrying QTLs controlling 1000 grain weight (GW) and, secondly: to develop molecular marker(s) linked with this trait. Using the genotype Rye Selection111 (RS111), we carried out a monosomic analysis that suggested that 8 chromosomes (1A, 1D, 2B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7A and 7D) carried QTLs controlling GW, with only 3 of these (1A, 2B, 7A) carrying alleles for high GW. To tag the QTLs present on these chromosomes, we crossed the genotype RS111 with high GW (56.83 g) with the genotype Chinese Spring (CS) with low GW (23.74 g) and obtained 100 Rns. These RILs showed normal distribution for GW.
   The parental genotypes were analysed with as many as 346 STMS primer pairs for detection of polymorphism. Of these, 267 primer pairs gave scorable amplification products, 63 of which detected polymorphism between the parents. Using each of these 63 primer pairs, we carried out bulked segregant analysis on RILs representing two extremes of the distribution. One primer pair (WMC333) showed an association of the marker locus Xwmc333 with grain weight. This was confirmed through selective genotyping, and the co-segregation data on molecular marker locus Xwmc333 and GW were analysed following a single marker linear regression approach. Significant regression suggested linkage between Xwmc333 and a QTL for GW. The results showed that the above QTL accounted for 15.09% of the variation for GW between the parents. The marker has been located on chromosome arm 1AS, and QTL was designated QGw1.ccsu-1A.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity limits crop productivity in acidic soils. As with many crops, natural genetic variation for Al tolerance has been found in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Al tolerance can be evaluated by replicated field trials, by soil bioassays in pots, or by solution culture methods. To date, alternative marker-assisted methods of Al tolerance selection in barley have not been developed. The goal of this study was to identify molecular markers for Alp, a gene in the barley cv Dayton that confers a high level of Al tolerance. An FZ mapping population was generated from a cross between Dayton and the more aluminum-sensitive cv Harlan Hybrid. Al tolerance in this population was scored by hematoxylin staining, and was confirmed to segregate in a monogenic fashion. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping of Alp was undertaken, and it was localized to the long arm of chromosome 4H, 2.1 cM proximal to the marker Xbcd1117 and 2.1 cM distal to the markers Xwg464 and Xcdo1395. These markers can be used for marker-assisted selection of Al tolerance in barley without the need for field trials, soil bioassays, or solution culture analysis. Further, the linkage between Xcdo1395 and Alp is interesting because this marker is also linked to the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Al tolerance gene Alb, located on the long arm of chromosome 4D. This result is suggestive of the possibility that Al tolerance in barley and wheat may be due to the action of orthologous loci.

AB Embryogenic cell lines of Gladiolus were bombarded with the bar-uidA fusion gene under the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (pDM327) or cobombarded with uidA under the CaMV 35S promoter (pBCG) and bar under the CaMV 35S promoter (pDM307). Over 500 cell lines were isolated for either die fusion gene or cobombarded cells following selection on Murashige and Skoog's medium supplemented with 2 mg l(-1) (9 mu M) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 6 mg l(-1) phosphinothricin. The optimum DNA concentration for isolating stable transformants was one-tenth that for optimal isolation of lines with gus expression, and three times as many cell lines were isolated following cobombardment as compared to bombardment with the bar-uidA fusion gene. Three times as many cell lines (72% of the cell lines) containing the bar-uidA fusion gene expressed gus as compared to cobombarded cell lines (23%) following histological staining. Cw expression ceased after 1 yr in culture for 5% of the cell lines containing the fusion gene and 3% of the cobombarded cell lines. The bifunctionality and utility of the bar-uidA fusion gene were demonstrated, accompanied by enhanced gus expression.

AB Various chimeric sequences of different promoter elements (PEs) fused to gus as the reporter or hpt as the selectable marker were constructed, and their effects on gene expression and selection efficiency were tested following PEG-mediated transformation of Triticum monococcum protoplasts. The Ubi1 showed the highest transient expression level, whereas the 35S promoter was the weakest. The PEs showing stronger transient expression also gave more regenerated GUS(+) colonies 40 days after transformation, which were directly caused by higher levels of stable GUS expression. On the other hand, however, when hpt was used as a selectable marker gene, less difference was observed among these PEs in terms of the number of Hyg(R) colonies that survived. We showed that this disagreement between GUS expression and HPT-mediated selection is most likely caused by post-translational mechanisms, thus indicating that the selection efficiency is not a linear but rather a complex sublinear function of the HPT gene expression efficiency.

AB The present work reports new PCR markers that amplify the complete coding sequence of the specific alleles of the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin genes. A set of AS-PCR molecular markers was designed which use primers from nucleotide sequences of the Glu-A1 and Glu-D1 genes, making use of the minor diffeences between the sequences of the x1, x2* of Glu-A1, and the x5 and y10 of Glu-D1. These primers were able to distinguish between x2* and the x1 or xNull of Glu-A1. Also x5 was distinguishable from x2, and y10 from y12. The primers amplified the complete coding regions and corresponded to the upstream and downstream flanking positions of Glu-A1 and Glu-D1. Primers designed to amplify the Glu-A1 gene amplified a single product when used with genomic DNA of common wheats and the xNull allele of this gene. This work also describes the cloning and characterisation of the nucleotide sequence of this allele. It possesses the same general structure as x2* and x1 (previously determined) and differs from these alleles in the extension of the coding sequence for a presumptive mature protein with only 384 residues. This is due to the presence of a stop codon (TAA) 1215-bp downstream from the start codon. A further stop codon (TAG), 2280-bp downstream from the starting codon is also found. The open reading frame of xNull and x1 alleles has the same size in bp. Both are larger than x2* which shows two small deletions. The reduced size of the presumptive mature protein encoded by xNull could explain the negative effect of this allele on grain quality.

AB A major gene determining non-specific adult-plant disease resistance against stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) designated Yrns-B1 was mapped by using a cross between 'Lgst.79-74' (resistant) and 'Winzi' (susceptible). Analyzing F-3 lines of two consecutive experimental years contrary modes of inheritance were observed due to the intermediate character of the gene and the difference in the disease pressure during the seasons. Using the disease scoring data of both experimental years independently two maps were constructed detecting Yrns-B1 20.5 and 21.7 cM, respectively, proximal to the wheat microsatellite (WMS) marker Xgwm493 on the short arm of chromosome 3BS. The genetic relationships to other major genes or to quantitative trait loci controlling adult plant disease resistance against rusts in wheat are discussed.

AB The leaf rust resistance gene Lr47 confers resistance to a wide spectrum of leaf rust strains. This gene was recently transferred from chromosome 7 S of Triticum speltoides to chromosome 7 A of hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum. To facilitate the transfer of Lr47 to commercial varieties, the completely linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) locus Xabc465 was converted into a PCR-based marker. Barley clone ABC465 is orthologous to the type-I wheat sucrose synthase gene and primers were designed for the conserved regions between the two sequences. These conserved primers were used to amplify, clone and sequence different alleles from T speltoides and T aestivum. This sequence information was then used to identify the T speltoides sequence, detect allele-specific mutations, and design specific primers. Cosegregation of the PCR product of these primers and the T speltoides chromosome segment was confirmed in four backcross-populations. To complement this dominant marker, a cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) was developed for the 7 A allele of Xabc465. This CAPS marker is useful to select homozygous Lr47 plants from F-2, or backcross-F-2 segregating populations, and in combination with the T speltoides-specific primers is expected to facilitate the deployment of Lr47 in new bread wheat varieties.

AB Selecting a promoter for driving transgene expression is one of the most important factors to consider in a transformation project. Information about the native regulation of the promoter activity is important, but it is also necessary to consider how that activity will be affected when integrated into the genome of the transformed plants. Study of a promoter performance in individually transformed lines provides useful information in this area. The maize ubiquitin 1 (Ubi-l) promoter has been widely used to drive constitutive transgene expression in monocotyledonous plants. However, lack of data on its activity in individual transformed wheat lines constitutes a gap in the understanding and predictability of this promoter's performance. In this paper, we began addressing this problem by examining the expression of the marker gene uidA, coding for beta-glucuronidase (GUS), under the control of the maize Ubi-l promoter in individual transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines from different wheat varieties. The expression of uidA driven by this promoter depended to a great extent on the specific transformation event. Whilst expression was strong and constitutive in all tissues in some of the lines analysed, there were also transgenic lines in which GUS activity was restricted to only a few tissues. In general the maize Ubi-l promoter had strong activity in young, metabolically active tissues and in pollen grains.

AB In western Canada, the Bt-10 resistance gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is effective against all the known races of common bunt caused by Tilletia tritici and T. laevis. The genotypes of 199 F-2 plants, originated from a cross between BW553 containing Bt-10 and the susceptible spring wheat cultivar 'Neepawa,' were established in greenhouse and field inoculation studies. A ratio of 1:2:1 resistant : heterozygous : susceptible was observed for bunt reaction, indicating that Bt-10 was expressed in a partially dominant fashion. A polymorphic DNA fragment, amplified using RAPD, and previously shown to be linked to Bt-10 was sequenced and SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) primers devised. However, SCAR primers failed to amplify the polymorphic fragment. Restriction of PCR products with DraI revealed a polymorphic fragment of 490 bp resulting from a single base pair difference between lines possessing Bt-10 and those lacking the gene. As per the base pair difference, FSD and RSA primers were designed to generate a 275-bp polymorphic DNA fragment. Both 275- and 490-bp polymorphic fragments were present in all of the 22 cultivars known to carry Bt-10, and absent in all 16 cultivars lacking Bt-10. A 3:1 ratio was observed for presence: absence of the 275-bp marker in the F-2 population. Using Southern analysis, the 490-bp fragment was effective in differentiating homozygous resistant plants from those heterozygous for Bt-10, based on its presence and the hybridization signal strength. A 1:2:1 resistant : heterozygous : susceptible ratio was also observed for the molecular marker and corresponded to 88% of the phenotypes deduced from the original F-2 population. The molecular marker was estimated to be between 1.1 cM and 6.5 cM away from the Bt-10 resistance gene, based on the segregation analysis. Segregation analyses of Bt-10 and the 275-bp marker, evaluated in three different Canada Prairie Spring (CPS) wheat populations, demonstrated a segregation ratio of 3:1 for the molecular marker in two of the populations. These results demonstrated that the PCR marker system using the FSD and RSA primer pair permitted a rapid and reliable identification of individual lines carrying the Bt-10 gene for resistance to common bunt.

AB Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers with a total of 256 EcoRI + ANN- MseI + CNN primer combinations were investigated employing the common wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum 'Chinese Spring.' On average, 103 fragments per primer combination were amplified, ranging from a maximum of 226 fragments to a minimum of 18 fragments. The primer combinations E + AAA - M + CNN and E + ATT - M + CNN produced very few distinct fragments. By using 15 randomly chosen EcoRI + ANN - MseI + CNN primer combinations, 928 AFLP markers were allocated to wheat chromosomes, of which 131 were assigned to specific chromosome arms. These AFLP markers were locus-specific and randomly distributed on the different chromosomes. In addition, 6 and 41 AFLP markers were simultaneously absent in two nulli-tetrasomics (NTs) of both homoeologous and non-homoeologous groups, respectively, whereas additional fragments were detected in N1BT1A, N5AT5D, and N6BT6A lines.

AB The detection of bacteria in environmental samples using genetic markers is valuable in microbial ecology. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene was studied under nutrient starvation conditions at 4 degrees C, 23 degrees C and 30 degrees C in Pseudomonas fluorescens R2fG1 cells tagged with a red-shifted gfp. Fluorescence intensity was not significantly different in cells maintained in a buffer for at least 48 days at all the tested temperatures. gfp-Tagged R2fG1 cells were introduced into bulk soil microcosms and soil microcosms with wheat seedlings. GFP-marked cells were enumerated immediately after inoculation into soil and again in soil and root samples after 10 days. Counts of culturable colonies were obtained from drop plates using 5-mu l aliquots of serial dilutions viewed with an epifluorescent microscope. Traditional spread plates (using 100-mu l aliquots) and the most-probable-number (MPN) method using a spectrofluorometer were also used to enumerate the GFP-marked Pseudomonas cells in soil, rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples. Microcolonies were visualized on root surfaces under the epifluorescent microscope after immobilizing in agar and incubation for 24 h. Counts from traditional spread plates were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the population estimates of the MPN method for all treatments at any sampling time. Counts using the drop plate method, however, were not significantly different (P < 0.05) except in one treatment, and provided similar estimates in half the time of spread plates and at an estimated third of the cost.

AB Flour colour is an important quality trait in the production of bread, noodles and other related end products. Current screening for flour colour in breeding programs requires several grams of flour to be milled. In order to screen large numbers of plants, a rapid PCR-based assay is required. We report here the conversion of a codominant AFLP marker linked to a major locus controlling flour colour in hexaploid wheat, to a sequence tagged site (STS) marker for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). The two-allelic AFLP bands were cloned and sequenced to allow specific primers to be designed. The primers amplified bands of the expected size in the parental varieties and co-segregated with the original AFLP marker in the mapping population. The primers also amplified alleles of the expected size from the DNA of parental lines of two other related mapping populations. Cultivars that contributed to the pedigree of the original parent 'Schomburgk' used to generate the mapping population were also screened to determine the origin of the 'yellow' allele.

AB Locating of important agronomic genes onto chromosome is helpful for efficient development of new wheat varieties. Wheat chromosome substitution lines between two varieties have been widely used for locating genes because of their distinctive advantages in genetic analysis, compared with the aneuploid genetic materials. Apart from the substituted chromosome, the other chromosomes between the substitution lines and their recipient parent should be identical, which eases the gene locating practice. In this study, a set of chromosome substitution lines with cv. Wichita (WI) as the recipient parent and cv. Cheyenne (CNN) as the donor parent were studied for the composition of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) as well as a range of agronomic important traits. Results revealed that the substitution lines of WI(CNN5D), WI(CNN6A) and WI(CNN7B) had higher plant heights than the two parents of WI and CNN, and WI(CNN3D) had later maturity than the parents. By sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis, a substitution line WI(CNN5B) was found to contain different HMW-GS patterns from its two parents, in which 1By9 was replaced by 1By8 on chromosome 1BL. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis confirmed that the variation on 1BL in WI(CNN5B) was originated from Chinese Spring (CS). It is concluded that chromosomal fragments from bridge material and donor parent were quite often retained in intracultivaral chromosome substitution lines except the substituting chromosomes.

AB Wheat leaf rust is a destructive foliar disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The most effective, economical s to control the disease is growing resistant cultivars with adult plant resistance (APR). The Chinese wheat lines W014204 and Fuyu 3 showed high leaf rust resistance in the field. To identify leaf rust APR genes in the two lines, two mapping populations with 215 and 163 F-2:3 lines from the crosses W014204/Zhengzhou 5389 and Fuyu 3/Zhengzhou 5389, respectively, were phenotyped for leaf rust severities during the 2010-2011, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 cropping seasons in the field at Baoding, Hebei Province, China. A total of 1 215 SSR markers were used to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for leaf rust APR in the two populations. In the W014204/Zhengzhou 5389 population, three QTLs were detected and designated as QLr.hbu-1BL.1, QLr.hbu-2BS.1 and QLr.hbu-7DS, and explained 2.9-8.4, 11.5-38.3 and 8.5-44.5% of the phenotypic variance, respectively; all the resistance alleles at these loci were derived from W014204. In the Fuyu 3/Zhengzhou 5389 population, three QTLs, QLr.hbu-1BL.2, QLr.hbu-2BS.2 and QLr.hbu-7BL, explained 12.0-19.2, 22.3-38.9 and 4.1-4.3% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, and all resistance alleles were contributed by Fuyu 3. Based on chromosome positions of closely linked markers, both QLr.hbu-1BL.1 and QLr.hbu-1BL.2 are Lr46, and QLr.hbu-7DS is Lr34. QLr.hbu-7BL was mapped on chromosome 7BL near to Lr68 and they are likely the same gene. Based on chromosome positions, pedigree and field reactions, the two 2BS QTLs are different from all the known APR genes and are likely to be new APR QTL for leaf rust. These QTLs and their closely linked markers are potentially useful for improving leaf rust resistance in wheat breeding.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikss. (Pst), is an important foliar disease of soft red winter wheat (SRWW) (Triticum aestivum L.) in the eastern United States. However, very few resistance genes have been characterized in the SRWW germplasm pool. The SRWW line VA96W-270 is known to be resistant to stripe rust race PST-100, which was the predominant race in the United States from 2003 to 2006. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross between VA96W-270 and the susceptible cultivar Coker 9835 was evaluated for response to stripe rust infection in inoculated field nurseries over a 3-yr period. The RIL population was then genotyped with stripe rust-linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified, located on chromosomes 3BS and 4BL, both contributed by VA96W-270. The 3BS and 4BL QTL explained up to 28 and 25% of the phenotypic variation for area under disease pressure curve (AUDPC), respectively. Recombinant inbred lines containing both QTL had average disease severity of 6%, compared with 38 to 45% for lines containing one of the two QTL and 69% for those containing neither QTL. Based on susceptibility of VA96W-270 to infection at the seedling stage, the two genes appear to be associated with adult-plant resistance. Markers associated with the two QTL were polymorphic in various wheat genotypes, suggesting they could be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) to develop wheat cultivars with improved stripe rust resistance.

AB Array- or chip-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are widely used in genomic studies because of their abundance in a genome and lower cost per data point than older marker technologies. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), a relatively newer approach of genotyping, suggests equal appeal because of its lesser cost per data point and the avoidance of ascertainment bias during genotyping. In this study, we compared the results from quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, marker distribution on linkage maps, genome size, recombination sites covered by the markers, and cost per polymorphic marker, as well as the methodology and workflow between the Illumina Infinium 9000 SNP-chip genotyping with GBS. Results indicate that while GBS offers similar genome coverage at almost one-fourth the cost of SNP chip, the SNP-chip method is less demanding of computational skills and resources. Eight and nine QTL were detected in the GBS and SNP-chip datasets, respectively, with one QTL common between the systems. Additionally, imputation accuracy of the GBS dataset was examined by introducing missing values randomly and imputing the missing alleles using a probabilistic principal components algorithm. Imputation results suggest recovery of the missing alleles with reasonable accuracy in datasets with low (up to 40%) amount of missing data is possible and can provide acceptable accuracy in gene mapping. Overall, the comparative results indicate that both approaches provide good genome coverage and similar mapping results. The choice of the genotyping platform is decided by the nature of the study and available resources.

AB We investigated alleles at 31 loci associated with adaptability, yield, and end-use quality in 107 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landraces (WLRs) and 121 improved historical wheat cultivars (HWCs) from Pakistan. The WLRs were categorized into two further subgroups: 36 pre-Green-Revolution landraces released as cultivars and 71 geographically spread landraces from all over Pakistan. Alleles VrnA1a, TaGW2-6A-A, TaCKX6-D1b, Pinb-D1b, Psy-A1b, and Wx-D1b were absent in WLRs, whereas ample diversity was observed at all other loci. In HWCs, only Wx-D1b and Glu-A3e were absent among the alleles tested, whereas the alleles Ppd-D1a (90%), Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b (83.4%), TaCwi-A1a (95%), TaGW2-6A-G (76%), TaCKX6-D1a (77.3%), Glu-A1b (66.1%), Glu-D1d (61.3%), Pina-D1b (88.2%), Pinb-D1a (90%), Psy-A1a (66.1%), Psy-B1b (81.8%), Psy-D1a (86.5%), Ppo-A1a (70%), TaZds-D1b (73.9%), TaLox-B1b (80.1%), and Wx-D1a (100%) predominated, indicating significant improvement in adaptability, yield potential, and end-use quality and unconscious selection for favored alleles. Higher frequencies of favored alleles at the TaCwi-A1 and TaCKX6-D1 loci influencing 1000-kernel weight (TKW) in HWCs indicated that selection pressure on these alleles during breeding successfully contributed to cultivar improvement. Wright's pairwise fixation index (Fst) statistics indicated greater genetic divergence between HWC and WLR collections (0.16) than HWC and WLR cultivars (0.14). Population structure based on functional markers (FMs) using principal component analysis partitioned the germplasm into two distinct groups. High genetic divergence and low admixture between HWCs and WLRs indicated limited use of landraces in wheat breeding in Pakistan. Our results suggested these collections as rich reservoirs of alleles and haplotype combinations that may be useful in future breeding programs.

AB The ditelocentric addition line CS-7EL of the spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) contains the long arm of the chromosome 7E from Thinopyrum elongatum (CS-7EL), which confers high resistance to Fusarium head blight. It is of great interest to breeders to integrate the resistance locus (loci) from Th. elongatum into commercial wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to identify candidate genes expressed from the 7EL chromosome of CS-7EL, to develop 7EL-specific molecular markers, and to validate their usefulness for characterizing recombination between one of the group 7 chromosomes of wheat and Th. elongatum. High-throughput sequencing of Fusarium graminearum-infected and control CS and CS-7EL cDNA libraries was performed using RNA-Seq. A stepwise bioinformatics strategy was applied to assemble the sequences obtained from RNA-Seq and to create a conservative list of candidate genes expressed from the foreign chromosome 7EL. Polymerase chain reaction primer pairs were designed and tested for 135 candidate genes. A total of 48 expressed molecular markers specific for the chromosome 7EL were successfully developed. Screening of progenies from two BC1F2 families from the cross CS-7E(7D) x 2*CSph1b showed that these markers are useful for characterizing recombination events between the chromosomes 7D from wheat and 7E from Th. elongatum.

The 90K Infinium iSelect SNP array was used to screen three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations derived from three crosses, CO 960293-2/'TAM 111'(CT), 'TAM 112'/TAM 111 (TT), and 'Halberd'/'Len' (HL). The objective of this study was to compare and validate the chromosomal locations of mapped SNPs in wheat. A set of 152, 124, and 180 RILs were used in CT, TT, and HL. Among the 91,829 SNPs, 54,258 SNPs were called at least in one mapping population. A set of 5950, 4861, and 8376 SNPs were mapped onto chromosomes of CT, TT, and HL, respectively, with a total of 15,604 unique SNPs. Only 374 SNPs (2.4%) were commonly mapped across three populations, and 3025 SNPs (19.4%) were mapped across all combinations of two of the three populations. The number of uniquely mapped SNPs specific to each population was 3291 (21.1%) in CT, 2418 (15.5%) in TT, and 6224 (40.0%) in HL. With known chromosomal locations of the mapped 40K out of 90K array SNPs, linkage groups in all three mapping populations were assigned onto chromosomes. More than 76% of the mapped SNPs have consistent chromosomal locations with the previously mapped 40K SNPs. A set of 2190 (14.0%) unique newly mapped SNPs and 1316 (8.4%) SNPs mapped onto multiple chromosomes were presented. These chromosome maps are essential for the discoveries of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) of important traits in wheat.

AB Knowledge of the allelic variation and epistatic interaction of vernalization genes is crucial to understanding seasonal growth habit and adaptability of genetic resources in cultivated (Hordeum vulgare) and wild (Hodeum spontaneum) barley. In this research, 1398 Chinese barley accessions were characterized with molecular markers for vernalization genes HvVRN1 and HvVRN2. Different combinations of haplotypes at these two vernalization genes were present at different frequencies in wild barley, landraces and modern cultivars. All of the HvVRN1 haplotypes except HvVRN1-7 (V1-7) and HvVRN1-Hs (V1-Hs) were identified in the Chinese barley collection chosen for this study. Haplotype V1-8 occurred at the highest frequency in spring V-1 alleles, and V1-1, V1-4 and V1-8 had broad geographic distributions in China. Haplotypes V1-2 and V1-3 are restricted to modern cultivars as they were introduced from exotic germplasm. A total of 18 HvVRN1/HvVRN2 multilocus haplotypes were identified. Most of the HvVRN1/HvVRN2 haplotypes were present in materials from the Yellow-Huai River Valley and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valley ecological zones, birthplace of Chinese farming. The predominant combinations in landraces were V1-8/V-2 and v(1)/V-2, but v(1)/v(2) made up the highest proportion of modern cultivars. Haplotypes V1-5/v(2), V1-10/V-2 and V1-9/V-2 showed a correlation with region. Our results confirmed the presence or absence of conserved regulatory elements and the length of the first intron of HvVRN1 plays a determinant role in the vernalization requirement of barley. This study provides useful information for breeding and utilization of Chinese barley germplasm.

AB The TGW6 gene encodes a novel indole-3-acetic acid-glucose hydrolase and plays a significant role in improving thousand grain weight (TGW) and yield in rice. In the current study, a TGW6 ortholog from bread wheat chromosome 3AL was isolated and designated as TaTGW6-A1. Sequencing and alignment analysis showed that the cloned TaTGW6-A1 consists of a 987-bp intronless open reading frame. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified between cultivars with higher and lower TGW, forming two haplotypes, TaTGW6-A1a and TaTGW6-A1b. A derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker, TaTGW6-A1-CAPS, was developed to differentiate the two haplotypes. Linkage analysis using the wheat 90K iSelect SNP array mapped TaTGW6-A1-CAPS at 18 cM from BobWhite_c47304_56 in a RIL population derived from Zhou 8425B/Chinese Spring. A QTL for yield at the TaTGW6-A1 locus explained 17.4 % of the phenotypic variance in average yield over four environments. Association analysis on 242 Chinese and foreign cultivars indicated that TaTGW6-A1 was significantly associated with TGW. The cumulative frequency of the TaTGW6-A1a allele associated with higher TGW was approximately 80 %, indicating that the TaTGW6-A1a allele was positively selected in wheat breeding. In conclusion, TaTGW6-A1 in conjunction with its molecular marker may contribute as a valuable gene in improving yield potential in wheat.

AB This study reports the inheritance and genetic mapping of the YrA (temporary name of convenience to describe the specificity) seedling resistance to wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) in a resistant selection of the Australian cv. Avocet [Avocet R (AvR)-AUS 90660]. Genetic analysis was performed on F-2 populations and F-3 generation families from crosses between wheats that carried and lacked the YrA resistance. Greenhouse seedling tests with two avirulent Pst pathotypes (104 E137 A- and 108 E141 A-) confirmed that the YrA resistance was inherited as two complementary dominant genes. Ninety-two doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross between the Australian cv. Teal (Pst susceptible) and AvR were used for DArT-Seq genotypic analysis to map the seedling resistance. Marker-trait association analysis using 9035 DArT-Seq loci mapped the genes to the long arms of chromosomes 3D (3DL) and 5B (5BL), respectively. F-2 populations from crosses between susceptible DH lines that carried either the 3DL or 5BL marker genotypes confirmed the complementary gene model. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis determined that Teal carries a reciprocal T5B-7B translocation. FISH analysis also identified a 5BL chromosomal deletion in Avocet S relative to AvR that further validated the complementary gene model and possibly explained the heterogeneity of closely related wheats carrying the YrA resistance. The individual loci of the complementary YrA resistance were designated Yr73 (3DL) and Yr74 (5BL). Candidate single gene reference stocks will be permanently accessioned following cytological analysis to avoid the T5B-7B translocation.

AB Earliness per se (Eps) genes account for the variation in flowering time when vernalization and photoperiod requirements are satisfied. Genomics and bioinformatics approaches were used to describe allelic variation for 40 Triticum aestivum genes predicted, by synteny with Brachypodium distachyon, to be in the 1DL Eps region. Re-sequencing 1DL genes revealed that varieties carrying early heading alleles at this locus, Spark and Cadenza, carry a subtelomeric deletion including several genes. The equivalent region in Rialto and Avalon is intact. A bimodal distribution in the segregating Spark X Rialto single seed descent (SSD) populations enabled the 1DL QTL to be defined as a discrete Mendelian factor, which we named Eps-D1. Near isogenic lines (NILs) and NIL derived key recombinants between markers flanking Eps-D1 suggest that the 1DL deletion contains the gene(s) underlying Eps-D1. The deletion spans the equivalent of the Triticum monoccocum Eps-Am1 locus, and hence includes MODIFIER OF TRANSCRIPTION 1 (MOT1) and FTSH PROTEASE 4 (FTSH4), the candidates for Eps-Am1. The deletion also contains T. aestivum EARLY FLOWERING 3-D1 (TaELF3-D1) a homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock gene EARLY FLOWERING 3. Eps-D1 is possibly a homologue of Eps-B1 on chromosome 1BL. NILs carrying the Eps-D1 deletion have significantly reduced total TaELF3 expression and altered TaGIGANTEA (TaGI) expression compared with wild type. Altered TaGI expression is consistent with an ELF3 mutant, hence we propose TaELF3-D1 as the more likely candidate for Eps-D1. This is the first direct fine mapping of Eps effect in bread wheat.

AB Russian wheat aphid (RWA; Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov) and wheat rusts (stem rust [caused by Puccinia graminis Pers.: Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.], leaf rust [caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.], and stripe rust [caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks.]) are major constraints to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. We aimed to combine resistance to these four biotic constraints in ` Kariega', a South African spring wheat cultivar. Five spring wheat lines, SA16486 (Reg. No. GP-990, PI 674173), SA16487 (Reg. No. GP-991, PI 674174), SA16488 (Reg. No. GP-992, PI 674175), SA16490 (Reg. No. GP-993, PI 674176), and SA16491 (Reg. No. GP-994, PI 674177) were developed by the Agricultural Research Council-Small Grain Institute, South Africa, and released in 2015. These F-3:6 lines are descended from a top-cross made in 2001 between two backcrossed lines, one with RWA resistance from PI 225227 (resistant to biotypes RWASA1, RWASA2, and RWASA3) and another with Sr35 (resistant to the Ug99 race group). Phenotypic screening for RWA resistance (using biotype RWASA1) and marker assisted selection for rust resistance genes including Sr35, Lr34/Yr18/Sr57/Pm38/Sb1/Ltn1, and QYr. sgi-2B. 1 were used to identify the targeted traits during selection. The unique combination of aphid and rust resistance, medium to high yield potential, and good end-use quality makes these wheat lines useful for wheat breeders with an interest in these resistance traits.

AB Many studies have highlighted the continuously increasing need for genetic diversity in the field; nonetheless, plant breeding is still predominantly generating uniform cultivars. Evolutionary plant breeding offers the possibility of reconciling agro-biodiversity, high yields and adaptation to climate change. However, the diversity that can be conserved in heterogeneous populations, its evolution and the potential of 'evolutionary breeding' in the actual scenario of climate change is still a matter of debate. In the present study, a total of 147 barley individuals, 56 from seven parental populations (PPs) and 91 from the composite cross-derived population (CCP) resulting from their inter-crossing were genotyped at 22 Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) loci with the objective of obtaining insights into how genetic diversity evolved in the field during 13 years of multiplication. A total of 92 different alleles were detected in the PP and 100 in the CCP. Results showed that the composite individuals are grouped into five major clusters differing for both the number of individuals and the relative level of genetic diversity. The mean values of the most common descriptors of genetic diversity were not significantly different between the parental and the composite populations. However, analysis of molecular variance showed some degree of differentiation between the two populations suggesting that evolution occurred during the years of multiplication and selection effects were detected for some loci. The SSR loci detected as putatively under selection in the present study have already been reported as co-localized with quantitative trait loci for adaptedness traits or tagging genes related to abiotic stress response. According to the current results, evolving crop populations, which have the capability of adapting to the conditions under which they are grown, can be useful in conserving genetic diversity and as sources of genes for breeding purposes in particular in the actual scenario of climate change.

AB Fusarium graminearum is the primary causal agent of Fusarium head blight of wheat in Argentina. This disease affects yield losses and quality of grains, reducing the wheat end-use, also causing mycotoxin contamination. In this study, the genetic variability and deoxynivalenol (DON) potential/production of F. graminearum sensu stricto (s.s.) isolates obtained from wheat samples of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 growing seasons from a single location in Argentina were evaluated. The genetic variability detected using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) was analyzed in relation to the in vitro deoxynivalenol production, the main monitored and quantified mycotoxin according to the current regulations for the international marketing of cereals. Of the 68 F. graminearum s.s. isolates obtained in this study, 95 % showed a different banding pattern with ISSR molecular markers and a high variability was detected within the population. However, no clustering was found in relation with year or DON production. All isolates amplify for the DON-related gene and a high variability in DON production was observed among the isolates, with production values between non-producers and 1741 mu g/g. The results suggest that the F. graminearum s.s. population varies significantly in both genetic structure and toxin production in a limited sampled area.

AB Aneuploidy causes changes in gene expression and phenotypes in all organisms studied. A previous study in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that aneuploidy-generated phenotypic changes can be inherited to euploid progenies and implicated an epigenetic underpinning of the heritable variations.
   Based on an analysis by amplified fragment length polymorphism and methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, we found that although genetic changes at the nucleotide sequence level were negligible, extensive changes in cytosine DNA methylation patterns occurred in all studied homeologous group 1 whole-chromosome aneuploid lines of common wheat (Triticum aestivum), with monosomic 1A showing the greatest amount of methylation changes. The changed methylation patterns were inherited by euploid progenies derived from the aneuploid parents. The aneuploidy-induced DNA methylation alterations and their heritability were verified at selected loci by bisulfite sequencing.
   Our data have provided empirical evidence supporting earlier suggestions that heritability of aneuploidy-generated, but aneuploidy-independent, phenotypic variations may have an epigenetic basis.
   That at least one type of aneuploidy - monosomic 1A - was able to cause significant epigenetic divergence of the aneuploid plants and their euploid progenies also lends support to recent suggestions that aneuploidy may have played an important and protracted role in polyploid genome evolution.

AB Wild Cicer species are known to be more responsive to vernalization (induce early flowering when exposed to low temperatures) than the cultivated chickpea. This study was aimed at molecular mapping of vernalization response quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in chickpea. An interspecific recombinant inbred line (RIL) population [ICC 4958 (Cicer arietinum) x PI 489777 (Cicer reticulatum)] was phenotyped for vernalization response for two consecutive years (2009-2010 and 2010-2011) under field conditions. A linkage map already available for this population was used for QTL analysis. A major QTL contributing 55 % of phenotypic variation for vernalization response trait was identified on LG 3 at LOD score of 27. The simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers TA64 and CaM1515 were flanking the QTL which spans a distance of 22 cM. Six Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-end sequence derived SSRs (CaM0717, CaM2086, CaM1760, CaM1364, CaM1122, and CaM0886) are present in this QTL region and can be used for isolation of vernalization response genes. Among 84 flowering related genes present in this region, Ca_06280 related to MADS box genes, was reported to play important role in vernalization in cereals. Understanding the genetic control of vernalization response in chickpea will help in exploitation of wild Cicer species in chickpea improvement.

AB Triticale (xTriticosecale Wittm) is an economically important crop for fodder and biomass production. To facilitate the identification of markers for agronomically important traits and for genetic and genomic characteristics of this species, a new high-density genetic linkage map of triticale was constructed using doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between cultivars 'Hewo' and 'Magnat'. The map consists of 1615 bin markers, that represent 50 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 842 diversity array technology (DArT), and 16888 DArTseq markers mapped onto 20 linkage groups assigned to the A, B, and R genomes of triticale. No markers specific to chromosome 7R were found, instead mosaic linkage group composed of 1880 highly distorted markers (116 bins) from 10 wheat chromosomes was identified. The genetic map covers 4907 cM with a mean distance between two bins of 3.0 cM. Comparative analysis in respect to published maps of wheat, rye and triticale revealed possible deletions in chromosomes 4B, 5A, and 6A, as well as inversion in chromosome 7B. The number of bin markers in each chromosome varied from 24 in chromosome 3R to 147 in chromosome 6R. The length of individual chromosomes ranged between 50.7 cM for chromosome 2R and 386.2 cM for chromosome 7B. A total of 512 (31.7%) bin markers showed significant (P < 0.05) segregation distortion across all chromosomes. The number of 8 the segregation distorted regions (SDRs) were identified on 1A, 7A, 1B, 2B, 7B (2 SDRs), 5R and 6R chromosomes. The high-density genetic map of triticale will facilitate fine mapping of quantitative trait loci, the identification of candidate genes and map-based cloning.

AB Background: Pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) is an economically important crop belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. However, very few genomic and genetic resources are available for this species. As part of our ongoing efforts to sequence the pumpkin genome, high-density genetic map is essential for anchoring and orienting the assembled scaffolds. In addition, a saturated genetic map can facilitate quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.
   Results: A set of 186 F-2 plants derived from the cross of pumpkin inbred lines Rimu and SQ026 were genotyped using the genotyping-by-sequencing approach. Using the SNPs we identified, a high-density genetic map containing 458 bin-markers was constructed, spanning a total genetic distance of 2,566.8 cM across the 20 linkage groups of C. maxima with a mean marker density of 5.60 cM. Using this map we were able to anchor 58 assembled scaffolds that covered about 194.5 Mb (71.7 %) of the 271.4 Mb assembled pumpkin genome, of which 44 (183.0 Mb; 67.4 %) were oriented. Furthermore, the high-density genetic map was used to identify genomic regions highly associated with an important agronomic trait, dwarf vine. Three QTLs on linkage groups (LGs) 1, 3 and 4, respectively, were recovered. One QTL, qCmB2, which was located in an interval of 0.42 Mb on LG 3, explained 21.4 % phenotypic variations. Within qCmB2, one gene, Cma_004516, encoding the gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase in the GA biosynthesis pathway, had a 1249-bp deletion in its promoter in bush type lines, and its expression level was significantly increased during the vine growth and higher in vine type lines than bush type lines, supporting Cma_004516 as a possible candidate gene controlling vine growth in pumpkin.
   Conclusions: A high-density pumpkin genetic map was constructed, which was used to successfully anchor and orient the assembled genome scaffolds, and to identify QTLs highly associated with pumpkin vine length. The map provided a valuable resource for gene cloning and marker assisted breeding in pumpkin and other related species. The identified vine length QTLs would help to dissect the underlying molecular basis regulating pumpkin vine growth.

AB Plant height is an important agronomic trait in cereal crops, and can affect both plant architecture and grain yield. New dwarfing genes are required for improving the genetic diversity of wheat. In this study, a novel dwarf mutant, NM9, was created by treating seeds of the wheat variety NAU9918 with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). NM9 showed obvious phenotypic changes, which were distinct from those caused by other dwarfing genes, especially the reduced plant height, increased effective tiller number, and elongated spike and grain length. The reduced plant height in NM9 was attributable to a semi-dominant dwarfing gene Rht_NM9, which was flanked by two closely linked SNP markers, SNP34 and SNP41, covering an 8.86-Mb region on the chromosome arm 2AS. The results of gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity evaluation, comparative genomics analysis and allelism test indicated that Rht_NM9 was neither allelic to Rht7 and Rht21 nor homoeoallelic to Rht8, so Rht_NM9 was proposed to be a new dwarfing locus on the homoeologous group 2 chromosomes of wheat. Rht_NM9 has a negative effect on plant height and positive effects on effective tiller number and grain size, thus, Rht_NM9 could be used for elucidating the mechanisms underlying plant architecture and grain development.

AB Heat stress is a critical challenge to tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in many areas of the globe and variations in genetic structure and functional traits is for the efficient breeding programs on developing heat tolerant cultivars. Tolerant-related morpho-physiological traits and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were employed to survey genetic diversity in greenhouse and growth chamber trials. 100 tall fescue accessions, including 8 commercial cultivars and 92 natural genotypes, showed a high variation in phenotypic performance under heat stress. Based on standardized heat tolerant-related morpho-physiological data, all tall fescue accessions were clustered into five groups. The accessions with similar heat tolerance were likely to be clustered in the same group. The highest genetic diversity was obtained for accessions from Africa judged by Nei's gene diversity (0.2640) and PIC (0.2112). All grass accessions could be divided into three major groups based on SSR markers, which was partially congruous to the geographical regions and history of introduction. A low correlation was found between morpho-physiological traits and SSR markers by Mantel test. The patterns in morphophysiological trait variations and genetic diversity associated with heat tolerance were useful to design breeding programs for developing heat stress resistance in tall fescue.

AB Cytokinin oxidase (CKX) plays a crucial role in plant growth and development by reversibly inactivating cytokinin (CTK). Twenty-four primer pairs, designed from ESTs of the TaCKX genes family of common wheat, were used to identify their allelic variations associated with grain size, weight, and filling rate in 169 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from Jing 411 x Hongmangchun 21. TaCKX6a02, a member of TaCKX gene family, amplified by primer pair T31-32, showed a close association with grain traits in this RIL population. Statistical analysis indicated that allelic variation of TaCKX6a02 had significant correlation with grain size, weight, and filling rate (GFR; P < 0.001) under varied environments. The TaCKX6a02-D1a allele from Jing411 significantly increased grain size, weight and grain filling rate, compared with TaCKX6a02-D1b from Hongmangchun 21. TaCKX6a02 was located on chromosome 3DS in the interval of Xbarc1119 and Xbarc1162, with a genetic distance of 1.4 cM. The location was further confirmed using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines. A major QTL (quantitative trait locus) tightly linked to TaCKX6a02 was detected in the RIL population, explaining 17.1 similar to 38.2% of phenotype variations for grain size, weight, GFRmax and GFRmean in different environments. In addition, significant effects of variations of TaCKX6a02 on grain weight and GFR were further validated by association analysis among 102 wheat varieties in two cropping seasons. 12.8 similar to 35.1% of phenotypic variations were estimated for these genotypes. A novel 29-bp InDel behind the stop codon was detected by DNA sequence analysis between the two alleles of TaCKX6a02-D1. The gene-specific marker, TKX3D, was designed according to the novel variation, and can be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for grain size, weight, and GFR in common wheat.

AB Aim. The current study was aimed to evaluate the winter wheat lines for its potential of vernalization in semitemperate conditions. Besides, allelic variation of vernalization (VRN-1) gene at promoter region was also analyzed.
   Methods. Analysis of variance and Pearson correlation were applied to investigate the relationship between grain yield and agronomic traits. Genotypes were analyzed with PCR-based VRN-1 gene and allele-specific markers to investigate the likely presence or absence and allelic variation of VRN-1 gene.
   Results. It was found that tillers (TLL) and plant height (PH) were positively correlated with yield, while flag leaf sheath (FLS), awn length (AL), flag leaf area (FLA) and peduncle length (PL) were less positively correlated with yield. Similarly, stem diameter (SD), dry biomass (DB), lodging (LOD) and grain weight (GW) were negatively correlated with yield. Intron-1 deletion associated with spring growth habit was observed at the VRN-B1 loci of VRN-1 gene in four wheat genotypes (WWline16, WWline42, WWline56, and WWline107). No intronic deletions were observed at the VRN-1 loci of either genome in three wheat genotypes (WWline46, WWline75 and WWline109) and thus followed winter growth habit.
   Conclusion. Correlation analysis of traits and molecular evaluation of lines will help architecting wheat genotypes suitable for the temperate and semi temperate conditions.

AB Analysis of structural changes of octoploid triticale genomes was conducted in F-2 and F-3 generations. The plants were derived from crosses of five cultivars and breeding lines of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with one cultivar of rye (Secale cereale L). The study used four marker systems: inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP), retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP), and a technique named inter-transposon amplified polymorphism (ITAP) developed by the authors. Most frequently, elimination of specific bands was observed, especially of rye bands. Depending on the cross combination, the percentage of eliminated rye bands ranged from 73.6 to 80.6 %. A lower percentage of wheat bands was eliminated, i.e., from 57.6 to 76.48 %, depending on the combination of crosses. The emergence of new types of bands in hybrids absent in the parental forms was the rarest phenomenon (14.5 - 17.9 %). The results indicate the ongoing process of genome rearrangements at the molecular level in the early generations of plant crosses that also involve repeated nucleotide sequences of DNA.

AB Wheat grain high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are the major determinants of dough elasticity and viscosity, and thus of breadmaking quality. Most known HMW-GS genes in bread wheat have been already cloned except for very few such as 1By18 and 1By19. In this study, HMW-GS 1By18 gene was isolated from bread wheat for the first time. In the past, this subunit has been considered to have positive effect on gluten quality. Molecular characterization of the 1By18 subunit gene showed that its complete coding nucleotide sequence was 2163 bp long, being highly identical to 1By8, with only three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at sites 231, 233 and 1976 of the coding sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of 1By18 exhibited two substitutions compared to 1By8. The deduced protein was further verified by expression in E. coli and LC-MS/MS analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 1By18 was more closely related to 1By8, 1By9 and 1By16 than to 1By15 and 1By20. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Glu-Bli allele emerged after the formation of modern hexaploid wheat. Two sets of SNP-based AS-PCR markers for 1By18 gene were developed and validated on 110 bread wheat varieties with different Glu-Bly alleles, and five recombinant inbred lines. Both markers could effectively distinguish 1By18 from the other genes at the Glu-B1 locus, thus making them valuable for marker-assisted selection in wheat quality improvement programs.

AB Aegilops sharonensis is a diploid relative of wheat and has novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) encoded by Glu-1S(sh). Hybrids of tetraploid wheat species and Ae. sharonensis have been successfully created by wild crosses. In our study, we conducted backcrosses and introduced the novel HMW-GSs of Ae. sharonensis into hexaploid wheat species. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cytogenetics indicated that lines carrying the HMW-GSs encoded by Glu-1S(sh) had varied chromosome numbers ranging from 35 to 50. Among these, three lines with 42 chromosomes (25-8, 33-1, and 42-2) were identified by visual examination. Except for possessing the alien HMW-GSs of Ae. sharonensis, the agricultural traits of the three lines were similar to those of common wheat, indicating their potential for wheat breeding. Additionally, we developed two molecular markers specific to the x-and y-type HMW-GSs genes of Ae. sharonensis. These two molecular markers were validated in backcross progenies and were proven to accurately trace and distinguish Ae. sharonensis Glu-1S(sh) from Glu-1A, Glu-1B, and Glu-1D of wheat. Therefore, the Glu-1S(sh) HMW-GSs lines with 42 chromosomes, together with gene-specific markers, will be valuable for molecular-assisted selection in alien genes utilization and wheat breeding.

AB There is worldwide interest in adult plant resistance (APR) because of greater durability of APR to the cereal rusts. Peruvian bread wheat genotype 'CPAN (Coordinated Project Accession Number) 1842' (LM 50-53) has shown leaf rust resistance in disease screening nurseries since its introduction in 1977. However, it is susceptible at the seedling stage to several Puccinia triticina (Pt) pathotypes including the widely prevalent 77-5 (121R63-1) that infects bread wheat. Inheritance studies showed that CPAN 1842 carried a dominant gene for APR to pathotype 77-5, which was different from Lr12, Lr13, Lr22a, Lr34, Lr35, Lr37, Lr46, Lr48, Lr49 and Lr68, based on the tests of allelism; and from Lr67, based on genotyping with the closely linked SSR marker cfd71. This gene should also be different from Lr22b as the latter is totally ineffective against pathotype 77-5. CPAN 1842 therefore appears to be a new promising source of leaf rust resistance. Also having resistance to stem rust and stripe rust, this line can contribute to breeding for multiple rust resistances in wheat.

AB The slow-rusting and mildewing gene Yr18/Lr34/Pm38/Sr57 confers partial, durable resistance to multiple fungal pathogens and has its origins in China. A number of diagnostic markers were developed for this gene based on the gene sequence, but these markers do not always predict the presence of the resistant phenotype as some wheat varieties with the gene are susceptible to stripe rust in China. We hypothesized that these varieties have a suppressor of Yr18. This study was undertaken to determine the presence of Yr18, the suppressor and/or another resistance gene in 144 Chinese wheat landraces using molecular markers and stripe rust field data. Forty-three landraces were predicted to have Yr18 based on the presence of the markers, but had final disease severities higher than 70%, indicating that this gene may be under the influence of a suppressor. Four of these landraces, 'Sichuanyonggang 2', 'Baikemai', 'Youmai' and 'Zhangsihuang', were chosen for genetic studies. Crosses were made between the lines and 'Avocet S', with further crosses of Sichuanyonggang 2 9 'Huixianhong' and Sichuanyonggang 2 9 'Chinese Spring'. The F-1 plants of Sichuanyonggang 2/Chinese Spring was susceptible indicating the presence of a dominant suppressor gene. The results of genetic analyses of F-2:3 and BC1F2 families derived from these crosses indicated the presence of Yr18, a Yr18 suppressor and another additive resistance gene. The Yr18 region in Sichuanyonggang 2 was sequenced to ensure that it contained the functional allele. This is the first report of a suppressor of Yr18/Lr34/Pm38/Sr57 gene with respect to stripe rust response.

AB Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) is extensively cultivated in Japan, Korea, China, and Russia and is harvested for timber, pulpwood, garden, and paper markets. However, genetic information and molecular markers were very scarce for this species. In this study, over 51 million sequencing clean reads from P. densiflora mRNA were produced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. It yielded 83,913 unigenes with a mean length of 751 bp, of which 54,530 (64.98%) unigenes showed similarity to sequences in the NCBI database. Among which the best matches in the NCBI Nr database were Picea sitchensis (41.60%), Amborella trichopoda (9.83%), and Pinus taeda (4.15%). A total of 1953 putative microsatellites were identified in 1784 unigenes using MISA (MicroSAtellite) software, of which the tri-nucleotide repeats were most abundant (50.18%) and 629 EST-SSR (expressed sequence tag- simple sequence repeats) primer pairs were successfully designed. Among 20 EST-SSR primer pairs randomly chosen, 17 markers yielded amplification products of the expected size in P. densiflora. Our results will provide a valuable resource for gene-function analysis, germplasm identification, molecular marker-assisted breeding and resistance-related gene(s) mapping for pine for P. densiflora.

AB Blast, caused by Pyricularia oryzae, is one of the major diseases of wheat in South America. We identified a new gene for resistance to Triticum isolates of P. oryzae in common wheat 'S-615', and designated it "resistance to Magnaporthe grisea 8" (Rmg8). Rmg8 was assigned to chromosome 2B through molecular mapping with simple-sequence repeat markers. To identify an avirulence gene corresponding to Rmg8, Triticum isolate Br48 (avirulent on S-615) was crossed with 200R29 (virulent on S-615), an F-1 progeny derived from a cross between an Eleusine isolate (MZ5-1-6) and Br48. Segregation analysis of their progeny revealed that avirulence of Br48 on S-615 was conditioned by a single gene, which was designated AVR-Rmg8. AVR-Rmg8 was closely linked to AVR-Rmg7, which corresponded to Rmg7 located on chromosome 2A of tetraploid wheat.

AB Taxodium 'zhongshansa', an extremely flood-tolerant tree species, has been widely planted in eastern China due to its environmental attributes. Although much progress has been made in understanding its physiological response to flooding stress, as well as its rapid propagation and variety selection, little is known regarding its molecular genetics due primarily to a lack of reliable molecular markers. In this paper, 108,692 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with a total size of 69.3 Mb derived from T. 'zhongshansa' were analyzed. And 10,038 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were identified from 8137 SSR-containing EST sequences. The average SSR frequency in the transcriptome was one in 6.90 kb of EST sequences. The most abundant repeat type was mononucleotide (6581, 65.56 %), followed by trinucleotide (2246, 22.37 %) and dinucleotide (1080, 10.76 %). After filtering unqualified SSR loci, loci with mononucleotide repeats and compound SSRs, 1958 EST-SSR loci were selected to design SSR makers. To validate this set of SSR markers, 503 primer pairs were randomly selected to amplify across 12 genomic DNA templates from three Taxodium species. Two hundred fifty-seven (51.09 %) out of 503 primer pairs amplified the expected products, of which 81 and 176 could amplify polymorphic and monomorphic bands, respectively. The functional categorization of EST sequences containing randomly selected markers revealed that 264 (52.49 %) had homology with known proteins. This set of EST-SSR markers will provide a valuable genetic and genomic tool for further genetic research in Taxodium, such as genetic map construction, quantitative trait loci mapping, and marker assisted selection.

AB Drought is one of the most important environmental factors limiting wheat yield in many parts of the world. Progress in breeding to improve drought tolerance has been limited by its high sensitivity to environmental factors, low heritability, and the complexity and size of wheat genome. Two genetically diverse sets of wheat genotypes were evaluated to identify genetic resources maintaining physiological and metabolic stability under osmotic stress. Data on 13 different morphological and physiological traits under control and osmotic stress clearly depicted the superiority of wheat lines derived from synthetic hexaploid wheats (SHWs) as compared to conventional bread wheats. Accordingly, all lines were genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to assess the diversity and identify the marker-trait associations (MTAs). Structure analysis partitioned the germplasm into two sub-populations (K = 2) based on Delta K and LnP(D) values. Association mapping was performed using Q + K matrix as covariates by applying mixed linear model (MLM). In total, 39 MTAs over 20 SSR loci were detected by the strict MLM model, which were reduced to 12 MTAs over 6 SSR loci after strict Bonferroni adjustments. MTAs detected under osmotic stress conditions indicated the effectiveness of association mapping to identify loci for different attributes under low-moisture conditions. Conclusively, this study has demonstrated that synthetic-derived wheats harbor valuable alleles that can enrich the genetic base of cultivated wheat and improve its adaptation under water stress conditions. The MTAs detected may have the candidate genes responsible for drought adaptation, thus providing a unique resource which can be manipulated for developing drought-tolerant cultivars.

AB A novel Dasypyrum species, Dasypyrum breviaristatum, serves as a valuable source of useful genes for wheat improvement. The development and characterization of new wheatD. breviaristatum introgression lines is important to determine the novel gene(s) on specific chromosome(s). We first used multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify the individual D. breviaristatum V-b chromosomes in a common wheatD. breviaristatum partial amphiploid, TDH-2. The FISH patterns of D. breviaristatum chromosomes were different from those of D. villosum chromosomes. Lines D2146 and D2150 were selected from a cross between wheat line MY11 and wheatD. breviaristatum partial amphiploid TDH-2, and they were characterized by FISH and PCR-based molecular markers. We found that D2150 was a monosomic addition line for chromosome 5V(b) of D. breviaristatum, while D2146 had the 5V(b)L chromosome arm translocated with wheat chromosome 5AS. Molecular marker analysis confirmed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosome 5V(b)L translocation possessed a duplicated region homoeologous to 5AS, revealing that the 5AS.5V(b)L translocation may not functionally compensate well. The dwarfing and the pre-harvest re-growth habits observed in the wheatD. breviaristatum chromosome 5V(b) derivatives may be useful for future development of perennial growth wheat lines.

AB Thinopyrum ponticum is particularly a valuable source of genes for wheat improvement. A novel wheat-Th. ponticum addition line, 1-27, was identified using cytology, SSR, EST-SSR, EST-STS and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) markers in this study. Cytological studies showed that 1-27 contained 44 chromosomes and formed 22 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis indicated that two chromosomes from Th. ponticum had been introduced into 1-27 and that these two chromosomes could form a bivalent in wheat background. Such results demonstrated that 1-27 was a disomic addition line with 42 wheat chromosomes and a pair of Th. ponticum chromosomes. One SSR marker (BARC235), one EST-STS marker (MAG3284) and 8 PLUG markers (TNAC1210, TNAC1787, TNAC1803, TNAC1805, TNAC1806, TNAC1821, TNAC1867 and TNAC1957), which were all from wheat chromosome group 7, produced the specific band in Th. ponticum and 1-27, indicating that the introduced Th. ponticum chromosomes belonging to the group 7 of wheat. Sequence analysis on specific bands from Th. ponticum and 1-27 amplified using the PLUG marker TNAC1867 further confirmed this result. The 1-27 addition line was also observed to be high resistant to powdery mildew though it is not clear if the resistance of 1-27 inherited from Th. ponticum. This study provided some useful information for effective exploitation of the source of genetic variability in wheat breeding.

AB The 1BL/1RS wheat-rye translocations had been used in wheat breeding programs worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the 1BL/1RS translocation in SeriM82 /Babax recombinant population. 167 lines of this population were assayed under well-irrigated, terminal drought, heat and a combination of heat and drought stress conditions in two years. 5S rDNA and Iag95 markers were used to differentiate genotypes with or without the1BL/1RS translocation. Presence of 1BL/1RS translocation reduced grain yield (YLD), grain per spike (GSP) and grain per m(2) (GM2). QTLs in 1 BL/1RS segments indicated increased thousand-grain weight (TGW), chlorophyll content, spikelet per spike (SPLS), spike compactness (SCOM) and awn length (AWL) but reduced YLD, GSP and GM2. The 1BL/1RS carrying lines' response varied between assayed environments. Plants of drought trials were more affected by 1BL/1RS compared to others. Differences in the effects of 1BL/1RS and QTLs suggest that gene expression at translocation loci is restricted to specific environmental conditions. In general, the 1BL/1RS translocation could not be a suitable source of genetic diversity for enhancing grain yield under heat and drought stresses.

AB Pch1 gene translocated from Aegilops ventricosa provides effective resistance to eyespot in wheat. To track the Pch1 gene introgression, we investigated 372 genotypes obtained from various breeding programs using endopeptidase EpD1b marker, sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker XustSSR2001-7DL, and the score of infection index (K-index) evaluated after in vivo inoculation test. These genotypes were divided into three groups with 136, 124 and 112 genotypes for the field test lasting three years. In 2011, the mean K-index was 0.81, while 2012 and 2013 the mean K-indexes were 1.60 and 1.46, respectively. Both marker results indicated that 18 genotypes possessed Pch1 gene. Statistical analysis of the level of K-index showed that these 18 genotypes were resistant to eyespot, which verified the proper assignment of wheat genotypes with Pch1 gene based on the marker data. Thus, the endopeptidase and XustSSR2001-7DL are useful for identifying sources of eyespot resistance gene Pch1 in wheat breeding program.

AB The tiller inhibition (tin) gene is known to reduce the number of tillers in a wheat plant, also leads to the development of 'Gigas' characteristics such as large spikes, thick leaves and stems. The 80 advanced lines with variable number of tillers were screened with a SSR marker (Xgwm136) associated with tin gene. 90 % lines amplified according to the reported banding pattern for tin gene. A nearly perfect co-segregation of the marker and the number of tillers per square meter area was observed suggesting that the marker can be used in the MAS for the number of tillers in wheat.

AB With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become the major type of marker for genotyping in many crops. However, the availability of SNP markers for important traits of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that can be effectively used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) is still limited and SNP assays for MAS are usually uniplex. A shift from uniplex to multiplex assays will allow the simultaneous analysis of multiple markers and increase MAS efficiency. We designed 33 locus-specific markers from SNP or indel-based marker sequences that linked to 20 different quantitative trait loci (QTL) or genes of agronomic importance in wheat and analyzed the amplicon sequences using an Ion Torrent Proton Sequencer and a custom allele detection pipeline to determine the genotypes of 24 selected germplasm accessions. Among the 33 markers, 27 were successfully multiplexed and 23 had 100% SNP call rates. Results from analysis of "kompetitive allele-specific PCR" (KASP) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers developed from the same loci fully verified the genotype calls of 23 markers. The NGS-based multiplexed assay developed in this study is suitable for rapid and high-throughput screening of SNPs and some indel-based markers in wheat.

AB The development of DNA techniques such as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has led to advancements in the field of illegal food product detection. Here, we report a PCR-based method to detect rice grain flour in commercial mixed-flour products. To select the chloroplast genes available for a rice-specific marker, we analyzed chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) polymorphisms in several gene families from five plant species, including rice, adlay, barley, maize, and wheat by using comparative sequence analysis. We found two potential rice-specific marker genes, rpoB and rpoC2, which exhibited relatively high numbers of segregating sites compared to other genes. We designed gene-specific primers for rpoB and rpoC2 on the basis of sequence differences, and identified the appropriate PCR amplification in grain flour samples derived from six Korean rice varieties using the linearity test of the qRT-PCR assay. To test the applicability of these cpDNA markers, we performed a qRT-PCR assay on total DNA obtained from different commercial food products, and successfully detected the rice-specific cpDNA region (rpoB and rpoC2) in several commercial food products that were declared to contain rice. Thus, the reported qRT-PCR assay may prove to be a useful tool for the detection of various rice flours in commercial mixed-flour products such as Sunsik.

AB The identification and characterization of resistance genes effective against stripe rust of wheat is beneficial for modern wheat breeding programs. Molecular markers to such genes facilitate their deployment. The variety Milan has resistance that is effective against the predominant stripe rust races in the Sichuan region. Two resistant and two susceptible F-8 lines from a cross between Milan and the susceptible variety Chuannong 16 were used to investigate inheritance of the Milan resistance. Three F-2 populations were developed from crosses between the resistant lines and their susceptible sibling lines (LM168a x LM168c, LM168c x LM168a, LM168b x LM168d) and used for genetic analysis and molecular mapping of the genes for resistance. The stripe rust resistance in LM168a and LM168b was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrLM168a. Forty-five extreme susceptible plants from the F-2 families of LM168d x LM168b were genotyped with 836 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to map YrLM168a. YrLM168a was mapped in chromosome 6BL. The nearest flanking markers Xwmc756 and Xbarc146 were 4.6 and 4.6 cM away from the gene at both sides, respectively. The amplification results of twenty extreme resistant (IT 0) and susceptible (IT 4) F-2 plants of LM168c x LM168a and LM168a x LM168c with marker Xwmc756 further validated the mapping results. The study suggested that extreme individuals and recessive phenotype class can be successfully used for mapping genes, which should be efficient and reliable. In addition, the flanking markers near YrLM168a should be helpful in marker-assisted breeding.

AB Leaf rust of wheat caused by Puccinia triticina is one of the most wide spread and important diseases occurring in India. New pathotypes keep on evolving by overcoming the resistance genes present in the wheat varieties. Some of the predominant leaf rust pathotypes in India are 10, 12, 12-1, 12-2, 12-3, 12-4, 12-6, 77-1, 77-2, 77-3, 77-4, 77-5, 77-6, 77-8, 77-9, 104, 104-1, 104-2, 104-3, 104-4, 106, 162, 162-1 and 162-2. In the present study twenty four pathotypes of P. triticina were genetically characterized using URP primers. Out of the 12 URP primers taken for the study, 9 primers gave reproducible bands. Our results showed 40 to 90% polymorphism with amplified bands ranging from 250 to 4000 bp. There was positive correlation between URP based clustering and virulence/avirulence behaviour, geographical origin, evolution time of different leaf rust pathotypes.
   Some of the URP primers viz., URP 1F, URP 4R, URP 13R and URP 17R grouped all the pathotypes of race 104 group (viz., 104, 104-1, 104-2, 104-3 and 104-4) into a single cluster. In the present study 24 monomorphic bands were produced, these can be further utilised in development of species specific diagnostic marker for early detection of P. triticina. Our results indicate that URP's are sensitive markers which give reproducible results to study the genetic variability in P. triticina.

AB Although particle bombardment is the predominant method of foreign DNA direct transfer, whether transgene is integrated randomly into the genome has not been determined. In this study, we identified the distribution of transgene loci in 45 transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines containing co-transformed high molecular weight glutenin subunit genes and the selectable marker bar using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Transgene loci were shown to distribute unevenly throughout the genome and incorporate into different locations along individual chromosomes. There was only a slight tendency towards the localization of transgenes in distal chromosome regions. High proportions of transgenes in separate plasmids integrated at the same site and only 7 lines had 2 or 3 loci. Such loci may not segregate frequently in subsequent generations so it is difficult to remove selectable markers from transgenic lines after regeneration. We also found that three transgene lines were associated with rearranged chromosomes, suggesting a the close relationship between particle bombardment-mediated transgene integration and chromosomal rearrangements.

AB A compensating, recombined Lr59 translocation with greatly reduced alien chromatin was identified. Microsatellite locus Xdupw217 occurs within the remaining segment and can be used as a co-dominant marker for Lr59.
   In earlier studies, leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.) resistance gene Lr59 was transferred from Aegilops peregrina (Hackel) Maire et Weiler to chromosome arm 1AL of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The resistance gene was then genetically mapped on the translocated chromosome segment following homoeologous pairing induction. Eight recombinants that retained the least alien chromatin apparently resulted from crossover within a terminal region of the translocation that was structurally different from 1AL. These recombinants could not be differentiated by size, and it was not clear whether they were compensating in nature. The present study determined that the distal part of the original translocation has group 6 chromosome homoeology and a 6BS telomere (with the constitution of the full translocation chromosome being 1AS center dot 1L(P)center dot 6S(P) center dot 6BS). During the allosyndetic pairing induction experiment to map and shorten the full size translocation, a low frequency of quadrivalents involving 1A, the 1A translocation, and two 6B chromosomes was likely formed. Crossover within such quadrivalents apparently produced comparatively small compensating alien chromatin inserts within the 6BS satellite region on chromosome 6B of seven of the eight recombinants. It appears that the Gli-B2 storage protein locus on 6BS has not been affected by the recombination events, and the translocations are therefore not expected to affect baking quality. Simple sequence repeat marker results showed that Lr59-151 is the shortest recombinant, and it will therefore be used in breeding. Marker DUPW217 detects a homoeo-allele within the remaining alien chromatin that can be used for marker-assisted selection of Lr59.

AB By using 2V-specific EST-PCR markers and sequential GISH/FISH analysis, we identified four homozygous CS-2V translocation lines, including a novel compensating T2VS center dot 2DL translocation line NAU422. This translocation line has longer spikes and produces more grains per spike than its recurrent parent CS and three other translocation lines, which could be a valuable resource in wheat yield improvement.
   Dasypyrum villosum (2n = 14, VV), the wild relative of wheat, possesses novel and superior alleles at many important loci and should be utilized to improve the genetic diversity of cultivated wheat and may be very helpful for the improvement of wheat yield. In this study, four homozygous Chinese Spring (CS)-D. villosum translocation lines containing different fragments of chromosome 2V were characterized from a pool, including 76 translocations that occur in chromosomes 1 V through 7 V of D. villosum by both molecular markers and cytogenetic analysis. A rough physical map of 2V was developed which included nine markers in three segments of the short arm and ten markers in the long arm. The photoperiod response gene of D. villosum (Ppd-V1) was physically mapped to the FL 0.33-0.53 region of 2VS, while the gene controlling bristles on the glume ridges (Bgr-V1) was mapped to 2VS FL 0.00-0.33. A novel compensating Triticum aestivum-D. villosum Robertsonian translocation line T2VS center dot 2DL (NAU422) with good plant vigor and full fertility was further characterized by sequential genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization and the use of molecular markers. Compared to its recurrent parent CS and three other translocation lines, the T2VS center dot 2DL translocation line has longer spikes, more spikelets and more grains per spike in two season years, which suggested that the alien segment may carry yield-related genes of D. villosum. The developed T2VS center dot 2DL translocation line with its morphological and co-dominant molecular markers could be utilized as a novel germplasm for high-yield wheat breeding.

TI The identification of QTL controlling ergot sclerotia size in hexaploid

AB Four QTL conferring resistance to ergot were identified in the UK winter wheat varieties 'Robigus' and 'Solstice'. Two QTL co-located with semi-dwarfing alleles at the Rht loci Rht - 1B and Rht - 1D implicating a role of these DELLA proteins in infection success of Claviceps purpurea.
   The fungal pathogen Claviceps purpurea infects ovaries of a broad range of temperate grasses and cereals, including hexaploid wheat, causing a disease commonly known as ergot. Sclerotia produced in place of seed carry a cocktail of harmful alkaloid compounds that result in a range of symptoms in humans and animals, causing ergotism. Following a field assessment of C. purpurea infection in winter wheat, two varieties 'Robigus' and 'Solstice' were selected which consistently produced the largest differential effect on ergot sclerotia weights. They were crossed to produce a doubled haploid mapping population, and a marker map, consisting of 714 genetic loci and a total length of 2895 cM was produced. Four ergot reducing QTL were identified using both sclerotia weight and size as phenotypic parameters; QCp.niab.2A and QCp.niab.4B being detected in the wheat variety 'Robigus', and QCp.niab.6A and QCp.niab.4D in the variety 'Solstice'. The ergot resistance QTL QCp.niab.4B and QCp.niab.4D peaks mapped to the same markers as the known reduced height (Rht) loci on chromosomes 4B and 4D, Rht-B1 and Rht-D1, respectively. In both cases, the reduction in sclerotia weight and size was associated with the semi-dwarfing alleles, Rht-B1b from 'Robigus' and Rht-D1b from 'Solstice'. Two-dimensional, two-QTL scans identified significant additive interactions between QTL QCp.niab.4B and QCp.niab.4D, and between QCp.niab.2A and QCp.niab.4B when looking at sclerotia size, but not between QCp.niab.2A and QCp.niab.4D. The two plant height QTL, QPh.niab.4B and QPh.niab.4D, which mapped to the same locations as QCp.niab.4B and QCp.niab.4D, also displayed significant genetic interactions.

AB Crop landraces represent a source of useful genes endowing tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and other agronomic traits including yield. Our study involved 446 Afghan wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landraces collected from 16 provinces during three Japanese scientific expeditions in 1955, 1967, and 1979. The landraces and varieties were genotyped using 30,000 diversity array technology (DArT) genetic markers, of which 15,817 were polymorphic. The landraces were grouped into 15 subpopulations based on population structure and phylogenetic studies. DArT markers were used to group landraces based on their origins or collection sites and to differentiate East Asian genotypes, CIMMYT lines, and modern Afghanistan cultivars from Afghan landraces. The Afghan landraces were highly diverse compared with lines from other origins. These landraces seem to possess unique genes that might allow enrichment of the global wheat gene pool and improvements in wheat production worldwide. Our next objective is to identify genotypes with promising attributes and to conduct association mapping studies focusing on biotic and abiotic stresses.

   Many wheat- Agropyron cristatum derivative lines exhibit superior agronomic traits, and part of them are valuable for future wheat breeding. To date, no high-density genetic map for Agropyron Gaertn. has been published. Specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), a recently developed strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was employed in this study to develop sufficient markers for a segregating Agropyron F-1 population derived from an interspecific cross between two cross-pollinated diploid collections A. cristatum (L.) Beauv. 'Z1842' and A. mongolicum Keng 'Z2098'. In total, we obtained raw data consisting of 128,932,358 pair-end reads of 80 bp long after sequencing. Then 69,325 high-quality SLAFs were detected, of which 26,248 SLAFs were polymorphic and 1752 of the polymorphic markers were used for the genetic map construction. The final map contained 1023 markers on the seven linkage groups (LGs), which spanned a total of 907.8 cM with an average number of 146 markers and 89 loci per LG and an average distance of 1.5 cM between adjacent loci. To our knowledge, this map is the densest genetic linkage map for Agropyron so far. Through BLAT alignment of Agropyron SLAF marker sequences with the draft genome assemblies of wheat and barley, the Agropyron LGs were assigned as LG1-7 according to their corresponding homoeologous chromosomal groups of wheat. Results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/QTL fine mapping, but also serve as a reference to assist the assembling of the P genome sequence in future.

AB Recent declines in costs accelerated sequencing of many species with large genomes, including hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Although the draft sequence of bread wheat is known, it is still one of the major challenges to developlocus specific primers suitable to be used in marker assisted selection procedures, due to the high homology of the three genomes. In this study we describe an efficient approach for the development of locus specific primers comprising four steps, i.e. (i) identification of genomic and coding sequences (CDS) of candidate genes, (ii) intron-and exon-structure reconstruction, (iii) identification of wheat A, B and D sub-genome sequences and primer development based on sequence differences between the three sub-genomes, and (iv); testing of primers for functionality, correct size and localisation. This approach was applied to single, low and high copy genes involved in frost tolerance in wheat. In summary for 27 of these genes for which sequences were derived from Triticum aestivum, Triticum monococcum and Hordeum vulgare, a set of 119 primer pairs was developed and after testing on Nullitetrasomic (NT) lines, a set of 65 primer pairs (54.6%), corresponding to 19 candidate genes, turned out to be specific. Out of these a set of 35 fragments was selected for validation via Sanger's amplicon re-sequencing. All fragments, with the exception of one, could be assigned to the original reference sequence. The approach presented here showed a much higher specificity in primer development in comparison to techniques used so far in bread wheat and can be applied to other polyploid species with a known draft sequence.

AB Exploration of the biotype structure of Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), would improve our knowledge regarding variation in virulence phenotypes and difference in genetic background. Microsatellites (simple sequence repeats) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are highly variable genetic markers that are widely used in population genetic studies. This study developed and tested a panel of 18 microsatellite and 22 SNP markers to investigate the genetic structure of nine Hessian fly biotypes: B, C, D, E, GP, L, O, vH9, and vH13. The simple sequence repeats were more polymorphic than the SNP markers, and their neighbor-joining trees differed in consequence. Microsatellites suggested a simple geographic association of related biotypes that did not progressively gain virulence with increasing genetic distance from a founder type. Use of the k-means clustering algorithm in the STRUCTURE program shows that the nine biotypes comprise six to eight populations that are related to geography or history within laboratory cultures.

AB Background: NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factors play important roles in plant biological processes, including phytohormone homeostasis, plant development, and in responses to various environmental stresses.
   Methods: TaNAC29 was introduced into Arabidopsis using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral dipping method. TaNAC29-overexpression plants were subjected to salt and drought stresses for examining gene functions. To investigate tolerant mechanisms involved in the salt and drought responses, expression of related marker genes analyses were conducted, and related physiological indices were also measured. Expressions of genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
   Results: A novel NAC transcription factor gene, designated TaNAC29, was isolated from bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Sequence alignment suggested that TaNAC29 might be located on chromosome 2BS. TaNAC29 was localized to the nucleus in wheat protoplasts, and proved to have transcriptional activation activities in yeast. TaNAC29 was expressed at a higher level in the leaves, and expression levels were much higher in senescent leaves, indicating that TaNAC29 might be involved in the senescence process. TaNAC29 transcripts were increased following treatments with salt, PEG6000, H2O2, and abscisic acid (ABA). To examine TaNAC29 function, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaNAC29 were generated. Germination and root length assays of transgenic plants demonstrated that TaNAC29 overexpression plants had enhanced tolerances to high salinity and dehydration, and exhibited an ABA-hypersensitive response. When grown in the greenhouse, TaNAC29-overexpression plants showed the same tolerance response to salt and drought stresses at both the vegetative and reproductive period, and had delayed bolting and flowering in the reproductive period. Moreover, TaNAC29 overexpression plants accumulated lesser malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2, while had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities under high salinity and/or dehydration stress.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that TaNAC29 plays important roles in the senescence process and response to salt and drought stresses. ABA signal pathway and antioxidant enzyme systems are involved in TaNAC29-mediated stress tolerance mechanisms.

AB Drought is a worldwide concern and designation of drought stress adaptive mechanisms is one of the main directions in plant physiology and crop breeding. Genotypes diversity can be used to identify effective unexploited genes and pathways. In order to that, the effect of varying terminal drought intensity treatments on physiological and biochemical traits was evaluated in ILC3279, ICCV2 and FLIP9855C chickpea lines. Well-watered, intermediate and severe drought treatments were applied from flowering till maturity. Photosynthetic efficiency, membrane stability, soluble sugar and proline content, leaf protein profile, and antioxidant enzyme activities were compared on 1st, 3rd, and 5th week after applying stress. Based on the results, it was found that the susceptibility of photosynthetic machinery of ILC3279 was more than others. Tolerant genotypes responded to drought differently; an increase and a decrease in catalase activity have been observed in ICCV2 and FLIP9855C, respectively. The prominent role of soluble sugars was observed in ICCV2. Expressions of polypeptides 27 and 45 kDa in tolerant lines refer to their possible role in drought stress adaptation. Generally, in spite of significant variability in chickpea lines to cope with drought, lower ascorbate peroxidase activity, higher peroxidase activity, and higher Fv/Fm ratio can be tested as markers of chickpea drought tolerant.

AB A new stripe rust resistance gene, YrH52, derived from the unique Mount Hermon population of wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) in Israel, was previously located on chromosome 1B. The main objectives of the present study were to increase marker density in the vicinity of the YrH52 gene using additional microsatellite markers, and to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of marker-assisted selection on this gene in the F-2 generation. By means of 70 additional microsatellite primer pairs, 150 individuals of the F-2 mapping population were genotyped. Among 202 marker loci, 20 were found to be linked to the YrH52 gene with log-likelihood (LOD) scores ranging from 3.84 to 58.82, and linkage distances ranging from 0.33 to 41.39 cM. A genetic map was constructed of chromosome 1B, consisting of 23 markers and the YrH52 gene, with a total map length of 149.5 cM. Most of the markers were located in the region close to YrH52, which was flanked by Xgwm413 and Xgwm273a with map distances of 1.3 and 2.7 cM, respectively. The accuracy and efficiency of marker-assisted selection were calculated as AMAS and EMAS, respectively, for homozygous resistant genotypes of YrH52 gene in the F-2 generation. AMAS and EMAS for homozygous resistant genotypes of the YrH52 gene in the F-2 generation showed linear and significant negative correlation with the map distance between marker and target gene or between the two bracketing markers. It was concluded that the YrH52 region on chromosome 1B is significantly more enriched by microsatellite markers than the previously published map; that a single microsatellite marker is efficient for marker-assisted selection of homozygous resistant genotypes of YrH52 gene in the F-2 generation when the map distance is < 5.0 cM; and that when two markers are used AMAS can be dramatically improved and becomes relatively stable, whereas EMAS will not be obviously improved and will still vary linearly with map distance.

AB Isolates of Tilletia controversa and T. bromi were sampled from wheat and two Bromus species hosts, respectively, in the Pacific Northwest, and genetic variation within and among populations was determined. Fifty-one random amplified polymorphic DNA markers from eleven primers were treated as phenotypic I and 0 character state data to estimate similarities and analyze molecular variance (AMOVA) among populations and as putative genetic loci to carry out analyses of gene diversity. Phenotypic analysis of T. controversa and T. bromi isolates revealed two distinct clusters that were 37% similar. The T. Bromi cluster was subdivided further into two groups, corresponding to host, with 40% similarity. Cluster analysis based on allele frequencies produced similar results and also supported two T. bromi groups based on host, No evidence of natural hybridization and introgression was defected between the I: controversa and T. bromi populations. Both AMOVA and gene diversity analyses detected moderate levels of differentiation among T. controversa populations, whereas T. bromi populations were highly differentiated. The level of genetic differentiation observed between the I: bromi populations on different Bromus species hoses supports the hypothesis that a high degree of host specificity exists in the wild grass-infecting smuts. We speculate that the higher level of genetic differentiation among the T. bromi populations compared with the T. controversa populations on wheat may be due to selection by a more genetically diverse: host population.

AB Collections of Puccinia triticina, the wheat leaf rust fungus, were obtained from Great Britain, Slovakia, Israel, Germany, Australia, Italy, Spain, Hungary, South Africa, Uruguay, New Zealand, Brazil, Pakistan, Nepal, and eastern and western Canada. All single-uredinial isolates derived from the collections were tested for virulence polymorphism on 22 Thatcher wheat lines that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes. Based on virulence phenotype, selected isolates were also tested for randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) using 11 primers. The national collections were placed into 11 groups based on previously established epidemiological zones. Among the 131 single-uredinial isolates, 105 virulence phenotypes and 82 RAPD phenotypes were described. In a modified analysis of variance, 26% of the virulence variation was due to differences in isolates between groups, with the remainder attributable to differences within groups. Of the RAPD variation, 36% was due to differences in isolates between groups. Clustering based on the average virulence distance (simple distance coefficient) within and between groups resulted in eight groups that differed significantly. Collections from Australia-New Zealand, Spain, Italy, and Britain did not differ significantly for virulence. Clustering of RAPD marker differences (1 - Dice coefficient) distinguished nine groups that differed significantly. Collections from Spain and Italy did not differ significantly for RAPD variation, neither did collections from western Canada and South America. Groups of isolates distinguished by avirulent/virulent infection types to wheat lines with resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2c, and Lr3 also differed significantly for RAPD distance, showing a general relationship between virulence and RAPD phenotype. The results indicated that on a worldwide level collections of P. triticina differ for virulence and molecular backgrounds.

AB Aegilops variabilis no. 1 is the only known source of resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne naasi in wheat. Previous studies showed that a dominant gene, Rkn-mn1, was transferred to a wheat translocation line from the donor Ae. variabilis. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed on the wheat cultivar 'Lutin', on AE. variabilis, on a resistant disomic addition line and on a resistant translocation line. For genetic and molecular studies, 114-117 BC3F2 plants and F-3-derived families were tested. Five DNA and one isozyme marker were linked to Rkn-mn1. Three RAPD markers Ranking the Rkn-mn1 locus were mapped at 0 cM (OpY16(-1065)), 0.8 cM (OpB12(-1320)) and 1.7 cM (OpN20(-1235)), respectively. Since the Rh-n-mn1 gene remained effective, its introduction into different wheat cultivars by marker-assisted selection is suggested.

AB A linkage map of Lablab purpureus consisting of 127 RFLP and 91 RAPD loci was constructed in an F-2 population of 119 individuals. This population was derived from a cross between 'Rongai' (an annual cultivar) and CPI 24973 (a perennial wild accession). The map comprises 17 linkage groups and covers 1610 centiMorgans (cM) with an average distance of 7 cM between markers. Severe segregation distortions were observed, with the very extreme situation where no paternal type was recovered from the mapping population. These results strongly suggest the presence of a gene conferring preferential transmission from the maternal parent 'Rongai'. It was also clear that, while the majority of RAPD markers are valuable when used together with RFLP or other stringent marker systems, they could be problematic when used solely in mapping exercises.

AB Through random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis we identified a putative marker linked to the Dn5 resistance gene. This marker was converted to a more reliable sequence-characterised-amplified regions (SCAR) marker. The initial SCAR marker amplified the correct amplification product but failed to discern between the susceptible and resistant individuals. Hence, it was utilised to sequence the internal fragment. All nested primers designed from the internal sequences were also unable to produce any polymorphism between the susceptible and resistant cultivars. Restriction digests were then performed on these fragments, and the restriction enzyme EcoRI was able to discern between the susceptible and resistant F-2 individuals of the Dn5 population. This granted one marker amplified with the internal SCAR primer set OPF14(1083) the ability to differentiate between parental individuals carrying the Dn5 genes. This marker was tested in a segregating F2 population carrying the Dn5 resistance gene and proved able to differentiate between the segregating individuals. This marker may prove useful in marker assisted selection (MAS), although performing restriction digests may hamper the throughput of a high number of samples.

AB The genomic DNA of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) "Chinese Spring" (CS) and its ph1b mutant were analyzed by using 19 sequence tagged site PCR (STS-PCR) primers, which derived from RFLP probes from barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome 5H. One marker was identified on wheat chromosome 5BL, which is 5.7 cM (centiMorgan) proximal to Ph1 gene, using the CS homoeologous group 5 nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic 5BL line and an F-2 population from CS x ph1b mutant. This linked PCR marker was converted into a more specific sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker. To obtain a new winter wheat line containing phlb gene, the authors used a nullisomic 5B line of "Abbodanza" as a bridge parent and crossed respectively with the CS ph1b mutant (donor) and a winter wheat variety, "Jing 411" (recipient). The meiotic chromosome pairing was checked in the progeny of each cross, as well as using the marker-assistant selection of the SCAR marker identified for phlb gene.,After three inter-crossing and one selfing, a relatively stable ph1b substitution line of winter wheat with "Jing 411" background way obtained.

AB Grain Protein Content (GPC) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. and T. turgidum L.) is important for improved nutritional value and is also one of the major factors affecting breadmaking and pasta quality. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for high GPC was detected a few years ago in the short arm of chromosome 6B from accession FA15-3 of Triticum turgidum L. var, dicoccoides. New molecular markers are presented here to facilitate the transfer of this high GPC gene into tetraploid and hexaploid wheat cultivars. Two sets of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers were designed to amplify regions of the non-transcribed spacer of the XNor-B2 locus. This Locus was selected because it mapped on the peak of the QTL for GPC. The first pair of allele-specific primers produced an amplification product only when the T. turgidum var. dicoccoides XNor-B2 allele was present. The second pair of primers amplified fragment(s) of similar length in the different genotypes that after digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI allowed differentiation of the T. turgidum var, dicoccoides allele. Four microsatellites markers were mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6B at both sides of the QTL peak and two on the long arm. Five additional amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were mapped into the QTL region on 6BS. These PCR markers together with 10 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers showed that the hexaploid cultivar Glupro, selected for high GPC, carries a distal segment of chromosome 6BL and a proximal segment of 6BS from dicoccoides accession FA15-3 encompassing the segment with highest LOD score for the GPC QTL.

AB The 18S-5.8S-26S ribosomal RNA gene (18S-26S rDNA) loci were examined directly on mitotic chromosomes in the Korean endemic Lycoris flavescens and its related species by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method. The prominent yellow signals of biotin labeled rDNA probes were detected on three chromosomes in Lycoris sanguinea var. koreana, six in L. flavescens, and eight in L. chinensis. All of their signals were located at the distal end of rod shaped chromosomes. The other weak signals were associated with centromeric regions of metacentric chromosomes. One or two nucleolus organizing regions (NORs) were also found in all three specis. This result is reported for the first time and offers new cytological markers in Lycoris.

AB Although cold acclimation in cereals involves the expression of many cold-regulated genes, genetic studies have shown that only very few chromosomal regions carry loci that play an important role in frost tolerance. To investigate the genetic relationship between frost tolerance and the expression of cold-regulated genes, the expression and regulation of the wheat homolog of the barley cold-regulated gene cor14b was studied at various temperatures in frost-sensitive and frost-tolerant wheat genotypes. At 18/15 degrees C (day/night temperatures) frost-tolerant plants accumulated cor14b mRNAs and expressed cor14b proteins. whereas the sensitive plants did not. This result indicates that the threshold temperature for induction of the wheal cor13b homolog is higher in frost-resistant plants,and allowed us to use this polymorphism in a mapping approach. Studies made with chromosome substitution lines showed that the polymorphism for the threshold induction temperature of the wheat cor14b homolog is controlled by a locus(i) located on chromosome 5A of wheat. while the cor14b gene was mapped in Triticum monococcum on the long arm of chromosome 2A(m). The analysis of single chromosome recombinant lines derived from a cross between Chinese Spring/Triticum spelta 5A and Chinese Spring/Cheyenne A identified two loci with additive effects that are involved in the genetic control of cor14b mRNA accumulation. The first locus was tightly linked to the marker psr911, while the second one was located between the marker Xpsr2021 and Frost resistance 1 (Fr1).

AB Isolate ISR398 of Septoria tritici (which produces none to few pycnidia on the wheat cv. Seri 82 and high coverage on cv. Shafir) and isolate ISR8036 (which is virulent on both cultivars) were genetically cotransformed using the selectable marker gene hph, which confers resistance to hygromycin B (hygB), and the reporter gene uidA, encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS). Most of the genetically transformed isolates (98.8%) produced similar pycnidial coverage on seedlings of 'Seri 82' and 'Shafir' as the two wild-type isolates. Southern analysis of 25 randomly selected hygB(R)GUS(+) transformants probed with the uidA sequence revealed multiple insertion sites. GUS activity was determined fluorimetrically by measuring the conversion of 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucuronide (MUG) to 4-methylumbelliferone (MU). The high GUS-expressing transformants 398D97 and 8036E27 were used to elucidate fungal development within inoculated leaf tissue by using GUS activity to estimate the fungal proteins content in planta. Increase in fungal biomass was recorded in 'Shafir' inoculated with the GUS-expressing transformants 398D97 and 8036E27 following a 12-day latent period. A 15-day latent period was recorded in 'Seri 82' inoculated with 8036E27, whereas an 18-day latent period was recorded on 'Seri 82' inoculated with 398D97 and the two mixtures 398D97 + ISR8036 and ISR398 + 8036B27. The rate of fungal development and the estimated level of fungal proteins at the pycnidia maturation stage was high in leaves of 'Shafir' and moderate to low on 'Seri 82', even in cases in which no significant differences were recorded in pycnidial coverage. An endogenous capacity to hydrolyze beta-1,4-D-glucuronidase was recorded in leaves inoculated with wild-type isolates. The latent periods in MU production of the uidA-expressing transformants mimicked those recorded for the wild-type isolates. However, at all stages, the levels of MU produced in wheat inoculated with wild-type isolates were markedly lower than those produced by GUS-expressing transformants. The mode of interaction (compatible or incompatible) determined the onset of the induction, rate, and level of enzyme production.

AB This report describes the stable expression of a medically important antibody in the staple cereal crops rice and wheat. We successfully expressed a single-chain Fv antibody (ScFvT84.66) against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a well characterized tumor-associated marker antigen. scFv constructs were engineered for recombinant antibody targeting to the plant cell apoplast and ER. Up to 30 mu g/g of functional recombinant antibody was detected in the leaves and seeds of wheat and rice. We confirmed that transgenic dry seeds could be stored for at least five months at room temperature, without significant loss of the amount or activity of scFvT84.66. Our results represent the first transition from model plant expression systems, such as tobacco and Arabidopsis, to widely cultivated cereal crops, such as rice and wheat, for expression of an antibody molecule that has already shown efficacy in clinical applications. Thus, we have established that molecular pharming in cereals can be a viable production system for such high-value pharmaceutical macromolecules. Our findings provide a strong foundation for exploiting alternative uses of cereal crops both in industrialized and developing countries.

AB The S1, S2 and S3 genes of the induced sphaerococcoid mutation in common wheat (Triticum aestivum) were mapped using three different F-2 populations consisting of 71-96 individual plants. Twenty-four microsatellite markers from homeologous group 3 of T. aestivum were used to map the S1, S2 and S3 genes on chromosomes 3D, 3B and 3A, respectively. The SI locus was found to be closely linked to the centromeric marker Xgwm456 of the long arm (2.9 cM) and mapped not far (8.0 cM) from the Xgdm72 marker of the short arm of chromosome 3D. The S2 gene was tightly linked to 2 centromeric markers (Xgwm566, Xgwm845) of chromosome 3B. S3 was located between Xgwm2 (5.1 cM), the marker of the short arm, and Xgwm720 (6.6 cM), the marker of the long ann, both of chromosome 3A. Mapping the S1, S2 and S3 loci of the induced sphaerococcoid mutation near the centromeric regions supports the hypothesis that the sphaerococcum type may be due to gene duplication resulting from DNA recombination in the centromeric region.

AB In order to enhance the resolution of an existing genetic map of rice, and to obtain a comprehensive picture of marker utility and genomic distribution of microsatellites in this important grain species, rice DNA sequences containing simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were extracted from several small-insert genomic libraries and from the database. One hundred and eighty eight new microsatellite markers were developed and evaluated for allelic diversity. The new simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs) were incorporated into the existing map previously containing 124 SSR loci. The 312 microsatellite markers reported here provide whole-genome coverage with an average density of one SSLP per 6 cM. In this study, 26 SSLP markers were identified in published sequences of known genes, 65 were developed based on partial cDNA sequences available in GenBank, and 97 were isolated from ge-nomic libraries. Microsatellite markers with different SSR motifs are relatively uniformly distributed along rice chromosomes regardless of whether they were derived from genomic clones or cDNA sequences. However, the distribution of polymorphism detected by these markers varies between different regions of the genome.

ID POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; PCR MARKERS; WHEAT; BARLEY; DNA
AB The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a standard procedure in plant genetics, and is the basis for many emerging genomics approaches to mapping and gene identification. One advantage of PCR is that sequence information for primer sets can be exchanged between laboratories, obviating the need for exchange and maintenance of biological materials. Repeatability of primer sets, whereby the same products are amplified in different laboratories using the same primer set, is important to successful exchange and utilization. We have developed several hundred sequence-tagged site (STS) primer sets for wheat and barley. The ability of the primer sets to generate reproducible amplifications in other laboratories has been variable. We wished to empirically determine the properties of the primer sets that most influenced repeatability. A total of 96 primer sets were tested with four genomic DNA samples on each of four thermocyclers. All major bands were repeatable across all four thermocyclers for approximately 50% of the primer sets. Characteristics most often associated with differences in repeatability included primer GC content and 3prime-end stability of the primers. The propensity for primer-dimer formation was not a factor in repeatability. Our results provide empirical direction for the development of repeatable primer sets.

AB The wheat homoeologous Group 5 chromosomes were characterized physically in terms of rice linkage blocks using a deletion mapping approach. All three chromosomes, 5A, 5B, and 5D, were shown to have a similar structure, apart from the 4A-5A translocation on the distal end of chromosome arm 5AL. The physical mapping of rice markers on the deletion lines revealed that the whole of rice chromosome 9 is syntenous to a large block, proximal to the centromere, on the long arm. Likewise, a small segment of the distal end of the long arm showed conserved synteny with the distal one-third end of the long arm of rice chromosome 3. In between those conserved regions, there is a region on the long arm of the Group 5 chromosomes which shows broken synteny. The proximal part of the short arms of the Group 5 chromosomes showed conserved synteny with a segment of the short arm of rice chromosome 11 and the distal ends showed conserved synteny with a segment of rice chromosome 12. The physical locations of flowering time genes (Vrn and earliness per se) and the gene for grain hardness (Ha) on the Group 5 chromosomes were determined. These results indicate that comparative mapping using the deletion mapping approach is useful in the study of genome relationships, the physical location of genes, and can determine the appropriate gene cloning strategy.

AB Three types of callus tissues established from anther culture of eleven doubled haploid (DH) lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were evaluated for their ability in enhancing friable embryogenic (Type II) culture differentiation and genetic transformation. Differences between types of callus inocula were highly significant (P < 0.001), suggesting that the quality of the initial callus explant is of profound importance in encouraging the proliferation of Type II cultures. Other factors found to be crucial included weekly subculture of friable embryogenic callus tissues on a maintenance medium containing 30 mu M dicamba and a predominance of amino-acid nitrogen supplement. Transfer and integration of the beta-glucuronidase gene was also affected by the type of inoculum when suitable embryogenic cell cultures were transformed using silicon carbide whiskers and high velocity microprojectiles. Expression of the hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker gene sequence was confirmed in all the stably transformed cell lines maintained on selection media containing lethal levels of hygromycin. Comparatively, there were differences in the frequency of regenerable, transgenic clonal segments between whisker-treated and microprojectile bombarded tissues mainly as a result of the fact that cultures vortexed with whiskers were more capable of post-treatment cell proliferation and embryo differentiation than those bombarded with cDNA-coated microprojectiles. Conditions for obtaining these results are outlined and discussed in relation to the suitability of the two transformation strategies for producing transgenic cell aggregates of wheat.

AB Breeding durable resistance to pathogens and pests is a major task for modern plant breeders and pyramiding different resistance genes into a genotype is one way of achieving this. Three powdery mildew resistance gene combinations, Pm2 + Pm4a, Pm2 + Pm21, Pm4a + Pm21 were successfully integrated into an elite wheat cultivar 'Yang158'. Double homozygotes were selected from a small F-2 population with the help of molecular markers. As the parents were near-isogenic lines (NILs) of 'Yang158', the progenies showed good uniformity in morphological and other non-resistance agronomic traits. The present work illustrates the bright prospects for the utilization of molecular markers in breeding For host resistance.

AB Thirty-six wheat-Agropyron intermedium (host) Beauv. [Syn. Trichopyrum intermedium (host) A. Love, Elytrigia intermedia (host) Nevski, Thinopyrum intermedium (host) Barkworth and Dewey] 7A/7Ai-1 recombinant chromosomes were characterized using DNA markers. Analysis of recombinant chromosomes using 15 restriction fragment length polymorphism probes identified the homoeologous crossover products that had varying length of A. intermedium chromatin introgressed onto chromosome 7A of common wheat. The linear order of the probe loci was established along the lengths of the chromosomes. The short arm recombinants that had A. intermedium chromatin distal to the locus Xpsr108 and proximal to the locus Xpsr119 were resistant to wheat stem rust, indicating that the rust resistance gene (Sr44) was located on the distal part of chromosome arm 7Ai-1s. The barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance gene reported to be present on the long arm of chromosome 7Ai-1 was found to be ineffective against the BYDV serotype used in the present study.

AB For a simple, rapid and PCR-based screening of sex in the cultivated asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.), we developed five STS markers from previously mapped, low-copy, sex-linked AFLP markers. A male/female PCR assay was feasible with these STS markers either by direct amplification or by digestion with restriction enzymes. Similar to the AFLP markers from which they were derived, STS4150.1, STS4150.2, STS4150.3 and STS3156 did not give recombinants in five different populations. STS3660 could be scored codominantly enabling the differentiation of XY from YY males in the screened FL! mapping population. The use of the sex-linked STS markers should allow early identification of sex, thus accelerating the breeding process for new asparagus varieties. Further, 10 additional AFLP markers obtained with PstI/MseI primer combinations have been mapped on the L5 chromosome, bringing the total number of known AFLP and STS markers flanking the sex locus to 24. These markers can be utilized for fine mapping of the sex gene in asparagus, which will pave the way for a map-based cloning approach.

AB Genetic mapping and the selection of closely linked molecular markers for important agronomic traits require efficient, large-scale genotyping methods. A semi-automated multifluorophore technique was applied for genotyping AFLP marker loci in barley and wheat. In comparison to conventional P-33-based AFLP analysis the technique showed a higher resolution of amplicons, thus increasing the number of distinguishable fragments. Automated sizing of the same fragment in different lanes or different gels showed high conformity, allowing subsequent unambigous allele-typing. Simultaneous electrophoresis of different AFLP samples in one lane (multi-mixing), as well as simultaneous amplification of AFLP fragments with different primer combinations in one reaction (multiplexing), displayed consistent results with respect to fragment number, polymorphic peaks and correct size-calling. The accuracy of semi-automated codominant analysis for hemizygous AFLP markers in an F-2 population was too low, proposing the use of dominant allele-typing defaults. Nevertheless, the efficiency of genetic mapping, especially of complex plant genomes, will be accelerated by combining the presented genotyping procedures.

AB Pm6 in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which was transferred from Triticum. timopheevii L., is a gene conferring resistance to the powdery mildew disease caused by Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici. Six near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Pm6 in a cultivar 'Prins' background were analyzed to map this gene using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Each of the six NILs possessed a T. timopheevii-derived segment, varying in length, and associated with powdery mildew resistance. Lines IGV1-465 (FAO163b/ 7*Prins) and IGV1-467 (Idaed 59B/7*Prins) had the shortest introgressed segments, which were detected only by DNA probes BCD135 and PSR934, respectively. The polymorphic loci detected by both probes were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2B. Lines IGV1-458 (CI13250/7*Prins) and IGV1-456 (CI12559/8*Prins) contained the longest I: timopheevii segments involving both arms of donor chromosome 2G across the centromere. All these introgressed segments had an overlapping region flanked by the loci xspr934 and xbcd135 on 2BL. Thus, Pm6 was located in this region since the powdery mildew resistance in all the NILs resulted from the introgressed fragments. Using the F-2 mapping population from a cross of IGV1-463 (PI170914/7*Prins)xPrins, Pm6 was shown to be closely linked to the loci xbcd135 and xbcd266 at a genetic distance of 1.6 cM and 4.8 cM, respectively. BCD135 was successfully used in detecting the presence of Pm6 in different genetic backgrounds.

AB A dominant allele at the Q locus on chromosome 5A is believed to be the principal factor responsible for free-threshing, square-head spikes with a nonfragile rachis in bread wheat, Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum. The spelt syndrome, resulting in pyramidal spikes with a brittle rachis and hulled grain in I: aestivum, is believed to be principally caused by the q allele. Chromosome 5A of European and Iranian spelt was substituted for 5A of bread wheat and the lines were characterized with molecular markers. The substitution of bread wheat chromosome 5A by 5A of European spelt resulted in weakly hulled, pyramidal spikes with a non-brittle rachis, whereas and the substitution of 5A by 5A of Iranian spelt did not alter spike morphology at all. It is concluded that the expression of the spelt syndrome depends, to a large extent, on the interactions of q with genes controlling glume tenacity and rachis fragility on other chromosomes. The genetic basis for the spelt syndrome and the apparent presence of the Q allele in Iranian spelt are discussed.

AB A cloned cDNA to the wheat (Triticum aestivum) early cysteine-labeled metallothionein (EcMt) has been identified as a molecular marker for pollen embryogenesis in this plant. This transcript is not detected in uninucleate microspores at the time of culture or in pollen at any stage during normal ontogeny; its mRNA does increase in embryogenic microspores within 6 h of culture, peaks at around 24 h, declines, then levels off through the next 21 days of development. Additionally, the accumulation of the embryoid-abundant EcMt gene transcript shows a direct and positive correlation with an increase in abscisic acid (ABA) in embryogenic microspores and developing pollen embryoids. External Ca2+ is required for in vitro pollen morphogenesis, since reduced Ca2+ concentrations in the medium suppressed EcMt transcript accumulation and the ability of microspores to form embryoids; however, endogenous ABA levels were unaffected my manipulating calcium concentrations in the medium. The calmodulin antagonist, W-7 also suppressed androgenesis and EcMt levels in treated microspores without altering ABA concentrations. These results suggest that ABA alone cannot maintain sporophytic differentiation of microspores and that Ca2+ may play a role in signal transduction during pollen androgenesis in bread wheat.

AB The sequence of the puroindoline-b gene from 15 Australian wheat cultivars was determined. Sequence variation was observed in the WPTKWWKGGCE motif of the deduced puroindoline-b protein sequence. Previously, it has been suggested that this sequence is crucial in determining grain hardness. In this study, no correlation was found between the variation in this sequence and the hardness or softness of the cultivar. The amounts of puroindoline-a and puroindoline-b protein in a selection of hard and soft Australian wheat cultivars were also determined using ELISA techniques. Both soft and hard cultivars had variable amounts of puroindoline-a and puroindoline-b. In particular, it is notable that the hard cultivars Cook and Diaz contained high amounts of puroindoline-a and puroindoline-b and also contained the puroindoline-b sequence previously reported to be associated with grain softness. These results suggest that if the puroindoline proteins are involved in determining grain softness or hardness they do so as part of a multi-component mechanism.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes strains were screened using immature zygotic embryos from the two wheat varieties Bobwhite and Lona (Triticum aestivum L.). Transient T-DNA transfer to plant cells was shown using a beta-glucuronidase (gus)-intron marker gene. A. rhizogenes LBA9402 transferred the T-DNA efficiently to wheat cells, where it was highly expressed. The efficiency of T-DNA transfer was influenced by the cocultivation time, the Agrobacterium concentration and the preculture time of the isolated immature embryos before inoculation.

AB A bioassay condition was developed to evaluate the low temperature response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings. Under this condition, an indica cultivar 'Hokuriku 142' did not survive. while a japonica cultivar 'Hyogo-Kitanishiki' showed 100% survival. A cross was made between the two cultivars to obtain F-2 and F-3 progenies. A frame map with 61 RFLP markers was constructed using 69 F(2)s, in which the segregation of all the markers was normal. Mean responses to the low temperature treatment of individual F(2)s were scored based on a 1-5 scale rating using F(3)s. A normal distribution was obtained showing that the low temperature response at the seedling stage was controlled by polygenes. Thirteen QTLs associated with the: low temperature response were detected on the rice chromosomes 1, 3, 9 and ii by the single point analysis. All QTLs except for 2 on chromosome 9 were with the effect in the same directions to those expected from the parental responses. The interval analysis revealed four QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3 and 11. The QTL-locating chromosomes 3, 9 and 11 show synteny with chromosome 5 of wheat and 7 (5H) of barley carrying genes for freezing tolerance.

AB The rDNA loci, and their associated NORs, on chromosomes 1 (B) under bar and 6 (B) under bar of the hexaploid wheat cv. Lindstrom have been used as a chromatin marker to investigate the functional basis of the phenotype effects of introgressed supernumerary B chromosomes (Bs) of rye. The rye Bs themselves lack genes, other than those which determine their mitotic drive mechanism, and the way in which they can modulate characters determined by the A chromosome background has always been a puzzle. An isogenic line of Lindstrom plants carrying different numbers of Bs was used as the experimental system to see how different doses of Bs (from 0 to 6) affected the activity of the wheat NORs and the organization of their rDNA loci at interphase. Silver staining on metaphase chromosomes was used to evaluate the previous activity of the NORs, and to reveal variations in their size; and the pTa71 FISH probe from wheat was used to visualize structural modifications to the interphase rDNA loci. A single B had no measurable effect, but, as the B-number increased, there were significant changes in the physical dimensions of the metaphase NORs, reflecting reduced levels of their activity earlier in the cell cycle, and also in the condensation patterns of the interphase rDNA loci. In addition, the higher B-numbers caused a size heteromorphism between the homologous NORs. A model is discussed which interprets the phenotypic effects of Bs generically, in nucleotypic terms, based of their being 'genetically inert' but 'chromosomally active'.

AB BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search) analyses of Hordeum chilense RAPD markers have shown DNA sequence similarities with several plant genes. Biologically significant hits were scored for: plastocianin (Hordeum vulgare), alpha -gliadin (Triticum aestivum), Grandel-6 retrotransposon (Zen diploperennis), retrofit (gag/pol) copia-like, transposon-like element (Oryza longistaminata), copia-like retrotransposon Hopscotch polyprotein (gag/pol) (Zea mays) and several retrotransposons/retroelements from other species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Pisum sativum and Zea mays). Statistically significant hits also included endochitinase (Brassica napus), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Euglena gracilis), piruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (Flaveria trinervia), and an ORF flanked by ARS sequences (Triticum aestivum). Interestingly, it was also found that the currently recommended BLAST algorithm (version 2.0.11; gapped) at < http:/ / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov > did not produce any biologically significant hits, whereas the previous version (1.4.11; ungapped) did generate biologically significant results. Thus, we suggest using the new BLAST 2.0.x when strong homologies are expected in short sequence stretches between closely related species. In other instances land particularly when searching for lower similarities, yet spanning significantly larger stretches between more distant species), the BLAST 1.4.x could yield additional results. BLAST searches are valuable tools to identify and clone DNA sequences of interest, with applications in Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) and wheat introgression.

AB Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and T. spelta (Sp)) were used for RFLP analysis of heading date and heterosis. Fourteen RFLP markers linking with heading date were identified; two were localized on chromosome 1A, one on 2A, three on 2B, one on 2D, four on 5A, two on 7A and one unlinked but reported to be on group 2. All of these markers may be attributable to genes for earliness par sc. However, the markers in the chromosomes of 1A and 7A are new to this study. RILs were crossed with (tim)-CS, the alloplasmic CS with T. timopheevi cytoplasm, and the heterosis from earlier-parent and mid-parents were calculated for the F(1)s to examine the heterotic effect toward earliness on heading date. Five and two RFLP markers were associated with heterosis from the earlier-parent and mid-parents, respectively. They were distributed on the chromosomes of homoeologous groups 1 and 2.

AB Using the marker information of 275 F-2 plants quantitative traits determining morphological and yield characters were studied analyzing F-3 progenies grown in four different experiments at three sites. The map constructed contains 113 markers including the major dwarfing gene Ddw1 with an average distance of about 10 cM between adjacent markers. Of the 21 QTLs detected ten were found to map on chromosome 5RL in the region of Ddw1. Beside the expected effects on plant height and peduncle length that are most probably due to the presence of the major dwarfing gene, additional effects on yield characters and flowering time were discovered in that region which may be caused by pleiotropic effects of Ddw1. An additional supposed gene cluster consisting of four QTLs controlling flowering time and yield components was discovered in the centromere region of chromosome 2R. Further loci are distributed on chromosomes 1R (1), 4R (1) 6R (3) and 7R (1). The map positions of the quantitative trait loci detected in rye are discussed in relation to major genes or QTLs determining agronomically important traits in other cereals.

AB An Israeli accession (TTD140) of wild emmer, Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides, was found resistant to several races of powdery mildew. Inoculation of the chromosome-arm substitution lines (CASLs) of TTD140, in the background of the Israeli common wheat cultivar 'Bethlehem' (BL), with five isolates of powdery mildew revealed that only the line carrying the short arm of chromosome 2B of wild emmer (CASL 2BS) exhibited complete resistance to four of the five isolates. To map and tag the powdery mildew resistance gene, 41 recombinant substitution lines, derived from a cross between BL and CASL 2BS, were used to construct a linkage map at the gene region. The map, which encompasses 69.5 cM of the distal region of chromosome arm 2BS, contains six RFLP markers, a morphological marker (glaucousness inhibitor, W1(1)), and the powdery mildew resistance gene. Segregation ratios for resistance in F-2 of BL x CASL 2BS and in the recombinant lines, combined with the susceptability of F-1 progeny to all tested isolates, indicate that resistance is controlled by a single recessive allele. This allele co-segregated with a polymorphic locus detected by the DNA marker Xwg516, 49.4 cM from the terminal marker Xcdo456. The new powdery mildew resistance gene was designated Pm26.

AB Previously chromosome 3A of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) was reported to carry genes influencing yield, yield components, plant height, and anthesis date. The objective of current study was to survey various molecular marker systems for their ability to detect polymorphism between wheat cultivars Cheyenne (CNN) and Wichita (WI), particularly for chromosome 3A. Seventy-seven 'sequence tagged site' (STS), 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 40 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, and 52 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes for wheat homoeologous group 3 chromosomes, were investigated. Three (3.9%) STS-PCR primer sets amplified polymorphic fragments for the two cultivars, of which one was polymorphic for chromosome 3A. Sixty percent of SSR markers detected polymorphism between CNN and WI of which 50% were polymorphic for chromosome 3A. Twenty pecent of RAPD markers detected polymorphism between CNN and WI in general, but none of these detected polymorphism for chromosome 3A. Of the fifty-two RFLP probes, 78.8% detected polymorphism between CNN and WI for group 3 chromosomes with one or more of seven restriction enzymes and 42% of the polymorphic fragements were for chromosome 3A. These high levels of RFLP and SSR polymorphisms between two related wheat cultivars could be used to map and tag genes influencing important agronomic traits. It may also be important to reconsider RFLP as the most suitable marker system at least for anchor maps of closely related wheat cultivars.

AB A set of T. aestivum-L. elongatum chromosome substitution lines was tested for yellow rust resistance at the seedling stage. Inheritance of the resistance and esterase-5 (Est-5) variation were studied. The results demonstrated that L. elongatum carried a new gene(s) conferring yellow rust resistance. This gene was dominant and located on chromosome 3E of L. elongatum. The biochemical locus encoding Est-5 was also located on chromosome 3E, and co-segregated with the Yr gene(s) in the wheat background. The transmission frequencies of chromosome 3E in 3E(3A) x CS, 3E(3B) x CS and 3E(3D) x CS hybrids were scored. None of the hybrids transmitted the alien chromosome at the theoretical maximum rate, but the transmission frequencies of chromosome 3E in F-2 populations of 3E(3A) x CS and 3E(3D) x CS were significantly higher than in that of 3E(3B) x CS.

DE addition line; gene mapping; meiotic abnormalities; sterility
AB The isolation of six of the seven possible additions of barley chromosomes to the wheat genome reported 18 years ago has made an important contribution to gene mapping in barley, first with genes controlling isozymes and more recently DNA (molecular) markers. A fertile addition line involving barley chromosome 1H, which carries genes controlling several characters of economic importance, could not be isolated at that time because it caused extreme meiotic abnormalities leading to complete sterility when added to wheat. Later the short arm of barley chromosome 1H was added to wheat as a fertile ditelosomic addition, but the non-availability of the entire barley chromosome 1H addition line has hampered the location of barley genes to the long arm of this chromosome. This problem has now been overcome cytogenetically as described herein. The resultant self-fertile disomic-monotelodisomic addition line carrying a pair of barley chromosome 6H and a heteromorphic 1H/1HS pair is more stable, and makes the wheat-barley addition line series complete for gene mapping work and will provide a vehicle for the possible transfer of useful genes from this barley chromosome to wheat.

AB Two stripe-rust resistance genes, YrH52 and Yr15, derived from the Israeli wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, have been located on chromosome 1B. The main objectives of the present study were to increase marker density in the vicinity of YrH52 gene by means of AFLP, RAPD and microsatellite markers, to improve the map of another T. dicoccoides-derived stripe-rust resistance gene Yr15 using microsatellite markers, and to preliminarily discriminate these two genes. Additional 26 marker loci comprising 20 AFLPs, three RAPDs, and three microsatellites were found to be linked to YrH52 gene. An updated genetic map consisting of 45 marker loci, in the region of YrH52 gene, was constructed with a total map length of 107.7 cm. The mean interval length was 0.96 cm in the region Xgwm359b-P55M53b carrying YrH52 gene. YrH52 was bracketed by Xgwm413 (Nor1 and UBC212a) and Xgwm273a (Xgwm273d) with map distance of 1.3 and 2.7 cm from either side, respectively. Eight additional microsatellite markers were found to be linked with Yr15, and the linkage map of Yr15 gene was thus obviously improved. In the YrH52-mapping population, no crossover was detected in the interval UBC212a (Xgwm413)-Yr15-Nor1, and YrH52 was located distally outside this interval. It may suggest that YrH52 is different from Yr15 even though both of them are derived from T. dicoccoides and are mapped on chromosome 1BS. The large number of molecular makers revealed in the present study would be helpful for the marker-assisted introgression of the T. dicoccoides-derived YrH52 and Yr15 stripe-rust resistance genes into elite cultivars of wheat, and the high-density map would accelerate the map-based cloning of the two genes.

AB 5S rRNA intergenic spacers were amplified from two elite sugarcane (Saccharum hybrids) cultivars and their related taxa by polymerase chain traction (PCR) with 5S rDNA consensus primers. Resulting PCR products were uniform in length fi om each accession but exhibited some degree of length variation among the sugarcane accessions and related tars. These PCR products did not always cross hybridize in Southern blot hybridization experiments. These PCR products were cloned into a commercial plasmid vector PCR(TM) 2.1 and sequenced. Direct sequencing or cloned PCR products revealed spacer length of 231-237 bp for S. officinarum, 233-237 for sugarcane cultivars, 228-238 bp for S. spontaneum, 239-252 bp for S. giganteum, 385-410bp for Erianthus spp., 226-230 bp for Miscanthus sinensis Zebra, 206-207 bp for M. sinensis IMP 3057, 207-209 bp for Sorghum bicolor, and 247-249 bp for Zea mays. Nucleotide sequence polymorphism were found at both the segment and single nucleotide level. A consensus sequence fur each taxon was obtained by Align X. Multiple sequences were aligned and phylogenetic trees constructed using Align X, CLUSTAL and DNAMAN programs. In general, accessions of the following taxa tended to group together to form distinct clusters: S. giganteum, Erianthus spp., M, sinensis, S. bicolor, and Z. mays. However, the two S. officinarum clones and two sugarcane cultivars did not form distinct clusters but interrelated within the S. spontaneum cluster. The disclosure of these 5S rRNA intergenic spacer sequences will facilitate marker-assisted breeding in sugarcane.

AB We have developed a new technique for the physical mapping of barley chromosomes using microdissected translocation chromosomes for PCR with sequence-tagged site primers derived from >300 genetically mapped RFLP probes. The positions of 240 translocation breakpoints were integrated as physical landmarks into linkage maps of the seven barley chromosomes. This strategy proved to be highly efficient in relating physical to genetic distances. A very heterogeneous distribution of recombination rates was found along individual chromosomes. Recombination is mainly confined to a few relatively small areas spaced by large segments in which recombination is severely suppressed. The regions of highest recombination frequency (less than or equal to 1 Mb/cM) correspond to only 4.9% of the total barley genome and harbor 47.3% of the 429 markers of the studied RFLP map. The results for barley correspond well with those obtained by deletion mapping in wheat. This indicates that chromosomal regions characterized by similar recombination frequencies and marker densities are highly conserved between cell the genomes of barley and wheat. The findings for barley support the conclusions drawn from deletion mapping in wheat that for all plant genomes, notwithstanding their size, the marker-rich regions are all of similar gene density and recombination activity and, therefore, should be equally accessible to map-based cloning.

DE GM crops; food security; public perception; safety issues; benefits
ID GLYPHOSATE; SOYBEANS
AB With increasing population and decreasing area of land available for food production the development and use of genetically modified (GM) crops is considered as an important tool to ensure global food security. The rigorous safety evaluation, which can take up to 10 years by independent Regulatory Agencies prior to final approval of GM crops, is noted. The rapid uptake of GM technology is illustrated by the increase, between 1996/1999, from 2 to 40 million hectares and that while 72% is grown in the USA a further 15 countries grew GM crops. The paper discusses a number of safety issues including antibiotic resistance marker genes, potential allergenicity, substantial equivalence, consumption of transgenic protein and transgenic DNA and their detection in milk, meal and eggs. Far from increasing the risk of allergenicity GM technology can offer the opportunity to reduce/eliminate protein allergens that occur naturally in foods such as rice, wheat and peanuts and that GM crops are compositionally (laboratory analysis) and nutritionally (animal feeding studies) equivalent to their conventional counterparts. The paper notes that while concern has been expressed about the possible accumulation of transgenic protein and DNA in milk, meal and eggs, and the possible implications of this on animal and human health, the regulatory agencies and the World Health Organisation concluded that there is no inherent risk in consuming DNA, including that fi om GM crops as mammals have always consumed significant quantities of DNA from a wide variety of sources, including plants, animals, bacteria, parasites and viruses. To date transgenic protein and DNA have not been found in milk, meat and eggs. The paper concludes, by providing numerous examples of the potential benefits to the farmer, consumer and the environment in both developed and developing countries, with particular emphasis on the ability of GM technology to increase crop yield, improve food quality and to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by amongst other things the lower use of less toxic agrochemicals.

AB The development of new barleys tolerant of abiotic and biotic stresses is an essential part of the continued improvement of the crop. The domestication of barley, as in many crops, resulted in a marked truncation of the genetical variation present in wild populations. This process is significant to agronomists and scientists because a lack of allelic variation will prevent the development of adapted cultivars and hinder the investigation of the genetic mechanisms underlying performance. Wild barley would be a useful source of new genetic variation for abiotic stress tolerance if surveys identify appropriate genetic variation and the development of marker-assisted selection allows efficient manipulation in cultivar development. There are many wild barley collections from all areas of its natural distribution, but the largest are derived from the Mediterranean region. The results of a range of assays designed to explore abiotic stress tolerance in barley are reported in this paper. The assays included; sodium chloride uptake in wild barley and a mapping population, effects for delta(13)C and plant dry weight in wheat aneuploids, effects of photoperiod and vernalization in wild barley, and measurements of root length in wild barley given drought and nitrogen starvation treatments in hydroponic culture. There are examples of the use of wild barley in breeding programmes, for example, as a source of new disease resistance genes, but the further exploration of the differences between wild barley and cultivars is hampered by the lack of good genetic maps. In parallel to the need for genetic studies there is also a need for the development of good physiological models of crop responses to the environment. Given these tools, wild barley offers the prospect of a 'goldmine' of untapped genetic reserves.

AB Secondary salinization and its relationship to irrigation are strong incentives to improve the tolerance of crops to salinity and to drought. Achieving this through the pyramiding of physiological traits (phenotypic selection without knowledge of genotype) is feasible. However, wide application of this approach is limited by the practicalities of assessing not only the parents, but also large numbers of individuals and families in segregating generations. Genotypic information is required in the form of markers for any quantitative trait loci involved (marker-assisted selection) or of direct knowledge of the genes. In the absence of adequate candidate genes for salt tolerance, a quantitative trait locus/marker-assisted selection approach has been used here. Putative markers for ion transport and selectivity, identified from analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism, had been discovered within a custom-made mapping population of rice. Here it is reported that none of these markers showed any association with similar traits in a closely related population of recombinant inbred lines or in selections of a cultivar. Whilst markers will be of value in using elite lines from the mapping population in backcrossing, this has to be considered alongside the effort required to develop and map any given population. This result cautions against any expectation of a general applicability of markers for physiological traits, It is concluded that direct knowledge of the genes involved is needed. This cannot be achieved at present by positional cloning. The elucidation of candidate genes is required. Here the problem lies not in the analysis of gene expression but in devising protocols in which only those genes of interest are differentially affected by the experimental treatments.

AB The biotrophic rust fungus Puccinia graminis f sp. tritici (Pgt) was transformed by particle bombardment. The promoter from the Pgt translation elongation factor 1 alpha(EF-1 alpha) gene was fused to the bacterial marker genes hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hpt) and beta-glucuronidase (CUS). Transformation constructs were introduced into uredospores of Pgt, an obligate pathogen of wheat, by biolistic bombardment. Uredospores transformed with the construct containing the hpr gene germinated and initiated branching on selective medium, indicating that they had acquired resistance to hygromycin B. However, transformants stopped growing 5 days after bombardment. CUS activity in uredospores and germlings was histochemically detected 4-16 h after bombardment. CUS expression was also obtained using the INF24 promoter from the bean rust fungus Uromyces appendiculatus, demonstrating that heterologous genes can be expressed in P. graminis under the control of regulatory sequences from closely related organisms.

AB A method for producing large numbers of transgenic wheat plants has been developed. With this approach, an average of 9.7% of immature embryo explants were transformed and generated multiple self-fertile, independently transformed plants. No untransformed plants, or escapes, were regenerated. This transformation procedure uses morphogenic calli derived from scutellum tissue of immature embryos of Triticum aestivum cv. Bobwhite co-bombarded with separate plasmids carrying a selectable marker gene (bar) and a gene of interest, respectively. Transformed wheat calli with a vigorous growth phenotype were obtained by extended culture on media containing 5.0 mg/l bialaphos. These calli retained morphogenic potential and were competent for plant regeneration for as long as 11 months. The bar gene and the gene of interest were co-expressed in T0 progeny plants. This wheat transformation protocol may facilitate quantitative production of multiple transgenic plants and significantly reduce the cost and labor otherwise required for screening out untransformed escapes.

AB The recent development of molecular marker technology is revolutionising the study of plant populations, providing opportunities to address questions requiring a precise knowledge of pedigrees. We applied Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) PCR to several Brassica oleracea accessions and to Br Brassica napus. Four microsatellite-primers were screened and, among the 136 reproducible fragments recorded, 25 (18.4%) fragments were common for all Brassica, 27 (19.9%) were unique and 84 (61.7%) were phylogenetically informative. Each individual test sample exhibited a unique molecular genotype. ISSR markers provided a rapid approach to analyse genetic diversity and reflected the known genetic relationships among selected entries. ISSR markers appeared of great value in gene bank management and the establishment of genetic similarity, and can be applied to allogamous (autumn and winter cauliflower) crops.

AB Several disease-resistant recombinants between barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bulbous barley grass (H. bulbosum) have been obtained in recent years, but the process of characterization is often laborious and time-consuming. In order to improve the identification and chromosomal location of introgressed chromatin from H, bulbosum into the barley genome, we employed sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). GISH enabled us to establish that an introgression was present in the disease-resistant recombinant line, and the subsequent use of FISH, with a short oligonucleotide sequence as probe, allowed us to locate the introgression on the long arm of barley chromosome 2H. These data were confirmed using RFLP probes that hybridize to barley chromosome 2HL.

AB Segregation distortion is a common phenomenon among anther-culture-derived plants and it has been suggested that the distorted areas may contain genes affecting survival in anther-culture. Segregation of 111 markers was checked in an androgenetic barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) progeny and a linkage map was constructed. Thirty one progeny lines were tested for their anther-culture ability and associations between molecular markers and anther-culture traits were established. Two regions on chromosomes 2H and 4H were associated with anther response, three on 2H (two areas) and 3H with plant regeneration rate, and one on 4H with spontaneous diploidization. The chromosomal regions controlling anther-culture response and the regions where distorted segregation was found were not always the same.

AB Telosomic stocks have been extensively used to map genes to chromosome arms and to determine gene-to-centromere genetic distances. It has been suggested that if a chromosome arm is present as a telosome, recombination frequencies will be drastically reduced in the centromeric region. However, previous studies have not considered the bias in recombination estimates due to selection against aneuploid gametes produced by failure of pairing at the first meiotic division. Formulas are derived here for adjusting recombination estimates for this bias. Adjusted recombination frequencies between markers located on both sides of the centomeres are analyzed in three different pairs of wheat (Triticum aestivum) isogenic segregating populations involving bibrachial and telocentric chromosomes. Recombination frequencies estimated from crosses involving telocentric chromosomes were not significantly different from recombination frequencies estimated from isogenic crosses involving bibrachial chromosomes. The implications of the present findings for karyotype evolution, and specifically for Robertsonian fissions and fusions, are discussed.

AB Two wheat consensus primer sets, directed to "early-methionine-labelled" (Em) gene sequences, were tested for their ability to amplify beyond their original source. A range of widely diverse templates, including other Triticeae species and sample monocot and dicot species, was assayed. Primer set EMC5/EMC3, amplifying the entire coding region with its intron and part of the 3' untranslated region, targets Triticeae and sorghum Fm sequences. The other set, EMC5/EMC031, directed to the coding region and its intron, amplifies templates from all the grass species. Both primer sets fail to amplify Fm sequences from more distant monocots and the dicots. Using set EMC5/EMC3, we isolated and sequenced ten members of the rye Em gene family from five differ ent rye sources. Significant DNA sequence variation between wheat and rye sequences in the non-coding regions was found, and this was used to develop seven sequence-specific primers. Twelve primer combinations were analysed, 7 of which were Em-R1-specific, amplifying a product in at least one of the tested rye or rye-carrying genotypes but not in wheat. Four sets exhibited clear amplification length polymorphisms which allowed discrimination between and within the Die sources. The primers also discriminated between wheat-rye recombinants with proximal 1RL rye chromatin and those carrying distal 1RL rye chromatin. These results show that wheat consensus primer sets can be used to isolate orthologous sequences, especially from species that are used for alien gene transfer in wheat. Subsequently, species-specific assays can be designed that are useful tools for this application.

AB Azospirillum brasilense strains, CDJA and A40, capable of growing at sub-optimal temperature were tagged with stable chromogenic marker Tn5-lacZ. Mutants were screened for plant growth promoting activities at 20, 22, 25, 30 and 37 degreesC. Mutants MC48 and MA3 were found to fix nitrogen upto 85% and produced indole acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore in isogenic manner to their respective wild type strains, CDJA and A40, at sub-optimal temperatures. Co-inoculation of mutants with their respective parent (1:1 ratio) to the wheat revealed that colonization potential of the mutants was affected greatly. Tn5-lacZ tagged mutants MC48 and MA3 were found isogenic to their respective wild type Azospirillum strain, with regards to plant growth promoting activities and root colonization ability.

AB A study of homoeologous recombination along almost the complete genetic length of two homoeologous chromosomes in the Triticeae was conducted. Sears' ph1b mutant was used to induce homoeologous pairing between chromosomes 7A of common wheat and 7Ai-1 of Agropyron intermedium. 390 ph1b ph1b homozygous F-3 progeny were screened using six co-dominant DNA markers (RFLP loci). 63 of the progeny (16%) were putative recombinants, showing dissociation of RFLP markers within the arm(s). Progeny tests of self-fertile putative recombinants confirmed the dissociation phenotypes observed in the F-3 progeny. No recombination could be confirmed in 117 F-3 progeny plants having the Ph1-allele (control population). Frequencies and distribution of chiasmata along the chromosome arm 7AS were analysed using additional RFLP markers. The patterns of recombination between the two homoeologous chromosomes were found similar to those reported for homologous recombination between the same markers on short arms of group 7 chromosomes of Triticeae.

AB Microsatellite and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers were used to identify molecular markers linked to the Yr15 gene which confer resistance to stripe rust (Puccina striiformis Westend) in wheat. By using near isogenic lines (NILs) for the Yr15 gene and a F-2 mapping population derived from crosses of these lines and phenotyped for resistance, we identified one microsatellite marker (GWM33) and one RAPD marker (OPA19(800)) linked to Yr15. Then, bulked segregant analysis was used in addition to the NILs to identify RAPD markers linked to the target gene. Using this approach, two RAPD markers linked to Yr15 were identified, one in coupling (UBC199(700)) and one in repulsion phase (UBC212(1200)). After Mapmaker linkage analysis on the F-2 population, the two closest markers were shown to be linked to Yr15 within a distance of about 12 cM. The recombination rates were recalculated using the maximum likelihood technique to take into account putative escaped individuals from the stripe rust resistance test and obtain unbiased distance estimates. As a result of this study, the stripe rust resistance gene Yr15 is surrounded by two flanking PCR markers, UBC199(700) and GWM33, at about 5 cM from each side.

AB The grain softness proteins or friabilins are known to be composed of three main components: puroindoline a, puroindoline b, and GSP-1. cDNAs for GSP-1 have previously been mapped to group-5 chromosomes and their location on chromosome 5D is closely linked to the grain hardness (Ha) locus of hexaploid wheat. A genomic DNA clone containing the GSP-1 gene (wGSP1-A1) from hexaploid wheat has been identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization as having originated from the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5A. A genomic clone containing the gene (wGSP1-D1) was also isolated from Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the D genome to bread wheat. There are no introns in the GSP-1 genes, and there is high sequence identity between wGSP1-A1 and wGSP1-D1 up to 1 kb 5' and 300 bp 3' to wGSP1-D1. However, regions further upstream and downstream of wGSP1-D1 share no significant sequence identity to corresponding sequences in wGSP1-A1. These regions therefore identified potentially valuable sequences for tracing the Ha locus through assaying polymorphic DNA sequences. The sequence from 300 to 500 bp 3' to wGSP1-D1 (wGSP1-D13) was mapped to the Ha locus in a mapping population. wGSP1-D13 was also tightly linked to genes for puroindoline a and puroindoline b which have been previously mapped to be at the Ha locus. In addition wGSP1-D13 was used to detect RFLPs between near isogenic soft and hard Falcon lines and in a random selection of soft and hard wheats.

AB Tapesia yallundae and Tapesia acuformis are the causal agents of eyespot, the major foot disease of cereals. Many authors have suggested that the two species differ in epidemiological behaviour, based on the later appearance of lesions with T. acuformis than with T. yallundae. However, the reasons for this difference in natural conditions are unclear in the absence of a method to distinguish the two species in the plant before the symptoms appear. Methods of detection [visual assessment, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test] and characterization (isolation on artificial medium, PCR test) were used to investigate the behaviour of Tapesia spp. in the held under various epidemiological conditions. The PCR test was used to determine infection dates and to identify the species involved early, in order to demonstrate that infection occurred at the same time for T. yallundae and T. acuformis. Symptoms of T. acuformis infection occurred later because the pathogen developed more slowly in the tissues. A triticonazole seed treatment was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the PCR test for estimating fungicidal effects. This molecular tool for determining the period of activity of the chemical and changes in the proportions of the two species of Tapesia involved in the disease was demonstrated to be accurate. The PCR test either had advantages over or was complementary to the other methods tested.

AB The 5' regions of chloroplast genes contain cis-acting regulatory elements including promoters, and determinants of RNA stability and translation. In this work I examined whether the 5' regions of the spinach psbB and the wheat psbA genes can drive the expression of an aadA reporter gene in chloroplasts of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas I reinhardtii. Both plant 5' sequences confer aadA-dependent, spectinomycin resistance on Escherichia coli, but not on the alga following integration into its chloroplast genome. Northern and run-on transcription analyses reveal that the plant promotors are active in C. reinhardtii but that the resulting chimeric transcripts are unstable. Therefore, the data suggest differences between higher plants and green algae with respect to the molecular mechanisms underlying plastid RNA metabolism.

AB Endosperm texture, i.e. the hardness or softness of the grain, is an important quality criterion in cereals because it determines many grain end-use properties. Grain softness is the dominant trait and is mainly controlled by the Hn locus on the short arm of chromosome 5D in hexaploid bread wheat. Genes for puroindoline a (Pinn-D1), puroindoline b (Pinb-D1), and grain softness related protein (Gsp-D1) have been shown to be linked to the Hn locus in different mapping populations and have been associated with the expression of grain softness. The study of the linkage relationships among these genes has been limited by the low level of polymorphism in the D genome of hexaploid Triticum aestivum. In the present study, a highly polymorphic Triticum monococcum mapping population was used to analyze linkage relationships among these three genes. Gsp-A(m)1 and Pina-A(m)1 were found to be completely linked and lie 0.14 cM distal to Pinb-A(m)1 in the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 5A(m). The tight genetic linkage among these three genes was paralleled by their physical proximity within a single 105-kb clone isolated from a T. monococcum bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. A restriction map of this BAC clone showed that Pina-A(m)1 is located between Pinb-A(m)1 and Gsp-A(m)1. Partial sequences of the T. monococcum genes showed a high degree of similarity with their T. aestivum counterparts (greater than or equal to 94%). Marker-assisted selection strategies based on the tight linkage among Ha-related genes are discussed.

AB When chromosomes are broken, the breakpoints become highly unstable and acquire the ability to fuse-with other broken ends. The breakpoints are, however, eventually stabilized, and, therefore, the broken chromosomes are transmitted to the daughter cells without further morphological change. This phenomenon, known as "healing of breakpoints", involves the addition of repetitive telomere sequences at the breakpoints by telomerase, the enzyme that normally synthesizes the telomere sequence at normal chromosome terminals. In many higher organisms, however, this property has not been well investigated. In this study, we examined the telomere sequences in wheat deletion lines with breakpoints on chromosome 1B. Lines that had breakpoints around the nucleolar organizer region were first selected on the basis of cytological observations, and the precise breakpoints were determined by mapping a fragment of rDNA and RFLP markers. In three lines - in addition to one previously reported - the DNA fragments encompassing the breakpoints were amplified by PCR using primers located in the rDNA and in telomere sequences. The DNA sequences provide insight into the properties of the telomerase activity at the breakpoints. The telomere sequences initiated from 2- to 4-nucleotide motifs in the original ribosomal DNA sequence which are also found in the repeat unit characteristic of telomere sequences. No specific sequences or structures were observed at or around the breakpoints. At all of the four breakpoints investigated, the newly synthesized telomere sequences contained considerable numbers of atypical telomere sequence units, particularly TTAGGG, which is the common unit of mammalian telomere sequences. Based on these results, we discuss the ability of plant telomerase to initiate the de novo synthesis of telomere sequences at internal breakpoints.

AB A DNA fragment containing the exons 16, 17 and intron 16 of the limit dextrinase gene was cloned using a 654 bp cDNA as probe. Intron 16 contained a simple sequence repeat (microsatellite). PCR primers were designed to amplify that microsatellite. Using these primers, the limit dextrinase gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1 (7H) using 150 DH lines from the Steptoe x Morex mapping population. This gene co-segregated with the RFLP marker ABC154A. QTLs for malt extract, alpha-amylase activity, diastatic power and fine-coarse difference previously mapped in the North American Barley Genome Mapping Project have been located in this chromosome region. Five limit dextrinase alleles were detected in 31 barley cultivars with a PIC of 0.75. Ten different alleles/genes were identified in 23 uncultivated Hordeum species or subspecies using these microsatellite primers. The primers also amplified one fragment from wheat and two from oat. This microsatellite should be useful for marker-assisted selection for malting quality.

AB Biodiversity, the substrate for natural selection and adaptation to the environment, is of foremost importance in species conservation. Genomics, the study of the structure and function of complex genomes, can be applied to the assessment of the genetic component of biodiversity in animals and plants. Genomic analysis within the genus Hordeum, in cultivars of a vulgare and in wild accessions of H. spontaneum, was performed by different types of molecular markers, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and long primer-polymerase chain reaction (LP-PCR), and simple sequence repeats (SSR). The aim of this approach was to compare the correlation existing between genotypic variation at specific regions of the genome, as targeted with the different probes obtained from stress-responsive genes, and phenotypic variation, as shown by adaptation to different environments and climates. H. vulgare cultivars with contrasting growth habits (spring or winter) and H. spontaneum accessions adapted to different locations in Israel have been analysed. The results showed the existence of some tight associations between adaptive traits and markers (RFLP, LP-PCR) derived from specific genes induced in response to environmental stress. The correlation between adaptive phenotypes and genetic variation obtained with these markers was similar to that observed with SSRs. However, a considerable amount of the global genetic variation (83% in H. vulgare and 65% in H. spontaneum) seemed to have no direct correlation with the particular genetic traits involved in differentiating the individuals. Molecular markers are therefore a useful tool to target genomic regions involved in adaptation to the environment.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the major parameters controlling DNA delivery by particle bombardment to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) scutellum and inflorescence tissue. The main factors studied were the DNA/gold precipitation process, bombardment parameters and tissue culture variables. Efficiency of DNA (uidA gene) delivery was assessed by scoring transient GUS expression in bombarded tissues. Of the parameters analysed, amount of plasmid DNA, spermidine concentration, presence of Catt ions, calcium chloride concentration, amount of gold particles, gold particle size, acceleration pressure, chamber vacuum pressure, bombardment distance, osmotic conditioning of tissues and type of auxin had a clear influence on transient gene expression. A bombardment procedure suitable for elite wheat varieties was developed which allowed high-efficiency DNA delivery combined with reduced damage to target tissues.

AB The wheat line H960642 is a homozygous wheat- Thinopyrum intermedium translocation line with resistance to BYDV by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and RFLP analysis. The genomic DNA of Th. intermedium was used as a probe, and common wheat genomic DNA as a blocking in GISH experiment. The results showed that the chromosome segments of Th. intermedium were transferred to the distal end of a pair of wheat chromosomes. RFLP analysis indicated that the translocation line H960642 is a T7DS.7DL-7XL translocation by using 8 probes mapped on the homoeologous group 7 in wheat. The translocation breakpoint is located between Xps680 and Xpsr965 about 90-99 cM from the centromere. The RFLP markers psr680 and psr687 were closely linked with the BYDV resistance gene. The gene is located on the distal end of 7XL around Xpsr680 and Xpsr687.

AB Rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome 2R carries several genes for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, which could be used in wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) improvement. To make these genes accessible in breeding, translocations of 2R to wheat chromosome 2B have been generated. To compensate for the lack of clearly identifiable cytological markers on chromosome 2R, random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) were employed as markers. Wheat lines homozygous for centric translocations 2RS.2BL and 2BS.2RL were screened with 489 primers, resulting in 65 clear and reproducible RAPD polymorphisms. To assign the polymorphisms to individual arms of chromosomes 2R and 2B, the arms of the translocations were separated by centric misdivision and the resulting progeny with desired chromosome constructs were rescreened, As a result, 17 markers were assigned to chromosome arm 2RS, 15 to 2RL, and the remaining 33 most likely located on 2B, Preliminary mapping studies (not shown here) have indicated that some of these markers are evenly distributed along the chromosome arms. These markers should be useful for the localization of translocation breakpoints in recombinant wheat-rye chromosomes.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko, is an economic pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) in some western growing regions. Sources of resistance occur within the wheat gene pool, but there are also high levels of resistance in wheat relatives, including rye (Secale cereale L.). An F-2 population between PI 386156, a Russian wheat aphid-resistant triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) from Russia and NE88T222, a susceptible triticale, was used to examine the inheritance of resistance. Five distinct classes of reaction to the RWA were observed, suggesting this trait is not controlled by a single dominant gene in this population. Bulked segregant analysis was performed with DNA from plants representing the most resistant ('R') and most susceptible ('S') classes. A co-dominant marker amplified by primer OP-M09 explained more than 55% of the variation observed for resistance. Sequencing results revealed a deletion in the 'S' parent relative to the 'R' parent. Using a set of wheat-rye addition lines, we mapped the target fragment to chromosome 4R, which has previously been identified as the critical chromosome for RWA resistance from PI 386156 and other Russian triticales.

AB \Chromosome 3A of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) cultivar 'Wichita' (WI) was previously found to differ from that of 'Cheyenne' (CNN) for genes affecting a number of agronomically important traits such as grain yield (GYLD), kernel number spike(-1) (KPS), 1000-kernel weight (TKWT), spike number m(-1) (SPSM), grain, volume weight (GVWT), plant height (PHT), and anthesis date (influenced by Eps locus). This study was designed to map the Eps locus and to identify regions of chromosome 3A of wheat associated with agronomic traits, A population of 3A recombinant inbred chromosome lines (RICLs-3A) was previously evaluated in replicated field trials, Thirteen RFLPs and one morphological marker locus, Eps, were used to develop a genetic linkage map and to identify QTLs associated with agronomic traits, Individual loci explained from 8.9 to 38.2% of the total phenotypic variation for the measured traits. The major locus Eps was mapped distal to an RFLP marker locus Xcdo549 on the short arm of chromosome 3A and explained 38.2% of the total phenotypic variation for PHT, and 17.4% for both KPS and TKWT. Additional QTLs for PHT, TKWT, and KPS were identified on the chromosome. A QTL for SPSM on the long arm of chromosome 3A was tightly linked to QTL for PHT and KPS, QTLs fur GYLD were identified only in a few individual environments whereas no QTL was detected for GVWT, No epistasis was detected between markers associated with QTLs, The QTLs identified across environments were consistent in all or most environments, hence should be useful in future marker assisted selection programs for breeding wheat cultivars.

AB We have developed a DNA-mediated transformation system for the entomopathogenic fungus Paecilomyces fumosoroseus based on resistance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium. The resistance is provided by the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and is under the control of the Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter and terminator sequences. Frequencies of up to 110 transformants/mu g of linearized plasmid DNA were obtained aided by the addition of the nuclease inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). The transformants were stable for drug resistance for five consecutive vegetative transfers under selective and nonselective conditions. Southern analyses revealed that the transforming DNA integrated into the P. fumosoroseus genome in single and multiple copies. Single-copy integration events were generated with higher efficiency by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI), although rates of transformation were generally not as high as those treatments containing ATA. Two mutant strains altered in sporulation capacity and virulence toward the Russian wheat aphid were recovered using this approach. This transformation-based manipulation of P. fumosoroseus will facilitate insertional mutagenesis and the functional analysis of various genes.

AB A new Zeta class glutathione S-transferases (GST) gene, pGST, has been cloned from wheat for the first time by the differential display PCR (DD-PCR) method. The genomic sequence of pGST, TA-GSTZ1, contains nine exons that encode a polypeptide of 213 amino acids and eight introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of TA-GSTZ1 as well as the exon:intron placement are more similar to the GSTs of the Zeta class than to the two wheat GSTs reported earlier. The pGST cDNA gene product expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography showed typical Zeta class GST and glutathione peroxidase activities. Sequence polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of TA-GSTZ1 gene in wheat has been discovered. In this study, an 89 bp sequence is present in the 3' UTR of TA-GSTZ1 gene in 16 wheat cultivars but absent in the other five. Although the biological importance of this polymorphism is unknown, it can be useful as a genetic marker in wheat breeding. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A gene conditioning hairy leaf sheath character, which was derived from Hordeum bulbosum and designated Hs(b), was mapped using a cross between Hordeum vulgare and a H. vulgare/H. bulbosum recombinant line. The Hs(b) locus was tagged relative to eight RFLP markers detecting three loci on the distal part of chromosome 4HL. The map position suggests that Hs(b) of H. bulbosum is homoeologous to the gene Hp1 of rye (Secale cereale), which pleiotropically governs the traits hairy leaf sheath and hairy peduncle. It is proposed that the recombination break point between H. vulgare and H. bulbosum chromosomes occured at a position homoeologous compared with the 4L/5L translocation in Triticeae genomes, and may reflect a hot spot for chromosome breakage.

AB Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with multiple probes, consisting of highly repeated DNA sequences (pSc119.2 and pAs1) and of a low-copy, 3BS-specific RFLP sequence (PSR907), enabled determination of the physical position of the wheat-alien breakpoints (BPs) along the 3BS and 3DS arms of common wheat recombinant lines. These lines harbour 3S(1)S Aegilops longissima segments containing the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm13. In all 3B recombinants, the wheat-Aegilops longissima physical BPs lie within the interval separating the two most distal of the three pSc119.2 3BS sites. In all such recombinants a telomeric segment, containing the most distal of the pSc119.2 3BS sites, was in fact replaced by a homoeologous Ae. longissima segment, marked by characteristic pSc119.2 hybridization sites. Employment of the PSR907 RFLP probe as a FISH marker allowed to resolve further the critical region in the various 3B recombinant lines. Three of them, like the control common wheat, exhibited between the two most distal pSc119.2 sites a single PSR907 FISH site, which was missing in a fourth recombinant line. The amount of alien chromatin can thus be estimated to represent around 20% of the recombinant arm in the three former lines and a maximum of 27% in the latter. A similar physical length was calculated for the alien segment contained in three 3D recombinants, all characterized by the presence of the Ae. longissima pSc119.2 sites distal to the nearly telomeric pAs1 sites of normal 3DS. Comparison between the FISH-based maps and previously developed RFLP maps of the 3BS-3S(1)S and 3DS-3S(1)S arms revealed substantial differences between physical and genetic map positions of the wheat-alien BPs and of molecular markers associated with the critical chromosomal portions.

AB Cell autonomous anthocyanin pigmentation, produced by the anthocyanin regulatory genes B and Cl controlled by the constitutive CaMV35s promoter (pBC1-7), was used to optimize biolistic gene delivery into embryogenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv 'Chris') scutellum cultures, intensely pigmented callus cells were observed 24 h postbombardment but these cells did not continue to divide and were developmentally terminal. A population of nonexpressing cells generated transgenic sectors which showed light-dependent anthocyanin pigmentation. Anthocyanin pigmentation was suppressed in regenerating shoot cultures but reverted to light-dependent production in the pericarp of developing seeds. Similarly, following micro-targeted gene delivery into epical meristems, anthocyanin production was developmentally suppressed in leaf base meristems but prominent anthocyanin sectors developed in mature tissues beyond this region and persisted throughout leaf growth. In three developmental situations, callus proliferation. plant regeneration, and leaf growth, perpetuation of cells with anthocyanin regulator genes under the control of constitutive promoters was dependent on a higher level of regulation to suppress pigmentation at developmentally sensitive stages of meristematic activity. These findings provide additional evidence that the anthocyanin regulatory genes may be responsive to a variety of developmental and environmental stimuli.

We have expressed GFP in the entomopathogenic fungus Paecilomyces fumosoroseus through co-transformation with a vector that confers resistance to glufosinate ammonium, All cell types express GFP and were readily detected by fluorescence microscopy. No correlation was observed between the amount of fluorescence and the pattern of vector integration as observed by Southern analysis. Fluorescent hyphae and conidia were easily distinguished on two insect hosts, the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia, and the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, and blastospores were also detected in the hemolymph of the diamondback moth. GFP-tagged strains of P. fumosoroseus can be used to study the developmental fate of the fungus within its insect hosts.

AB Lipofection of nondividing cells is inefficient because much of the transfected DNA is retained in endosomes, and that which escapes to the cytoplasm enters the nucleus at low rates. To improve the final rate-limiting step of nuclear import, we conjugated a nonclassical nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing the M9 sequence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, to a cationic peptide scaffold derived from a scrambled sequence of the SV40 T-antigen consensus NLS (ScT). The ScT was added to improve DNA binding of the M9 sequence. Lipofection of confluent endothelium with plasmid complexed with the M9-ScT conjugate resulted in 83% transfection and a 63-fold increase in marker gene expression. The M9-ScT conjugate localized fluorescent plasmid into the nucleus of permeabilized cells, and addition of the nuclear pore blocker wheat germ agglutinin prevented nuclear import. This method of gene transfer may lead to viral- and lipid-free transfection of nondividing cells.

AB An Aegilops turcomanica-typical gliadin was discovered in sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) patterns of ethanol-soluble seed proteins from wheat lines Tr. 576, 482 and 492, which had been derived from a direct cross of Ar. turcomanica and Triticum aestivum and which revealed powdery mildew resistance due to a putative Ar. turcomanica-introgression. This Ar. turcomanica-derived gliadin was tested for its suitability as biochemical marker. For this purpose, doubled-haploid lines were produced via anther culture from crosses of Tr. 482 and Tr. 492 with actual winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines. Until now, 173 lines with Ar. turcomanica-gene(s) have been selected from 297 doubled haploid wheat lines.

AB The stability and heritability of three marker genes was investigated in a population of twelve independent transgenic cereal lines (six wheat and six tritordeum). Integration patterns, inheritance of structural transgenes and inheritance of expression were analysed in the T-0 and T-1 generations for all 12 lines. Transmission and expression were analysed in the T-2 generation for 9 lines and in the T-3 generation for the six wheat lines. Inheritance of integration patterns was highly stable, and transmission of the transgenes and inheritance of their expression followed Mendelian ratios in the majority of lines. A gradual reduction in uidA expression was observed over three generations, which was not accompanied by a similar reduction in bar expression. Some unexpected phenomena associated with transgene inheritance were also observed and are discussed.

AB We present the first genetic map of wild rice (Zizania palustris L., 2n=2x=30), a native aquatic grain of northern North America. This map is composed principally of previously mapped RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) genetic markers from rice (Oryza sativa 2n=2x=24). The map is important as a foundation for genetic and crop improvement studies as well as a reference for genome organization comparisons among species of Gramineae. A comparative mapping approach with rice is especially useful because wild rice is grouped in the same subfamily, Oryzoideae, and no other mapping comparison has yet been made within the subfamily. As rice is the reference point for mapping and gene cloning in cereals, establishing a consensus map within the subfamily identifies conserved and unique regions. The genomes of wild rice and rice differ in total DNA content (wild rice has twice that of rice) and the number of chromosome pairs (wild rice=15 Versus rice=12). The wild rice linkage map reported herein consists of 121 RFLP markers on 16 linkage groups spanning 1805 cM. Two linkage groups consist of only two markers. Colinear markers were found representing all rice linkage groups except #12. The majority of rice loci mapped to colinearly arranged arrays in wild rice (92 of 118). Features of the map include duplication of portions of three rice linkage groups and three possible translocations. The map gives basic information on the composition of the wild rice genome and provides tools to assist in the domestication of this important food source.

AB Pseudomonas chlororaphis MA 342 is a potent biocontrol agent that can be used against several seed-borne diseases of cereal crops, including net blotch of barley caused by the fungus Drechslera ter es. In this study, strain MA 342 was tagged with the gfp gene (encoding the green fluorescent protein) in order to study the fate of cells after seed inoculation. The gfp-tagged strain, MA 342G2, had the same biocontrol efficacy as the wild type when it was applied at high cell concentrations to seeds but was less effective at lower cell concentrations. By comparing cell counts determined by microscopy to the number of CFU, we found that the number of culturable cells was significantly lower than the total number of bacteria on seeds which were inoculated and dried for 20 h. Confocal microscopy and epifluorescence stereomicroscopy were used to determine the pattern of MA 342G2 colonization and cell aggregation on barley seeds. Immediately after inoculation of seeds, bacteria were found mainly under the seed glume, and there was no particular aggregation pattern. However, after the seeds were sown, irregularly distributed areas of bacterial aggregation were found, which reflected epiphytic colonization of glume cells. There was a trend towards bacterial aggregation near the embryo but never within the embryo. Bacterial aggregates were regularly found in the groove of each seed formed by the base of the coleoptile and the scutellum. Based on these results, we suggest that h ZA 342 colocalizes with the pathogen D. teres, which facilitates the action of the fungistatic compound(s) produced by this strain.

AB Inheritance of genes for hairy auricles and hairy leaf sheath of Ae. tauschii in hexaploid wheat backgrounds (synthetic hexaploid wheat and common wheat varieties) was analyzed. The results indicated that hairy auricles and hairy leaf sheath of Ae. tauschii can be transferred and are expressed in hexaploid wheat. In a synthetic hexaploid wheat ('Ae. tauschii' 188) hairy auricles was proved to be controlled by a single dominant gene derived from Ae. tauschii, which was different from the Pa gene located on chromosome 4BS of common wheat. The hairy leaf sheath phenotype of 'Altar 84/Ae. tauschii 188' was also controlled by a single dominant gene derived from Ae. tauschii, which is obviously different from the Hls gene in T. dicoccoides. We suggest to designate the Ae. tauschii genes for hairy auricles and hairy leaf sheath as Pa2 and Hls2, respectively; such genes could be used as useful genetic markers in common wheat.

AB Wide crosses in wheat have now been performed for over 100 years. In that time, approximately 100 genes have been transferred for numerous traits, including biotic and abiotic stresses and value-added traits. Resistance genes from alien sources do become defeated with rime, so the search for additional variability must continue. Recent screening of alien species has identified accessions with multiple pest resistance plus combinations of pest resistance and value-added traits. The majority of existing induced recombinants are of a noncompensating type with considerable linkage drag, so sequential useage of Ph mutants is recommended to produce smaller interstitial recombinants. Molecular methods including GISH, RAPD, RFLP, AFLP, and microsatellites, are being widely used to identify integrated alien chromosomes, chromosome segments, and genes.

AB Interspecific hybridization of Lilium longiflorum (L) with Asiatic (A) lily hybrids results in so-called LA-hybrids. Some of these hybrids produce 2n-pollen, which were used to perform crosses on Asiatic and Oriental (O) hybrids, resulting in ALA- and OLA-hybrids. Recombination between homoeologous chromosomes (introgression) and the mechanism of 2n-pollen formation in these hybrids were studied using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). A clear differentiation between the chromosomes of L. longiflorum, Asiatic, and Oriental hybrids was observed in four ALA- and one OLA-hybrid using GISH. Two ALA-hybrids showed 3 and 5 recombinant chromosomes with a total of 5 and 10 crossover sites per hybrid, respectively. These occurred at random positions on the chromosomes. The number and the location of the rDNA-sites were determined using in situ hybridization and provided a tool, the FISH-marker, for identifying the NOR-bearing chromosomes in the lily hybrids. Evidence for the occurrence of the FDR-mechanism (first division restitution) of 2n-pollen formation in the LA-hybrids was obtained on the basis of absence of homologous chromosomes of L, longiflorum in the ALA- and OLA-hybrids.

AB Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were used to determine the genetic structure of Australian field populations of the barley scald pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis. Fungal isolates were collected by hierarchical sampling from five naturally infected barley fields in different geographic locations during a single growing season. Genetic variation was high in Australian R. secalis populations. Among the 265 fungal isolates analyzed, 214 distinct genotypes were identified. Average genotype diversity within a field population was 65% of its theoretical maximum. Nei's average gene diversity across seven RFLP loci was 0.54. The majority (76%) of gene diversity was distributed within sampling site areas measuring approximate to 1 m(2); 19% of gene diversity was distributed among sampling sites within fields; and 5% of gene diversity was distributed among fields. Fungal populations from different locations differed significantly both in allele frequencies and genotype diversities. The degree of genetic differentiation was significantly correlated with geographic distance between populations. Our results suggest that the R. secalis population in Western Australia has a different genetic structure than populations in Victoria and South Australia.

In eight independent experiments, linearized DNA integrated in the ds or ss form with a high efficiency of up to 14% for 1-ssDNA. Molecular analyses by Southern blotting showed that all DNA forms gave a similar complicated integration pattern of the bar gene.

Triticum speltoides, a diploid relative of wheat. A segregating population of 96 F-2 plants derived from a cross between the resistant line ThatcherLr35 and the susceptible variety Frisal was analysed. Out of 80 RFLP probes previously mapped on wheat chromosome 2B, 51 detected a polymorphism between the parents of the cross. Three of them were completely Linked with the resistance gene Lr35. The co-segregating probe BCD260 was converted into a PCR-based sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker. A set of 48 different breeding lines derived from several European breeding programs was tested with the STS marker. None of these lines has a donor for Lr35 in its pedigree and all of them reacted negatively with the STS marker. As no leaf rust races virulent on Lr35 have been found in different areas of the world, the STS marker for the Lr35 resistance gene is of great value to support the introgression of this gene in combination with other leaf rust (Lr) genes into breeding material by marker-assisted selection.

AB The two recessive dwarfing mutants gai (GA-ins) and gal (GA-less), differing in their response to exogenously applied gibberellic acid (GA,), were mapped in the centromere region and on the long arm, respectively, of the barley chromosome 2H. The gene gal, which determines reduced plant height and GA insensitivity pleiotropically, was found to co-segregate with the two RFLP markers Xmwg2058 and Xmwg2287. Both markers are known to map close to the centromere. The GA-sensitive dwarfing gene gal was found to be linked to the three co-segregating RFLP markers Xmwg581, Xmwg882 and Xmwg2212 (proximal) and XksuG5 (distal) by 3.6 and 9.5. cM, respectively. The distance between the two mutant loci was estimated to be about 55 cM. Homoeologous relationships between the dwarfing genes within the Triticeae are discussed.

AB The effects of an antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens strain (F113) carrying the marker gene cassette lacZY and a marked, non-producing strain (F113G22) on the uptake of nitrogen from N-15-enriched organic residues incorporated into a sandy soil were investigated in microcosm studies. Strain F113 produces the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), whilst its modified derivative strain F113G22 has DAPG production deleted by Tn5 mutagenesis. Uptake of nitrogen by wheat (Triticum aestivum) from N-15-enriched organic residues was estimated using stable isotope-ratio mass spectrometry of shoot and root material of 17-day-old plants. In addition, plant growth and active microbial biomass in soil were monitored. In contrast to results obtained in our previous study on pea (Pisum sativum), it was found that in wheat, inoculation with either strain F113 or F113G22 decreased the proportion of nitrogen derived from N-15-labelled organic residues incorporated into soil as compared to non-inoculated controls. It is therefore suggested that these strains decreased mineralization of organic residues in the rhizosphere of wheat, making less inorganic N (N-15) available for plant uptake. The results of this study indicate that the effects of introduced Pseudomonas fluorescens strains on nitrogen mineralization in the rhizosphere are plant-species dependent, and highlight the importance of testing microbial inocula on a range of plant species.

AB Pseudomonas chloroaphis 3732 RN-L11 is a genetically modified bacterial strain that contains the lacZY marker genes in its chromosome. This strain, is known to be it vigorous colonizer of plant roots and rhizosphere soil, and has been used as a model to evaluate survival and persistence of field-released genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs). However, the possibility that strain 3732 RN-L11 may also colonize internal plant tissues has not previously been investigated. Using spring wheat as a model system, we studied the ability of strain 3732 RN-L11 to colonize external and internal root tissues after seed inoculation. Strain 3732 RN-L11 was recovered from rhizosphere soil of 28-, 42-, and 56-day-old seedlings with mean population sizes of 3.3 x 10(5), 7.5 x 10(4), and 2.2 x 105 CFU.g(-1) fresh root tissue, respectively. Tn addition, this strain was consistently recovered from surface-sterilized root tissues of 28- to 56-day-old seedlings with mean population sizes of 1.0 x 10(2) to 6.2 x 10(3) CFU.g(-1) fresh root tissue. Our results indicate that evaluation of plant-associated GEM populations after field release should include all possible colonization niches, including internal plant tissues.

TI Loci controlling resistance to high plains virus and wheat streak mosaic

SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANT-VIRUSES; GENE; DISEASE; MARKERS
AB High Plains disease has the potential to cause significant yield loss in susceptible corn (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes, especially in the central and western USA. The primary causal agent, High Plains virus (HPV), is vectored by wheat curl mite (WCM; Aceria tossichella Keifer), which is also the vector of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). In general, the two diseases occur together as a mixed infection in the field. The objective of this research was to characterize the inheritance of HPV and WSMV resistance using B73 (resistant to HPV and WSMV) X Mo17 (moderately susceptible to HPV and WSMV) recombinant inbred lines. A population of 129 recombinant inbred lines scored for 167 molecular markers was used to evaluate resistance to WSMV and to a mixed infection of WSMV and HPV. Loci conferring resistance to systemic movement of WSMV in plants mapped to chromosomes 3, 6, and 10, consistent with the map position of wsm2, wsm1, and wsm3, respectively. Major genes for resistance to systemic spread of HPV in doubly infected plants mapped to chromosomes 3 and 6, coincident or tightly linked with the WSMV resistance loci. Analysis of doubly infected plants revealed that chromosome 6 had a major effect on HPV resistance, consistent with our previous analysis of B73 X W64A and B73 x Wf9 populations. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting resistance to localized symptom development mapped to chromosomes 4 (umc66), 5 (bn15.40), and 6 (umc85), and accounted for 24% of the phenotypic variation. Localized symptoms may reflect the amount of mite feeding or the extent of virus spread at the point of infection. Identification of cosegregating markers may facilitate selection for HPV and WSMV resistance in corn breeding programs.

AB We have constructed a 1736-locus maize genome map containing 1156 loci probed by cDNAs, 545 probed by random genomic clones, 16 by simple sequence repeats (SSRs). 14 by isozymes, and 5 by anonymous clones. Sequence information is available for 56% of the loci with 66% of the sequenced loci assigned functions. A total of 596 new ESTs were mapped from a B73 library of 5-wk-old shoots. The map contains 237 loci probed by barley, oat, wheat, rice, or tripsacum clones, which serve as grass genome reference points in comparisons between maize and other grass maps. Ninety core markers selected for low copy number, high polymorphism. and even spacing along the chromosome delineate the 100 bins on the map. The average bin size is 17 cM. Use of bill assignments enables comparison among different maize mapping populations and experiments including those involving cytogenetic stocks, mutants, or quantitative trait loci. Integration of nonmaize markers in the map extends the resources available for gene discovery beyond the boundaries of maize mapping information into the expanse of map, sequence, and phenotype information from other grass species. This map provides a foundation for numerous basic and applied investigations including studies of gene organization, gene and genome evolution, targeted cloning, and dissection of complex traits.

AB Powdery mildew is an important disease in most of the wheat production areas of the world. The resistance gene Pm21 (6AL/6VS translocation) derived from Haynaldia villosa confers resistance to all available isolates of Erysiphe (Blumeria) graminis f. sp. tritici in China and Europe. The objective of this study was to develop fast and reliable sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers linked to the Pm21 gene. A random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker for Pm21, OPH17(1400), was converted to SCAR markers after sequencing the two ends of the polymorphic DNA fragment. Two SCAR markers, SCAR(1265) and SCAR(1400), were developed to detect the Pm21 gene in different genetic backgrounds. The specific SCAR(1265) marker enable large-scale accurate screening for the presence/absence of Pm21 allele.

AB Potential polymorphism of an (AT)(n) microsatellite at the 3' end of waxy genes in bread wheat was examined. Primers were designed from a published cDNA sequence of a wheat waxy gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA from 135 mainly Australian cultivars revealed eight alleles on chromosome 7A. This polymorphic microsatellite is a potential codominant marker for the Wx-A1 locus in breeding programmes. A distinguishable fragment was also amplified from chromosome 7D. This fragment was absent where a plant was null for the waxy gene on chromosome 7D, being a dominant marker for the Wx-D1 locus. The primers were also useful for amplifying genomic DNA from barley, rye and triticale and can be used to detect potential polymorphism in these species.

AB Aegilops tauschii is the diploid D-genome progenitor of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). A genetic linkage map of the Ae. tauschii genome was constructed, composed of 546 loci. One hundred and thirty two loci (24%) gave distorted segregation ratios. Sixty nine probes (13%) detected multiple copies in the genome. One hundred and twenty three of the 157 markers shared between the Ae. tauschii genetic and T. aestivum physical maps were colinear. The discrepancy in the order of five markers on the Ae. tauschii 3DS genetic map versus the T. aestivum 3D physical map indicated a possible inversion. Further work is needed to verify the discrepancies in the order of markers on the 4D, 5D and 7D Ae. tauschii genetic maps versus the physical and genetic maps of T. aestivum. Using common markers, 164 agronomically important genes were assigned to specific regions on Ae. tauschii linkage, and T. aestivum physical, maps. This information may be useful for map-based cloning and marker-assisted plant breeding.

ID WHEAT; GENE; MAPS; AMPLIFICATION
AB We sequenced and genetically mapped the myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) genes of maize (Zea mays L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L). Our objective was to determine whether the genetic map positions of these MIPS loci correspond with the location of the low phtyic acid 1 (Ipa1) mutations that were previously identified in maize and barley. Seven MIPS-homologous sequences were mapped to positions on maize chromosomes 1S, 4L, 5S, 6S, 8L, 9S and 9L, and a similar number of divergent MIPS sequences were amplified from maize. To the extent that we can compare across different genetic mapping populations, the position of the MIPS gene on maize chromosome 1S is identical to the location of the maize Ipa1 mutation. However, only one MIPS sequence was identified in barley and this gene was mapped to a locus on chromosome 4H that is separate from the barley Ipa1 mutation on chromosome 2H. Although several RFLP markers linked to the barley MIPS gene on chromosome 4H also detect loci near barley Ipa1 on chromosome 2H, our experiments failed to reveal a second MIPS gene that could be associated with the barley Ipa1 mutation. Therefore, genetic mapping results from this study support the MIPS candidate-gene hypothesis for maize Ipa1, but do not support the MIPS candidate-gene-hypothesis for barley Ipa1. These opposing results contradict the hypothesis that maize Ipa1 and barley Ipa1 are mutations of orthologous genes, which is suggested by the similar biochemical phenotypes of these mutants. Yet, comparisons of RFLP mapping studies show loci that are homologous between maize chromosome 1S, barley chromosome 4H and barley chromosome 2H, including regions flanking the respective MIPS and/or Ipa1 loci. This putative relationship, between the regions flanking the Ipa1 mutations on maize 1S and barley 2H, also supports the assertion that these mutations are orthologous despite contradictory results between our maize and barley candidate-gene experiments.

AB PCR products from regions corresponding to sequences hybridising to wheat RFLP probes were sequenced in order to establish the level of DNA sequence variation among adapted wheat genotypes. Hexaploid bread wheat shows a very low rate of nucleotide polymorphism, approximately 1 polymorphic nucleotide per 1000 basepairs. Differences in PCR product length can be exploited to design genome-specific amplicons, which may have use in gene tagging or in diagnostic applications. Interpretation of results may be complicated by the simultaneous amplification of orthologous and paralogous sequences. These findings have significant implications for the use of STS markers in wheat and other polyploid species.

AB Three lines of the tetraploid wheat Aegilops ventricosa Tausch (2n = 4x = 28), which contains good resistance to eyespot, were analysed using fluorescent insitu hybridization. Probes used included rDNA, cloned repeated sequences from wheat and rye, simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) and total genomic DNA. The banding patterns produced could be used to distinguish most chromosome arms and will aid in the identification of Ac. ventricosa chromosomes or chromosome segments in breeding programmes. All lines had a single major 18S-25S rDNA site, the nucleolar organizing region (NOR) in chromosome 5N and several minor sites of 18S-25S rDNA and 5S rDNA. A 1NL.3DL, 1NS.3DS translocation was identified, and other minor differences were found between the lines.

AB This study was undertaken with a view to tag gene(s) controlling grain protein content (GPC) using molecular markers in bread wheat. For this purpose, the genotype PH 132 with high protein content (13.5%) was crossed with genotype WL711 with significantly lower protein content (9.7%), and 100 RILs were derived. These RILs showed normal distribution for protein content. The parental genotypes were analysed with 232 STMS primer pairs for detection of polymorphism. Of these, 167 primer pairs gave scorable amplification products, and 57 detected polymorphism between the parents. Using each of these 57 primer pairs, we carried out bulked segregant analysis on RILs representing the two extremes of the distribution. One primer pair for the locus wmc41 showed association with protein content. This was further confirmed through selective genotyping. The co-segregation data on the molecular marker (I wmc41) and protein content on 100 RILs was analysed by means of a single-marker linear regression approach. Significant regression suggested linkage between wcm41 and a QTL (designated as QGpc.ccsu-2D.) for protein content. The results showed that this marker-linked QTL accounted for 18.73% of the variation for protein content between the parents. The marker has been located on chromosome arm 2DL using nulli-tetrasomic lines and two ditelocentric stocks for chromosome 2D.

ID TUMEFACIENS; PLANTS; CELLS
AB silicon carbide fibers have been used for causing wounds in the immature wheat embryos for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Immature embryos were put in a 5% silicon carbide fiber (SCF) suspension and vortexed for 2 or 3 min followed by cocultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404. The strain harboured the binary vectors pBI121 and pTOK233 which contained selectable marker genes and gus as the reporter gene. Agrobacterium-infected explants were stained for GUS activity. Without wounding the GUS expression was observed in 2.4% of the embryo, while 33.3% of the embryos showed GUS expression after wounding with SCF for 2 min. The binary vector pBI121 showed better response than pTOK233 for GUS expression. We propose that SCFs can be used for wounding to improve frequency of transformation by disarmed Agrobacterium strains.

AB Variation and genetic control of seed protein in foxtail millet (Setaria italica) were studied using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Variation in the electrophoregram of the total seed protein were detected in the range between 20 and 30 kDa which is derived from the polymorphism of five prolamin bands. The segregation for each of the bands in F-2 seeds showed that these bands are governed by seven alleles at two loci, Pro1 and Pro2, which are not linked to one another. Among 271 local cultivars examined, eight out often possible genotypes were observed. With its level of diversity comparable to that of isozymes, the alleles conferring prolamin polymorphism are useful genetic markers.

AB We have identified two loci linked to aluminum (Al) tolerance in the maize inbred line Cat-100-6 by means of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA). A segregating population F-2 was obtained from a cross between Cat-100-6 (Al tolerant) x S1587-17 (Al sensitive) parents. Subsequently two DNA bulks of individuals, displaying a contrasting Al tolerance trait were generated from F-2. From a total of 158 markers used, 30 markers were identified showing polymorphism between parents and bulks. The segregation results derived from the hybridization from these 30 markers and 56 individuals from F-2 revealed 10 markers cosegregating with the Al tolerance which were located in two linkage groups. The linkage groups were composed of 6 and 4 markers, and they were mapped on the short arm of chromosomes 6 and 10, respectively. From these observations, we deduce that two loci are involved in this trait in Cat-100-6 line. QGENE software was used to study the correlation between these two loci and the trait for aluminum tolerance. The results indicate that the locus on chromosome 10 has the stronger effect, and it is responsible for the major part of the variability of the trait.

AB The presence of a sensory component in the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve (PhB), including its peripheral distribution and central projection, was studied by denervation and tracer experiments in the cat. The distribution of nerve fibers immunoreactive to protein gene product 9.5, a sensitive neuronal marker; calcitonin gene-related peptide; and substance P in the pharyngeal epithelium was analyzed in both intact animals and animals subjected to partial denervation by means of sectioning two of the three nerve trunks, the glossopharyngeal nerve, the superior laryngeal nerve, and the PhB, while leaving one intact. The results of this study show that the glossopharyngeal nerve and superior laryngeal nerve carry nerve fibers to the pharyngeal epithelium rostral and caudal to the middle level of the epiglottis, respectively, whereas the PhB carries nerve fibers to the mesopharyngeal epithelium. Tracer experiments, by applying wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase to the PhB, demonstrated retrogradely labeled primary sensory neurons in the jugular ganglion and transganglionic labeling of terminals in the interstitial subnucleus of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. These results indicate that the PhB contains a sensory component that originates from the jugular ganglion, innervates the mesopharyngeal epithelium, and projects to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius.

AB Boron toxicity has been recognised as an important problem limiting production in the low-rainfall regions of southern Australia, West Asia and North Africa. Genetic variation for boron toxicity tolerance in barley has been characterised but the mode of inheritance and the location of genes controlling tolerance were not previously known. A population of 150 doubled-haploid lines from a cross between a boron toxicity tolerant Algerian landrace, Sahara 3771, and the intolerant Australian cultivar Clipper was screened in four tolerance assays. An RFLP linkage map of the Clipper x Sahara population was used to identify chromosomal regions associated with boron tolerance in barley. Interval regression-mapping allowed the detection of four chromosomal regions involved in the boron tolerance traits measured. A region on chromosome 2H was associated with leaf-symptom expression, a region on chromosome 3H was associated with a reduction of the affect of boron toxicity on root growth suppression, a region on chromosome 6H was associated with reduced boron uptake, and a region on chromosome 4H was also associated with the control of boron uptake as well as being associated with root-length response, dry matter production and symptom expression. The benefits and potential of marker-assisted selection for boron toxicity tolerance are discussed.

AB A chimeric stilbene synthase (sts)-gene was transferred into wheat. Stilbene synthases play a role in the defence against fungal diseases in some plant species (e.g. groundnut or grapevine) by producing stilbene-type phytoalexins like resveratrol. Resveratrol is also claimed to have positive effects to human health. Embryogenic scutellar calli derived from immature embryos of the two commercial German spring wheat cultivars 'Combi' and 'Hanno' were used as target tissue for co-transformation by microprojectile delivery. The selectable marker/reporter gene constructs contained the bar-gene either driven by the ubiquitin-promoter from maize (pAHC 25, also containing the uidA-gene driven by the ubiquitin-promoter), or by the actin-promoter (pDM 302) from rice. The co-transferred plasmid pStil 2 consisted of a grapevine sts-coding region driven by the ubiquitin promoter. Eight transgenic 'Combi' and one 'Hanno' T-0-plant were obtained and, except one 'Combi' T-0-plant, found to be co-transformants due to the integration of both the sts-gene and the selectable marker or reporter genes. Expression of the sts-gene was proven by RT-PCR, and, for the first time, by detection of the stilbene synthase product resveratrol by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The sts-gene was expressed in four of the seven transgenic 'Combi' T-0-plants. Two of the respective T-1-progenies segregated in a Mendelian manner were still expressing the gene. Investigations into methylation of the sts-gene showed that in three non-expressing progenies inactivation was paralleled by methylation.

AB Screening of transgenic tissue on the basis of the anthocyanin pigmentation has been studied in wheat. Cell-autonomous anthocyanin pigmentation, controlled by B and C1 anthocyanin regulatory genes under the control of constitutive CaMV35s promoter (pBC1-7), was obtained in scutellum of immature embryos by biolistic procedures with or without a herbicide resistance gene (pAct1bar). Anthocyanin production as red/purple pigmented cells could be visualized 24 h after bombardment. Bialaphos herbicide resistant calli/plants generated transgenic sectors which showed light-dependent anthocyanin pigmentation. The pigmentation was suppressed in regenerating shoots but expressed in the ovary and pericarp of developing seeds. Transgenic shoots were obtained following selection of cultures co-bombarded with a selectable herbicide resistance gene. Southern analysis showed that transgenes were present as multiple copy insertions in high molecular weight DNA, The results obtained showed that anthocyanin marker could be used for tracking transformed tissue on the basis of anthocyanin pigment formation whose potential is realized by environmental factors particularly light.

AB Recent epidemics of fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe (telomorph: Gibberella zeae), in the USA and Canada have caused severe yield and quality losses in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Development of resistant cultivars has been difficult because of the complex inheritance of resistance and con founding environmental effects. This study was conducted to identify and map DNA markers linked to genes associated with FHB resistance. A population of 112 F-5-derived recombinant inbred (RI) wheat lines from the cross 'Sumai 3' (resistant)/'Stoa' (moderately susceptible) was evaluated in two greenhouse experiments for Type II resistance (spread within the spike). On the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marker analyses, five genomic regions were significantly (P < 0.01) associated with FHB resistance, three derived from Sumai 3 and two from Stoa. Regions on Chromosomes 3BS (from Sumai 3) and 2AL (from Stoa) were identified by interval analysis using a LOD threshold of 3.0. These two quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been assigned the gene designations QFhs.ndsu-3B and QFhs.ndsu-2A, respectively. Recombinant inbred lines with these two QTL had a median severity of 20.9%, compared with 36.2% for all RI lines. The best RFLP marker in the 3BS region explained 15.4% of the variation and a multiple regression model consisting of three QTL explained 29.5% of the variation. These results indicate that resistance to FHB is inherited in a quantitative manner and that marker-assisted selection may aid the development of FHB-resistant cultivars.

AB Several high molecular weight (HMW) proteins (40 to 96 kD) extracted from endosperm of rice seed were separated by 2D-PAGE, and visualized by CBB and silver staining. Molecular weight and pi standard markers were used to identify molecular weights and isoelectric focusing points of each protein, respectively. The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane, and the partial amino acid sequences of HMW proteins were determined by automatic Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequences of six of these proteins (having molecular weights of about 74, 71, 60, 57, 51, and 43 kD) were determined, while the N-terminal of six other proteins (having molecular weights of 96, 69, 67, 54, 45, and 42 kD) could nor be sequenced due to blockage of the N-terminus. Some internal amino acid sequences were also determined. Structural homology searches resulted in identification of 6 HMW proteins (enzymes), namely, starch debranching enzyme precursor, malate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, xylulose, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. In addition, three of the proteins appeared to be related to proteins in the heat shock family, i.e. chloroplast stroma protein (70 kD), HSP protein (70 kD), and chloroplast chaperonin (60 kD). Three proteins (60, 43 and 42 kD) were found to have no homology with those of known plant and animal proteins. All of these proteins were found to have a single polypeptide chain without intermolecular disulfide bonding.

AB We previously reported that treatment with aluminum (Al) leads to the accumulation of several polypeptides (12-, 23-, and 43.5-kDa) in root exudates of an Al-resistant cultivar of Triticum aestivum. In this report, we examine the segregation of the 23-kDa, Al-induced polypeptide and the Al-resistant phenotype in single F-2 plants arising from a cross between Al-resistant and Al-sensitive doubled-haploid (DH) lines. Single plants and plant populations were screened for sensitivity/resistance to Al using synthesis of 1,3-beta-glucans (callose) as a sensitive marker for Al injury. Callose production in the Al-sensitive cv. Katepwa was approximately 3-fold higher than observed in the Al-resistant cv. Maringa, or a near-isogenic line derived from Katepwa and Maringa (Alikat), over a broad range of Al concentrations (0-100 mu M), Similar results were observed with DH lines developed from cv, Katepwa, which produced two-four times more callose than DH lines developed from cv, Alikat, When single plants from F-1 and F-2 populations derived from a cross between DH Katepwa and DH Alikat were scored for Al-induced callose production after 4 days exposure to 100 mu M Al, all F-1 plants were Al-resistant and F-2 plants segregated approximately 3:1 for Al-resistance/sensitivity. A backcross population derived from crossing Al-resistant F, with Al-sensitive Katepwa, segregated 1:1 for Al-resistance/sensitivity. Thus, the Al-resistant phenotype is inherited in a monogenic, dominant fashion in our DH lines, Enhanced accumulation of the Al-induced, 23-kDa polypeptide in root exudates was a trait which co-segregated with the Al-resistant phenotype in F, populations. This polypeptide was strongly labeled with S-35-methionine after 3 days of Al exposure and 6 h labeling. When root exudate polypeptides were separated by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, the 23-kDa polypeptide demonstrated significant Al-binding capacity. This polypeptide has been purified to near-homogeneity, providing an opportunity to isolate the gene(s) encoding this polypeptide.

AB The 1AL.1RS wheat-rye chromosomal translocation originally found in 'Amigo' wheat possesses resistance genes for stem rust, powdery mildew and greenbug biotypes B and C, but also has a negative effect on wheat processing quality. Recently, a second 1AL.1RS translocation carrying Gb6, a gene conferring resistance to greenbug biotypes B, C, E, G and I, was identified in the wheat germplasm line 'GRS1201'. Protein analytical methods, and the DNA polymerase chain reaction were used to identify markers capable of differentiating the IRS chromosome arms derived from 'Amigo' and 'GRS1201'. The secalin proteins encoded by genes on 1RS chromosome arms differed in 'Amigo and 'GRS1201'. A 70 kDa secalin was found in the 'Amigo' 1AL.1RS, but did not occur in the 'GRS1201' 1AL.1RS. Polymorphisms detected by PCR primers derived from a family of moderately repetitive rye DNA sequences also differentiated the two translocations. When 'GRS1201' was mated with a non-1RS wheat, no recombinants between 1RS markers were observed. In crosses between 1RS and non-1RS parents, both DNA markers and secalins would be useful as selectable markers for 1RS-derived greenbug resistance. Recombination between 1RS markers did occur when 1RS from 'Amigo' and 1RS from 'GRS1201' were combined, but in such intermatings, the molecular markers described herein could still be used to develop a population enriched in lines carrying Gb6. No differences in grain yield or grain and flour quality characteristics were observed when lines carrying 1RS from 'Amigo' were compared with lines with 1RS from 'GRS1201'. Hence, differences in secalin composition did not result in differential quality effects. When compared with sister lines with 1AL.1AS derived from the wheat cultivar 'Redland', lines with 'GRS1201' had equal grain yield, but produced flours with significantly shorter mix times, weaker doughs, and lower sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation volumes.

AB Powdery mildew is one of the major diseases of wheat in regions with a maritime or semi-continental climate and can strongly affect grain yield. The attempt to control powdery mildew with major resistance genes (Pm genes) has not provided a durable resistance. Breeding for quantitative resistance to powdery mildew is more promising, but is difficult to select on a phenotypic basis. In this study, we mapped and characterised quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for adult-plant powdery mildew resistance in a segregating population of 226 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of the Swiss wheat variety Forno with the Swiss spelt variety Oberkulmer. Forno possibly contains the Pm5 gene and showed good adult-plant resistance in the field. Oberkulmer does not have any known Pm gene and showed a moderate susceptible reaction. Powdery mildew resistance was assessed in field trials at two locations in 1995 and at three locations in 1996. The high heritability (h(2) = 0.97) for powdery mildew resistance suggests that the environmental influence did not affect the resistance phenotype to a great extent. QTL analysis was based on a genetic map containing 182 loci with 23 linkage groups (2469 cM). With the method of composite interval mapping 18 QTLs for powdery mildew resistance were detected, explaining 77% of the phenotypic variance in a simultaneous fit. Two QTLs with major effects were consistent over all five environments. One of them corresponds to the Pm5 locus derived from Forno on chromosome 7B. The other QTL on 5A, was derived from the spelt variety Oberkulmer and did not correspond to any known Pm gene. In addition, five QTLs were consistent over three environments, and six QTLs over two environments. The QTL at the Pm5 locus showed a large effect, although virulent races for Pm5 were present in the mixture of isolates, Molecular markers linked with QTLs for adult-plant resistance offer the possibility of simultaneous marker-assisted selection for major and minor genes.

AB In order to identify sequence-tagged sites (STSs) appropriate for recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of barley cultivars 'Azumamugi' x 'Kanto Nakate Gold', a total of 43 STS primer pairs were generated on the basis of the terminal sequences of barley restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) clones. Forty one of the 43 primer pairs amplified PCR products in Azumamugi, Kanto Nakate Gold, or both. Of these, two showed a length polymorphism and two showed the presence or absence of polymorphism between the parents. PCR products of the remaining 37 primers were digested with 46 restriction endonucleases, and polymorphisms were detected for 15 primers. A 383.6-cM linkage map of RILs of Azumamugi x Kanto Nakate Cold was constructed from the 19 polymorphic STS primer pairs (20 loci) developed in this study, 45 previously developed STS primer pairs (47 loci), and two morphological loci. Linkage analysis and analysis of wheat-barley chromosome addition lines showed that with three exceptions, the chromosome locations of the STS markers were identical with those of the RFLP markers.

AB Chromosome 4A of wheat carries the Wx-B1 gene encoding the granule-bound starch synthase involved in amylose synthesis in the endosperm. To determine the pleiotropic effects of this locus and effects of independent QTLs on agronomic traits, genetical analysis of chromosome 4A was conducted using 98 single-chromosome recombinant substitution lines derived from a cross of Chinese Spring and Chinese Spring (Kanto107 4A) with a low amylose content due to the null Wx-Blb allele. For amylose content, most of the genetic variation was explained by the allelic difference at the Wx-B1 locus. An additional QTL of minor effect was mapped in the 6.2-cM Xbcd1738/Xcdo1387 interval on the short arm, where the allele from Kanto107 led to an increase in amylose content. Field trials over two seasons revealed a pleiotropic effect of Wx-B1, or else the effect of a closely linked QTL, on ear emergence time. A QTL linked to Wx-B1 was detected for plant height. For plant yield and its components, there was no evidence for significant main effects associated with Wx-B1 or adjacent regions. One plant-yield QTL was identified by RFLP markers on the short arm and this was identical to QTLs controlling spikelet number/ear and grain weight/ear. At these QTLs for agronomic traits, alleles from Kanto107 contributed to an earlier emergence time, a height reduction and an yield increase.

AB Nineteen sequence-tagged site (STS) primer pairs were designed on coding and non-coding regions in nine published Stylosanthes genes, which were mostly derived from cDNA. Direct sequencing of PCR products derived from genomic DNA allowed us to identify introns and to design specific primers flanking these introns. The use of 23 STS primer pairs for the detection of intra- and inter-specific variation in Stylosanthes based on size differences was tested on a core set of Stylosanthes species. Based on these results, 20 STS markers were selected to determine genetic relationships among 63 genotypes representing 24 Stylosanthes species. A total of 148 alleles were amplified and analyzed, resulting in a genetic similarity value ranging from 0.62 to 0.98 among the species. Based on duster analysis, three main groups and three subgroups were determined, and most of the species were classified unambiguously. Alloploid species were recognized by the occurrence of more than one allele per STS marker, indicating fixed heterozygosity. Sixteen STS markers were useful for the identification of genotypes within a species. Inter-species relationships, as revealed by STS, were in general agreement with previous morphological and molecular relationship studies. These STS markers are useful as an additional tool for the identification of species, subspecies and genotypes in Stylosanthes, with a view to plant conservation and breeding.

AB Progenies of an F-2 mapping population were analyzed for quantitative traits to detect QTLs by using marker information from F-2 plants for chromosome 5R. The mapping population was segregating for the major dwarfing gene Ddw1 and the gene Hp1 for hairy peduncle. The only QTL determining plant height was located between HP1 and Ddw1 on the distal part of chromosome 5RL. At the same position a QTL for peduncle length was found, and this trait was closely related to plant height (r = 0.895). Since Hp1 and Ddw1 are dominant marker loci, no dominance effect could be estimated. The QTLs for spike length and the number of florets were located near the centromere on 5RL. These two traits were correlated with r = 0.824 and showed partial dominance, but these traits were not correlated to plant height and peduncle length. Homoeologous relationships between the QTLs mapped for the first time in rye and those mapped in other Triticeae members are discussed.

AB Lodging can strongly affect both the grain yield and the quality of wheat. Lodging represents a quantitative trait and is difficult to assess on a phenotypic basis. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) could therefore become an important tool in breeding for lodging resistance. In this study, we mapped and characterised quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for lodging resistance, as well as morphological traits correlated with lodging, in a segregating population of 226 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of the lodging-resistant wheat variety Forno with the susceptible spelt variety Oberkulmer, Lodging, plant height, leaf width, leaf-growth habit, culm stiffness, culm swinging, culm thickness, days to ear emergence and days to flowering were assessed in field trials at two locations in 1996 and at one location in 1997, Additionally, at one location weight and length parameters were also assessed. Plant height and culm stiffness explained 77% of the phenotypic variance of lodging in a multiple regression model over all three environments. QTL analysis of lodging and morphological parameters was based on a genetic map containing 230 loci with 23 linkage groups (2469 cM). With the method of composite interval mapping nine QTLs for lodging resistance were detected, explaining 63% of the phenotypic variance in a simultaneous fit. Seven of these QTLs coincided with QTLs for morphological traits, reflecting the correlations between these traits and lodging. In our population the mast efficient way to improve lodging resistance would be by a combination of indirect selection on plant height and culm stiffness together with MAS on the two QTLs for lodging resistance which did not coincide with QTLs for morphological traits.

AB Although extensive synteny between hexaploid wheat and rice chromosomes has been demonstrated, synteny between the species breaks down in several regions of the wheat genome carrying agronomically important genes. A possible relationship between the wheat Vrn-Al, the vernalization response gene on chromosome 5A, and the rice Hd-6, a QTL controlling heading date by photoperiod response on chromosome 3, was investigated. Rice cDNA clones which had previously been mapped onto the Hd-6 region were screened for comparative genetic mapping of the Vrn-Al region. Ten markers mapped to Hd-6 were assigned to wheat chromosome 5A by nullisomic-tetrasomic analysis. Of them, four cDNA markers, linked within 2.2 cM in the rice Hd-6 region, were mapped on the flanking region of the wheat Vrn-Al, with a complete correspondence of order, demonstrating a fine-scale genetic collinearity. These results gave evidence that the wheat Vrn-Al region is in synteny with the rice Hd-6 region.

AB A total of 7654 DNA fragments were screened for linkage to wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pmlc employing fluorescently based AFLP analysis and phenotypic pools from F-3 families. F-3 and derived F-4 families were used for segregation analysis. Pool screening revealed several cosegregating and tightly linked (0.9 cM) AFLP markers for the Pmlc resistance gene. The previously reported RFLP locus Xwhs178 was integrated into the AFLP map in the vicinity of Pmlc. One AFLP marker, 18M2, was determined to be highly specific for the Pmlc gene in diverse genetic backgrounds. As Pmlc allele confers an effective resistance to powdery mildew, the marker 18M2 provides a valuable tool for enhancing marker assisted selection and pyramiding of powdery mildew resistance genes in wheat.

AB Scab is a destructive disease of wheat. To accelerate development of scab-resistant wheat cultivars, molecular markers linked to scab resistance genes have been identified by using recombinant inbred lines (Ws) derived by single-seed descent from a cross between the resistant wheat cultivar Ning 7840 (resistant to spread of scab within the spike) and the susceptible cultivar Clark. In the greenhouse, F-5, F-6, F-7, and F-10 families were evaluated for resistance to spread of scab within a spike by injecting about 1,000 conidiospores of Fusarium graminearum into a central spikelet. Inoculated plants were kept in moist chambers for 3 days to promote initial infection and then transferred to greenhouse benches. Scab symptoms were evaluated four times (3, 9, 15, and 21 days after inoculation). The frequency distribution of scab severity indicated that resistance to spread of scab within a spike was controlled by a few major genes. DNA was isolated from both parents and F-9 plants of the 133 RILs. A total of 300 combinations of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primers were screened for polymorphisms using bulked segregant analysis. Twenty pairs of primers revealed at least one polymorphic band between the two contrasting bulks. The segregation of each of these bands was evaluated in the 133 RILs. Eleven AFLP markers showed significant association with Scab resistance, and an individual marker explained up to 53% of the total variation (R-2). The markers with high R-2 values mapped to a single linkage group. By interval analysis, one major quantitative trait locus for scab resistance explaining up to 60% of the genetic variation for scab resistance was identified. Some of the AFLP markers may be useful in marker-assisted breeding to improve resistance to scab in wheat.

AB A soybean bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, comprising approximately 45 000 clones, was constructed from high-molecular-weight nuclear DNA of cultivar Williams 82, which carries the Rps1-k gene for resistance against Phytophthora sojae. The library is stored in 130 pools with about 350 clones per pool. Completeness of the library was evaluated for 21 random sequences including four markers linked to the Rps1 locus and 16 cDNAs. We identified pools containing BACs for all sequences except for one cDNA. Additionally, when screened for possible contaminating BAC clones carrying chloroplast genes, no sequences homologous to two barley chloroplast genes were found. The estimated average insert size of the BAC clones was about 105 kb. The library comprises about four genome equivalents of soybean DNA. Therefore? this,gives a probability of 0.98 of finding a specific sequence from this library. This library should be a useful resource for the positional cloning of Rps1-k, and other soybean genes. We have also evaluated the feasibility of an RFLP-based screening procedure for the isolation of BAC clones specific for markers that are members of repetitive sequence families, and are linked to the Rps1-k gene. We show that BAC clones isolated for two genetically linked marker loci, Tgmr and TC1-2, are physically linked. Application of this method in expediting the map-based cloning of a gene, especially from an organism, such as soybean, maize and wheat. with a complex genome is discussed.

AB We report the genetic mapping of Dwf2, a dominant gibberellic acid (GA(3))-insensitive dwarfing gene which has been previously described to cause a very short growth habit in barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant '93/B694'. Using RFLP and microsatellite markers we performed segregation analysis in an F-2 population comprising 86 individuals developed from a cross of '93/B694' (Dwf2) with 'Bonus M2' (dwf2). Dwf2 was mapped on the short arm of barley chromosome 4H proximal to microsatellite marker XhvOle (5.7cM) and distal to RFLP marker Xmwg2299 (18.3 cM). The genetic localization of the Dwf2 gene at a homoeologous position to the multiallelic Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 loci in wheat suggests synteny of GA-insensitive dwarfing genes within the Triticene. Moreover, the extremely prostrate growth habit exhibited in barley '93/B694' (Dwf2) resembles that of wheat plants carrying the genes Rht-B1c (Rht3) or Rht-D1c (Rht10).

AB The genus Trifolium (Leguminosae), which includes several important forage legumes of temperate and subtropical regions, is characterized by small chromosomes of uniform size. Cytogenetic mapping of the two multigene families coding for 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA and SS rRNA in white clover (T. repens) and seven closely related species/subspecies was carried out using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The 18S-26S rDNA, generally confined to nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), was consistently located proximally on the shorter arm of one or two metacentric or submetacentric chromosome pairs. DAPI-negative, diffused and highly stretched 18S-26S FISH signals, representing previously transcriptionally active NORs, were observed up to late metaphase. The Banking condensed ends of the diffused 18S-26S rDNA signals were DAPI-positive and represented perinucleolar knobs which are presumed to be transcriptionally inactive. In interphase cells, the decondensed NOR chromatin passed through the nucleolar domain. In one species(T. isthmocarpum), in addition to two NOR chromosome pairs, 18S-26S signals were also located on a third pair, with no apparent NOR association. The 5S rDNA signals were located proximally on a long arm in six species and were syntenic to the NORs in all these species except T. ambiguum and T. nigrescens sap. petrisavii. In two species (T, hybridum, T. isthmocarpum), SS sequences occurred in the chromosomal satellites aligned distally to the NOR sequences. The relative distribution patterns of the two types of tandemly repeated DNA sequences were species-specific except for T. nigrescens ssp. petrisavii and T. ambiguum, both of which showed identical hybridization patterns. The two types of rDNA sequences have provided molecular markers for individual identification of a set of clover chromosomes. Present findings support the allotetraploid origin of white clover (T. repens) and suggest that T. nigrescens ssp. petrisavii may be one of the present day diploid ancestors.

AB Increased grain protein is desirable for many bread and pasta products, Because of its importance to end-use quality and human nutrition, this trait has been widely studied. This study was conducted to (i) identify genomic regions associated with high grain protein concentration (GPC) inherited from Triticum turgidum L, var. dicoccoides in three hard red spring wheat recombinant inbred (RI) populations (ND683/'Bergen', 'Glupro'/'Keene', and Glupro/Bergen); (ii) examine the effects of genetic background and environment on these genes; and (iii) determine the genetic size of the Triticum turgidum L., ar. dicoccoides chromosomal segment introgressed into hard red spring wheat genotypes, The F-5-derived RI lines were grown at fire environments for the ND683/Bergen population and at three environments for the other two populations. The range of GPC in the ND683/Bergen, Glupro/Keene, and Glupro/Bergen population was 142 to 179, 149 to 182, and 139 to 183 g kg(-1), respectively. The four parental genotypes were surveyed for polymorphisms with 96 low copy DNA clones located on group 5 and 6 chromosomes. A single region associated with high GPC was detected with five RFLP markers (Xcdo365, Xmwg79, Xbcd102, Xbcd357, and Xcdo1380) located near the centromere on chromosome 6B, One of the markers (Xcdo365) identified a 6.5-kb restriction fragment in Triticum turgidum var, L, dicoccoides, Glupro, ND645, and ND683, Hence, this fragment is in coupling linkage to high GPC gene(s). This marker explained 21 to 35% of the phenotypic variation in GPC in the three populations. The DNA marker in this region might be used to rapidly introgress this gene for high GPC into other wheat germplasm.

AB Studying the heterogeneity in variation of gene frequency among populations or between generations may be a possible way to detect genomic regions experiencing selection. In order to evaluate this approach, RFLP markers were used to compare the allelic frequencies in wheat populations that had been submitted to natural selection. In 1984, samples of two composite cross populations were distributed in the French network for dynamic management of genetic resources. Since then, all the sub-populations have been cultivated in the same sites with no human selection. The strong differentiation between populations found for agro-morphological traits (earliness, resistance to pathogens,...) provided evidence of their adaptation to local conditions. The two initial populations and six derived sub-populations cultivated for 10 years in four contrasted sites were studied with RFLP markers. Differentiation between sub-populations based on RFLP diversity was highly significant. Variations of allelic frequencies of the 30 loci scored were found to be much greater than expected under genetic drift only. This led us to conclude that selection greatly influenced the evolution of the populations. Some of the loci clearly presented a higher differentiation than the others. This might indicate that they were genetically linked to other loci polymorphic in the populations and involved in adaptation. However, the effect of one selected gene on a marker, even located very close to the gene, could not be predicted with certainty. Hence, though the populations were predominantly selfing, it seems that initial linkage disequilibriums between markers and selected genes were not strong enough to control closely the evolution of allelic fequencies at the markers.

AB Origin and rearrangement of ribosomal DNA repeats in natural allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum are described. Comparative sequence analysis of the intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of Nicotiana tomentosiformis (the paternal diploid progenitor) and Nicotiana sylvestris (the maternal diploid progenitor) showed species-specific molecular features. These markers allowed us to trace the molecular evolution of parental rDNA in the allopolyploid genome of N. tabacum; at least the majority of tobacco rDNA repeats originated from N. tomentosiformis, which endured reconstruction of subrepeated regions in the IGS. We infer that after hybridization of the parental diploid species, rDNA with a longer IGS, donated by N. tomentosiformis, dominated over the rDNA with a shorter IGS from N. sylvestris; the latter was then eliminated from the allopolyploid genome. Thus, repeated sequences in allopolyploid genomes are targets for molecular rearrangement, demonstrating the dynamic nature of allopolyploid genomes.

AB Genetic diversity in random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) was studied in 110 genotypes of the tetraploid wild progenitor of wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, from 11 populations sampled in Israel and Turkey. Our results show high level of diversity of RAPD markers in wild wheat populations in Israel. The ten primers used in this study amplified 59 scorable RAPD loci of which 48 (81.4%) were polymorphic and 11 monomorphic. RAPD analysis was found to be highly effective in distinguishing genotypes of T, dicocioides originating from diverse ecogeographical sites: in Israel and Turkey, with 95.5% of the 100 genotypes correctly classified into sites of origin by discriminant analysis based on RAPD genotyping. However, interpopulation genetic distances showed no association with geographic distance between the population sites of origin, negating a simple isolation by distance model. Spatial autocorrelation of RAPD frequencies suggests that migration is not influential. Our present RAPD results are non-random and in agreement with the previously obtained allozyme patterns, although the genetic diversity values obtained with RAPDs are much higher than the allozyme values. Significant correlates of RAPD markers with various climatic and soil factors suggest that, as in the case of allozymes, natural selection causes adaptive RAPD ecogeographical differentiation. The results obtained suggest that RAPD markers are useful for the estimation of genetic diversity in wild material of T. dicoccoides and the identification of suitable parents for the development of mapping populations for the tagging of agronomically important traits derived from T. dicoccoides.

AB RFLP, RAPD, STS and DDRT-PCR techniques were applied to find molecular markers linked to Pm13, an Aegilops longissima gene conferring resistance to powdery mildew in wheat. The experimental strategy was based on the differential comparison of DNAs from common wheat and from common wheat/Ae. longissima recombinant lines carrying short segments of the 3S(l)S chromosome arm containing the Pm13 gene. Sixteen RFLP clones that detect loci previously located in the short arms of group-3 wheat chromosomes were screened for their ability to hybridise to Ae. longissima restriction fragments derived from the 3S(l)S segments introgressed into the recombinant lines. Eight RFLP clones and one STS marker detected 3S(l)S-specific fragments whose location relative to the wheat-alien chromatin breakage point of the recombinant lines was determined. Four amplification products were identified through the screening of about 200 RAPD primers. Their polymorphism was associated with the introgression of the alien DNA. One of the differential fragments was derived from the 3S(l)S DNA segment, while the remaining three corresponded to the replaced 3DS DNA. Further analyses carried out using 40 combinations of DDRT-PCR primers detected an additional reproducible polymorphism associated with the presence of 3S(l)S DNA. In view of their possible utilisation in Pm13 marker-assisted selection, differentially amplified RAPD and DDRT-PCR fragments were cloned, transformed into RFLP markers and converted into STS markers.

AB The characterization of the mitotic chromosomes of Helianthus argophyllus by means of Feulgen staining, Giemsa C-banding, and the usual DNA sequence-specific fluorochromes allows a chromosomal classification of this species, and shows that two kinds of heterochromatin co-exist equilocally in its chromosomes. One type is confined to the pericentromeric areas of all the chromosomes and the other is associated with the secondary constrictions of the satellite chromosomes. This species is evolutionarily very close to H. annuus with which it is involved in introgression breeding programs. Since these two species show no intra- or interspecific differences with the above treatments, we have used C-banding followed by DAPI, chromomycin A(3) or Acridine Orange, and the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with 5S and 18S-25S ribosomal DNA probes to characterize further the chromosomes of both species in an attempt to find practically applicable chromosomal markers. Our results confirm the heterogeneity of the heterochromatin in these species and show that neither its distribution nor its response to distinct fluorochrome treatments allows better discrimination of the chromosomes within or between the species. On the other hand, the 18S-5.8S-25S rDNA arrays are located in the secondary constrictions of the satellited SM7, SM10, and ST13 pairs and the 5S-rDNA genes are interstitially placed on the short arm of the SM7 and SM11 chromosomes in both species. This permits these chromosomes to be distinguished and provides markers which may be helpful for further physical mapping of DNA sequences in these species.

AB An investigation was made into the relationships between six species or subspecies of the genus Hordeum that grow in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands. Plant material included samples of 19 populations of the annual species H. marinum subsp. marinum, H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum, H. murinum subsp. murinum, and H. murinum subsp. leporinum, and the perennial species H. bulbosum and H. secalinum. Relationships were analysed using PCR-based molecular markers. Thirteen sets of primers were designed and synthesized based on sequences of mapped RFLPs from genomic libraries and conserved regions of structural genes of known function in cultivated species. Primers were used to amplify genomic DNA from all populations. The number of amplified products ranged from 1 to 18 per primer and a total of 168 markers were scored. The markers revealed different degrees of relationships. Hordeum bulbosum was clearly separated from the rest. The populations of both subspecies of H. murinum were closely related. H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum appeared to be closely related to H. secalinum, yet relatively separated from its conspecific subspecies marinum. The use of a large number of DNA markers in this kind of analysis is discussed.

AB Two isolates of the barley net blotch pathogen (Pyrenophora teres f. teres), one possessing high virulence (0-1) and the other possessing low virulence (15A) on the barley cultivar Harbin, were crossed and the progeny of the mating were isolated. Conidia from cultures of the parent and progeny isolates were used as inoculum to determine the inheritance of virulence in the pathogen. Of the 82 progeny tested, 42 exhibited high virulence and 40 exhibited low virulence on 'Harbin' barley. The data support a model in which a single, major gene controls virulence in P. teres f. teres on this barley cultivar (1:1 ratio; chi(2) = 0.05, P = 0.83). Preparations of DNA were made from parental and progeny isolates, and the DNA was subjected to the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique in a search for molecular genetic markers associated with the virulence phenotype. Five RAPD markers were obtained that were associated in coupling with low virulence. The data indicate that the RAPD technique can be used to tag genetic determinants for virulence in P. teres f. teres.

AB We developed a method for inducing sexual outcrosses in the homothallic Ascomycete fungus Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusarium graminearum). Strains were marked with different nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutations, and vegetative compatibility groups served as additional markers in some crosses. Strains with complementary nit mutations were cocultured on carrot agar plates. Ascospores from individual perithecia were plated on a minimal medium (MM) containing nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Crosses between different nit mutants segregated in expected ratios (3:1 nit(-):nit(+)) from heterozygous perithecia. Analysis of vegetative compatibility groups of progeny of two crosses indicated two and three vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes segregating, respectively. For rapid testing of sexual recombination between nit mutants, perithecia were inverted over MM to deposit actively discharged ascospores. Development of prototrophic wild-type colonies was taken as evidence of sexual recombination. Strains of G. zeae group 2 from Japan, Nepal, and South Africa, and from Indiana, Kansas, and Ohio in the United States were sexually interfertile. Four group 1 strains were not interfertile among themselves or with seven group 2 strains. Attempts to cross G. zeae with representatives of F. acuninatun, F: avenaceum, F: culmorum, F: crookwellense, F: oxysporum, and three mating populations of G. fujikuroi were not successful.

AB Simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based genetic markers are being actively developed for the majority of crop plant species. In barley, characterization of 290 dinucleotide repeat-containing clones from SSR-enriched libraries has revealed that a high percentage are associated with cereal retrotransposon-like and other dispersed repetitive elements. Associations found were with BARE-1, WIS2-1A, PREM1 and the dispersed repetitive element R173. Additional similarities between different SSR clones, which have no matches in DNA sequence databases, indicate that this phenomenon is probably widespread in the barley genome. Sequence homologies to the non-coding regions of several cereal genes were also explained by homology to mobile genetic elements. The SSRs found can therefore be classified into two types: (1) those with unique sequences on either flank, and (2) those which are intimately associated with retro-transposons and other dispersed repetitive elements. As the cereal genome is thought to consist largely of this type of DNA, some random association would be expected. However, the conserved positions of the SSRs, relative to repetitive elements, indicate that they have arisen non-randomly. Furthermore, this class of SSRs can be classified into three subtypes: (1) those which are positioned 3' of a transposable element with unique sequence on the other flank, (2) those positioned 5' of a transposable element, and (3) those which have arisen from an internal sequence and so have transposable element sequence on both flanks. The first appear to be analogous to the class of SSRs in mammalian systems which are associated with Alu elements and SINEs (short interspersed elements) and which have been postulated to arise following integration of an extended and polyadenylated retro-transcript into the host genome, followed by mutation of the poly(A) tract and expansion into an SSR. For the second, we postulate that a proto-SSR (A-rich sequence) has acted as a 'landing pad' for transposable element insertion (rather than being the result of insertion), while the third includes those which have evolved as a component of an active transposable element which has spread throughout the genome during bursts of transposition activity. The implications of these associations for genome and SSR evolution in barley are discussed.

AB Chromosome locations for gene orthologues of the dormancy-related maize transcription factor VIVIPAROUS-1, encoded by the Vp1 locus on maize chromosome 3, were determined in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) via linkage to markers on existing molecular maps using a cDNA of a wheat Vp1 orthologue as a probe in genomic Southern analyses. Vp1-orthologous loci were detected on the long arms of wheat chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D [Xlars10 (taVp1) loci] and rice chromosome 1 (osVp1). in line with previous evidence of synteny between these regions of the rice and wheat genomes and chromosome 3 of maize. The wheat loci mapped some 30 cM from the centromeres and some 30 cM proximal to the red grain (R) loci that control seed colour and coat-imposed dormancy. This unequivocal, genetic separation of the Vp1 and R loci may offer an opportunity for improving resistance to pre-harvest sprouting in wheat by combining the coat-imposed dormancy associated with red seed colour and true embryo dormancy regulated by Vp1.

AB The meiotic behaviour and relative transmission of segregant chromosomes was studied in the progeny of the Fl hybrids formed between a normal common wheat and lines which contained single or double wheat-rye translocations 1AL-1RS, 1BL-1RS and/or the substitution 1R(1D). Chromosome stability was evaluated in the F-2 progenies by the analysis of different markers: C-bands, LMW- and HMW-glutenins, gliadins and secalins coded for by genes GluA1, GluB1, GluD1, GluR1, GluA3, GluB3, GliA1, GliB1 and GliR1, located on either the short or long arm of the chromosomes of homoeologous group 1. Direct analysis of chromosome constitution and the chi(2) test, used in the genetic analysis of genes located in each chromosome arm, indicated that observed frequencies were significantly different from the expected Mendelian values in hybrids with only one translocation. The segregation patterns were biased in favour of the transmission of normal 1A over 1AL-1RS, normal 1B over 1BL-1RS, arm 1DL over 1RL and arm 1RS over 1DS. However, the same genes segregated in a Mendelian fashion in other hybrids with normal constitutions for these chromosomes or which showed double structural heterozygous constitution. The different response to the selection of different chromosomes or chromosome arms may be the product of an integrated contribution of meiotic behaviour plus differences in the vigour of male gametes carrying a normal chromosome compared to those carrying rye chromatin. However, it might also be due to differences in viability once male and female gametes combine. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).

AB Polymorphic DNA in complex genomes of agronomic crops can be detected using specific nucleotide and arbitrary primers and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nineteen accessions representing 10 species of the wild perennial soybean were evaluated using 4 sets of specific primers and 3 sets of random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPD) primers. The potential of the RAPD assays was further increased by combining two primers in a single PCR, The fragments generated by the two assays discriminated 10 wild species by banding profiles. The size of the amplified DNA fragments ranged from 100 to 2100 base pairs. The resolved PCR products yielded highly characteristic and homogeneous DNA fingerprints. The fingerprints were useful not only for investigating genetic variability but also for further characterizing the wild soybean species by detecting inter- and intra-specific polymorphisms, constructing dendrograms defining the phylogenetic relationships among these species, and identifying molecular markers for the construction of genetic linkage maps. Furthermore, unique markers distinguishing particular species were also identified. Thus, it is expected that PCR will have great relevance for taxonomic studies.

AB Experiments were undertaken to study the use of anthocyanin biosynthesis stimulatory genes under the control of CaMV35S promoter and first intron of maize alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1), as marker genes for genetic transformation of wheat haploid embryos and microspores by microprojectile bombardment. Transient expression was monitored for isolated microspore cultures of 1 and 8 days, after bombardment at 650 and 1100 psi. Anthocyanin expression in 1 day cultured microspores was only recovered at 650 psi, while a higher expression efficiency was obtained with 8 days old microspore culture at 1100 psi. Experiments conducted on embryos show that total regeneration as well as albino and green plant regeneration of embryos were not affected by bombardment. 64.5% embryos presented spots and 6.2% of the regenerated plants were chimeric, with sectorial expression of anthocyanin on leaves. The comparison of GUS and anthocyanin expression was realized and we have shown that anthocyanins are more reliable markers when compared with GUS. Besides being more practical, they give a better estimation of transformation procedure efficiency. Results show that anthocyanin biosynthesis stimulatory genes should be used as markers in haploid embryos and isolated microspores transformation in wheat.

TI Quantitative trait loci for flour viscosity in winter wheat
SO CROP SCIENCE

ID COMMON WHEAT; STARCH; NOODLE; QUALITY; PROTEIN
AB Starch paste viscosity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour is predictive of wheat quality in some styles of oriental noodles. We mapped quantitative genetic variation for flour paste viscosity in the recombinant inbred (RI) population of 78 lines derived from the cross NY6432-18/'Clark's Cream'. The population was evaluated for three seasons in Aberdeen, ID, and one season at Moscow. ID, and Ithaca, NY. We identified nine restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers (Xbcd1086, Xbcd1307, Xbcd135c, Xbcd18, Xbcd402, Xbcd198, Xcdo456, Xcdo678, and Xcdo718) that Here associated with significant differences (P < 0.01) in starch viscosity among the RI lines at two or more locations. The RFLP markers Xbcd1307, Xbcd135c, and Xbcd18c had the largest effects across all five environments; they were each associated with an approximate 7% increase in flour viscosity averaged across all RI lines and environments. Starch viscosity can be increased by mutations to the granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) gene of wheat. However, this mapping population is not segregating for GBSS mutations. Therefore, the quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified in this research could likely be combined with the qualitative mutations that are known in other genotypes.

Thell) cultivars Courtot, resistant to several isolates of powdery mildew ( Blumeria graminis DC. f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal), and Chinese Spring (susceptible) was used to map Mlar, a gene carried by Courtot and conferring resistance to this pathogen. The assignation of Mlar using monosomic lines of Courtot was confirmed by the mapping analysis. Mlar was located on the short arm of the chromosome 1A, in the vicinity of the locus XGli-A5 coding for storage proteins. This result was in accordance with those demonstrating that Mlar was an allele of the Pm3 locus (Pm3g), a gene also involved in the resistance to powdery mildew.

AB The Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm and a 1BL-1RS translocation chromosome that consists of the long arm of wheat chromosome 1B and the short arm of rye chromosome 1R were transferred to six spring common wheat cultivars by repeated backcrossing. Resistance to leaf rust race 21B conditioned by the Lr26 gene and a secalin subunit encoded by the Sec-1 gene, both on the 1RS arm, were used as the selection markers of the translocation chromosome. Five of the six cultivars used were converted to complete male steriles, whereas the remaining one, cv. Kitamiharu 48, retained normal fertility, after transfer of both the 1BL-1RS chromosome and Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm. Conventional gene analysis suggested that Kitamiharu 48 carries an incompletely dominant fertility-restoring gene. The F-1 hybrids between the male steriles and ordinary common wheat cultivars recovered fertility only at a low level, indicating that a single dose of the Rfv1 gene on the 1BS arm of wheat is insufficient for full fertility restoration under spring-sowing condition. Our results are in clear contrast to complete fertility restoration under fall-sowing condition reported by Nonaka et al. (1993). Combination of the 1BL-1RS chromosome / Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm system with a new fertility-restoring gene discovered in Kitamiharu 48 may provide a breakthrough for spring-type hybrid wheat.

AB Seven plant genomic DNA purification protocols were evaluated for genetic fingerprinting analysis using six tissues obtained from inbred carrot (Daucus carota L.) lines. Evaluations included 1) DNA yield, 2) DNA purity, 3) DNA cleavage with HindIII, 4) DNA integrity, and 5) DNA suitability for amplification in a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) system. Significant differences were observed among tissues and purification methods for the total amount of DNA, An extraction method using CTAB buffer + organic solvents gave the best results in DNA yield, purity, and HindIII cleavage when compared with the other six nonorganic extraction methods. Of the tissues examined, flowers yielded the most DNA (average value = 115 ng of DNA/mg of fresh tissue); followed by seeds (54 ng . mg(-1)), fresh leaves (48 ng . mg(-1)), lyophilized leaves (40 ng . mg(-1)), calli (22 ng . mg(-1)), and tap roots (4 ng . mg(-1)). For most of the preparations, the DNA showed no traces of degradation. However, DNA preparations were not consistently accessible to HindIII cleavage in all tissue-extraction method combinations, Uncut DNA was observed chiefly in extractions from flowers and fresh leaves suggesting a tissue-specific adverse effect on restriction endonuclease activity. Differences in RAPD band (amplicon) intensity and number were observed across tissues and DNA extraction methods using identical PCR conditions for RAPD, Callus was the best type of tissue for RAPD-based fingerprinting yielding a consistently higher number of more intense amplicons when compared to the other tissues. In flowers and seeds, only DNA obtained with the CTAB extraction method could be amplified, Polymorphisms deviating from genetic expectations were mainly observed in root and fresh leaf DNA, indicating that some RAPD markers may not present satisfactory levels of reproducibility. Judicious and uniform selection of DNA purification method as well as tissue source for DNA extraction are, therefore, important considerations for reliable RAPD-based DNA fingerprinting analysis in carrot. In addition, our studies allowed the identification of a better combination of procedures for use in routine manipulations of carrot DNA such as RFLP-RAPD-based cultivar fingerprinting, molecular mapping, screening of transgenic plants, construction of genomic libraries, and gene cloning.

AB The Yr17 gene, which is present in many European wheat cultivars, displays yellow rust resistance at the seedling stage. The gene introduced into chromosome 2A from Aegilops ventricosa was previously found to be closely linked (0.5 cM) to leaf and stem rust resistance genes Lr37 and Sr38, respectively. The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to the Yr17 gene. We screened with RAPD primers, for polymorphism, the DNAs of cv. Thatcher and the leaf rust-resistant near-isogenic line (NIL) RL 6081 of cv. Thatcher carrying the Lr37 gene. Using a F-2 progeny of the cross between VPM1 (resistant) and Thesee (susceptible), the RAPD marker OP-Y15(580) was found to be closely linked to the Yr17 gene. We converted the OP-Y15580 RAPD marker into a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR). This SCAR marker (SC-YIS) was linked at 0.8 +/- 0.7 cM to the Yr17 resistance gene. We tested the SC-YIS marker over a survey of 37 wheat cultivars in order to verify its consistency in different genetic backgrounds and to explain the resistance of some cultivars against yellow rust. Moreover, we showed that the Xpsr150-2M(v) locus marker of Lr gene described by Bonhomme et al. [6] which possesses A. ventricosa introgression on the 2A chromosome was also closely linked to the Yr17 gene. Both the SCAR SC-Y15 and Xpsr150-2M(v) markers should be used in breeding programmes in order to detect the cluster of the three genes Yr17, Lr37 and Sr38 in cross progenies.

AB A bioassay was developed for identifying transgenic wheat plants based on De Block et al.'s [8] ammonium-multiwell assay which allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the expression of the enzyme phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT). Important parameters in the assay are the use of young leaf tissues, short incubation period (6 h) and a high light intensity during incubation (250 mu mol s(-1) m(-2)). The assay is quick and results are obtained within a day. Ammonium measurements based on a colourimetric (modified Berthelot) reaction are conducted using sodium salicylate to avoid the use of phenol. Results of the assay show high correlation with Basta leaf painting tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. Thus, the assay may be used as a facile screen for bar-expressing transgenic cereals.

AB The physical locations of the 5S and 18S-25S rDNA sequences were examined in nine wild Hordeum species and cytotypes by double-target in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labelled 5S rDNA and biotin-labelled 18S-25S rDNA as probes. H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum (2n = 2x = 14; I-genome) had a similar composition of 5S and 18S-25S rDNA to cultivated barley (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare, I-genome), with two major 18S-25S rDNA sites and minor sites on four of the other five chromosomes; three chromosomes had 5S rDNA sites. The closely related H. bulbosum (2x; also I-genome) showed only one pair of 5S rDNA sites and one pair of 18S-25S rDNA sites on different chromosomes. Four wild diploid species, H. marinum (X-genome), H. glaucum and H. murinum (Y-genomes) and H. chilense (H-genome), differed in the number (2-3 pairs), location, and relative order of 5S and the one or two major 18S-25S rDNA sites, but no minor 18S-25S rDNA sites were observed. H. murinum 4x had three chromosome pairs carrying 5S rDNA, while the diploid had only a single pair. Two other tetraploid species, H. brachyantherum 4x and H. brevisubulatum 4x (both considered to have H-type genomes), had minor 18S-25S rDNA sites, as well as the major sites. Unusual double 5S rDNA sites - two sites on one chromosome arm separated by a short distance - were found in the American H-genome species, H. chilense and H. brachyantherum 4x. The results indicate that the species H. brachyantherum 4x and H. brevisubulatum 4x have a complex evolutionary history, probably involving the multiplication of minor rDNA sites (as in H. vulgare sensu late), or the incorporation of both I and H types of genome. The rDNA markers are useful for an investigation of chromosome evolution and phylogeny.

AB Germin-like proteins (GLPs) ionically bound to the walls of preglobular somatic embryos of Pinus caribaea Morelet are markers of this early developmental stage. In order to reveal the physiological implications of such markers during early embryo development, we isolated a cDNA clone from somatic embryos predicted to encode a protein with sequence similarity to GLPs. PcGER1 has an open reading frame corresponding to a 220 amino acid polypeptide with a putative N-glycosylation site on Asn-69. The presence of a 24 amino acid putative signal peptide supports the hypothesis of an apoplastic location. The N-terminal 20 amino acid sequence of the predicted mature protein is identical to the amino terminal sequence of GP111, one of the extracellular pine GLPs previously identified. Southern blot hybridizations indicate that PcGER1 is probably unique in the pine genome. Transcripts homologous to PcGER1 are abundant in all embryogenic lines, absent from nonembryogenic lines, and present in quiescent zygotic embryos but not in the female gametophyte, the haploid storage tissue of conifers. Their abundance sharply decreases during germination. Isolation of gf-0.8, a genomic fragment identical to PcGER1 cDNA sequence, confirms that no introns disrupt the coding region as it has been already described for wheat gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 genomic clones.

AB Consensus linkage maps were constructed for all seven rye chromosomes using 12 basic RFLP maps. The maps presented contain a total of 413 markers. The number of markers per chromosome varies from 41 (chromosome 3R) to 83 (chromosome 1R). In addition to 374 RFLP and 24 isozyme markers 15 gene loci were incorporated, determining the traits reduced plant height, self fertility, male sterility restoration, vernalization response, resistance against powdery mildew, chlorophyll deficiency, hairy leaf sheath, hairy peduncle, waxy endosperm, waxless plant and absence of ligules. The maps presented allow the selection of markers for the fine mapping of certain regions of the rye genome. In terms of the known chromosomal rearrangements within the Triticeae its utilization can also be extended for mapping in wheat and barley.

AB Our long-term goal is to control wheat diseases through the enhancement of host plant resistance. The constitutive expression of plant defense genes to control fungal diseases can be engineered by genetic transformation. Our experimental strategy was to biolistically transform wheat with a vector DNA containing a rice chitinase gene under the control of the CaMV 35 S promoter and the bar gene under control of the ubiquitin promoter as a selectable marker. Immature embryos of wheat cv 'Bobwhite' were bombarded with plasmid pAHG11 containing the rice chitinase gene chill and the hm gene. The embryos were subcultured on MS2 medium containing the herbicide bialaphos. Calli were then transferred to a regeneration medium, also containing bialaphos. Seventeen herbicide-resistant putative transformants (T-0) were selected after spraying with 0.2% Liberty, of which 16 showed bar gene expression as determined by the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) assay. Of the 17 plants, 12 showed the expected 35-kDa rice chitinase as revealed by Western blot analysis. The majority of transgenic plants were morphologically normal acid self-fertile. The integration, inheritance and expression of the chi11 and bar genes were confirmed by Southern hybridization, PAT and Western blot analysis of T-0 and T-1 transgenic plants. Mendelian segregation of herbicide resistance was observed in some T-1 progenies. Interestingly, a majority of the T-1 progeny had very little or no chitinase expression even though the chitinase transgene was intact. Because PET gene expression under control of the ubiquitin promoter was unaffected, we conclude that the CaMV 35 S promotor is selectively inactivated in T-1 transgenic wheat plants.

DT Article
ID WHEAT; REARRANGEMENTS
AB Resistance genes for leaf rust (Puccinia recondita Rob. ex Desm.) and greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) were transferred from chromosome 78 of Triticum speltoides (Tausch) Gren. to chromosome 7A of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by means of the ph1b mutation that promotes homeologous recombination. The chromosome segments from T. speltoides were characterized by C-banding and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). Since the segments of T. speltoides chromosome 78 do not recombine with wheat chromosome 7A in the presence of the wild-type Phl locus only one molecular marker per chromosome segment is required to monitor the introgressed genes in marker assisted selection programs. The new leaf rust resistance gene, designated Lr47, and the greenbug resistance gene Gb5 were located on interstitial chromosome segments from T. speltoides translocated to wheat chromosome arms 7AS and 7AL, respectively. Physically, both were located in the distal one third of the arms, but genetically the Lr47 segment was 2 to 10 centimorgans (cM) from the centromere and was 20 to 30 cM long; the Gb5 segment was 18 to 22 cM from the centromere and was 40 to 50 cM long.

AB In the present study, we investigated and compared the ability of the cholera toxin B subunit, wheat germ agglutinin and isolectin B4 from Griffonia simplicifolia I conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, to retrogradely and transganglionically label visceral primary afferents after unilateral injections into the rat urinary bladder wall. Horseradish peroxidase histochemical or lectin-immunofluorescence histochemical labelling of bladder afferents was seen in the L6-S1 spinal cord segments and in the T13-L2 and L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia. In the lumbosacral spinal cord, the most intense and extensive labelling of bladder afferents was seen when cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase was injected. Cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase-labelled fibres were found in Lissauer's tract, its lateral and medial collateral projections, and laminae I and IV-VI of the spinal gray matter. Labelled fibres were numerous in the lateral collateral projection and extended into the spinal parasympathetic nucleus. Labelling from both the lateral and medial projections extended into the dorsal grey commissural region. Wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase labelling produced a similar pattern but was not as dense and extensive as that of cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase. The isolectin B4 from Griffonia simplicifolia I-horseradish peroxidase-labelled fibres, on the other hand, were fewer and only observed in the lateral collateral projection and occasionally in lamina I. Cell profile counts showed that a larger number of dorsal root ganglion cells were labelled with cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase than with wheat germ agglutinin- or isolectin B4-horseradish peroxidase. In the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia, the majority (81%) of the cholera toxin B subunit-, and almost all of the wheat germ agglutinin- and isolectin B4-immunoreactive cells were RT97-negative (an anti-neurofilament antibody that labels dorsal root ganglion neurons with myelinated fibres). Double labelling with other neuronal markers showed that 71%, 43% and 36% of the cholera toxin B subunit-immunoreactive cells were calcitonin gene-related peptide-, isolectin B4-binding and substance P-positive, respectively. A few cholera toxin B subunit cells showed galanin-immunoreactivity, but none were somatostatin-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, or neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive or contained fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase.
   The results show that cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase is a more effective retrograde and transganglionic tracer for pelvic primary afferents from the urinary bladder than wheal germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase and isolectin B4-horseradish peroxidase, but in contrast to somatic nerves, it is transported mainly by unmyelinated fibres in the visceral afferents.

AB The small grain cereal pathogen Fusarium culmorum was successfully transformed with the Escherichia coli beta-D-glucuronidase gene (gusA) (GUS reporter gene) using the E. coli hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph) as a selectable marker. The frequency of transformation to hygromycin B tolerance was higher for plasmid pGUS5 than plasmid pTUBA-GUS. Southern hybridization analysis of transformants revealed that single or multiple copies of the gusA gene were integrated into the genomes of transformants. Following successive sub-culturing on nonselective media, the majority of transformants remained tolerant to hygromycin B. After mitotic stabilization by single conidial isolation, most transformants retained GUS expression, although individual transformants differed markedly in GUS activity levels. Transformants were not found to differ in pathogenicity towards wheat seedlings, as compared to the wild type progenitor isolate. Expression of gusA during fungal growth on plants was detected both macroscopically and microscopically. The Feasibility of using a F. culmorum GUS transformant as a screening tool For evaluating fungicide efficacy was examined, and results showed that the GUS reporter gene system allowed discrimination between the effectiveness of different fungicides against F. culmorum foot rot of wheat.

AB Three deletion lines (de16V # 2S-1, del6V # 2L-1, and del6V # 2L-2) of Haynaldia villosa chromosome 6V added to wheat were identified by C-banding and characterized by RFLP analyses. The breakpoints were located at fraction lengths (FL) 0.58 in del6V # 2S-1 in the short arm, and FL 0.66 in del6V # 2L-1 and FL 0.64 in del6V # 2L-2 in the long arm. Thirty-one Triticeae homoeologous group-6 DNA probes were used to map RFLP loci in the deletion lines and the wheat-ii, villosa disomic substitution (DS) line 6V # 2(6A). Nine probes failed to detect polymorphism between Chinese Spring and DS6V # 2(6A). Ten of sixteen polymorphic short-arm loci were not detected in del6V # 2S-1. Thus, the loci are located in the deleted distal chromosome region. Six RFLP markers were mapped in the proximal 58% of 6VS. Of 20 DNA markers specific for 6VL, six mapped in the distal 36% of the long arm, and nine mapped in the proximal 64% of 6VL, The breakpoint of the short arm of 6V # 2 occurs between Xpsr106 and Xcdo270, and that of the long arm between Xpsr915 and Xmwg934. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 is located on the short arm of chromosome 6V # 2. Pm21 is present in del6V # 2S-1, and can be further mapped in the proximal 58% of 6V # 2S.

AB An intervarietal molecular-marker map was used for the detection of genomic regions influencing crossability between wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) and rye (Secale cereale L.). Analysis of deviance and logistic marker-regression methods were conducted on data from doubled haploid lines from a cross between "Courtot" and "Chinese Spring". A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) involved in crossability, associated with the marker Xfba367-5B, was detected on the short arm of chromosome 5B. An additional locus, Xwg583-5B, was indicated on the long arm of chromosome 5B, This minor QTL might correspond to Kr1 which was presumed to be the major gene controlling crossability. Another locus of the genome, Xtam51-7A on chromosome 7A, was significantly associated with this trait. Alleles of "non-crossability" were contributed by the non-crossable cultivar "Courtot". The three-marker model explains 65% of the difference in crossability between the two parents. The present results are discussed in relation to those previously carried out to locate the Kr genes by using the telocentric mapping technique.

ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L; WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION
AB Rye has one of the most efficient group of genes for aluminium (Al) tolerance among cultivated species of Triticeae. This tolerance is controlled by at least two independent and dominant loci (Alt1 and Aln) located on chromosomes 6RS and 4R. We used two pooled DNA samples, one of Al-tolerant individuals and another of Al-sensitive plants from one F-2 that segregated for the Alt1 locus. We also used two pooled DNA samples, one with genotypes II and another with genotypes 22 for the Lap1 locus (leucin aminopeptidase) from another F-2 progeny that segregated for this locus, located on the 6RS chromosome arm. We identified several RAPD markers associated with the pooled Al-tolerant plants and also with one of the bulks for the Lap1 locus. The RAPD fragments linked to Alt1 and Lap1 genes were transformed into SCAR markers to confirm their chromosomal location and linkage data. Two SCARs (ScR01(600) and ScB15(7900)) were closely linked to the Alt1 locus, ScR01(600) located 2.1 cM from Alt1 and ScB15(790) located 5.5 cM from Alt1, on the 6RS chromosome arm. These SCAR markers can aid in the transfer of Al tolerance genes into Al-sensitive germplasms.

AB A population of R-0 transgenic wheat plants, generated by particle bombardment, was analyzed to define molecular, genetic and phenotypic properties resulting from transformation with a cointegrate vector, or cotransformation with two separate plasmids. By evaluating the progeny of 70 independently-derived transgenic plants, we also identified rare events such as chimerism and transgene elimination, which provide valuable information concerning the development of transgenic cereal plants following bombardment experiments. The frequency of chimerism in our transgenic wheat plants was very low Furthermore, while transgene elimination did occur, this was also a very ran event. We determined the copy numbers of integrated transgenes and the levels of transgene expression. Comparisons to transgenic rice plants generated in the same manner demonstrated some similarities, but also important differences in transgene behavior. Whereas in rice there is no evidence for any direct relationship between transgene copy number and transgene expression or stability, multicopy populations in wheat demonstrated a bias towards higher levels of expression for the two genes and the maize ubiquitin promoter evaluated in the present study.

AB The Lr3 gene for resistance to race 66 of Puccinia recondita present in hexaploid wheat cv. Sinvalocho MA was mapped on chromosome 6B, using intervarietal polymorphic RFLP loci and the Amp-BI isozyme gene as a centromere marker. The RFLP markers were located mainly in two subregions of chromosome 6BL. Six RFLP loci clustered in the centromeric region and one other, Xmwg798, cosegregated with the Lr3 gene. C-banding analysis of the leaf rust resistant standard 'Sinvalocho MA' line and three naturally occurring susceptible lines of 'Sinvalocho MA' revealed a terminal deletion on 6BL that covered 20% of its length in one susceptible line. Because Xmwg798 was missing in this line, both Xinwg798 and Lr3 were allocated to the deleted segment. Distorted segregations were observed for the proximal markers, suggesting a selection against gametes carrying the centromeric region of 'Sinvalocho MA'.

AB The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), an important insect pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., has a gene-for-gene relationship with wheat: single genes in the insect condition avirulence to specific resistance genes in wheat. We report the discovery of the first molecular genetic marker that is tightly linked to a Hessian fly avirulence gene. This dominant DNA polymorphism (OPG15-1) was identified using bulked segregant analysis and arbitrary primers in polymerase chain reactions. Bulked segregant analysis was modified to accommodate the anomalous chromosome cycle of the Hessian fly. It was used to identify DNA polymorphisms linked to the gene (vH6) that confers avirulence to the resistance gene H6 in wheat. OPG15-1 was cloned and sequenced, and a pair of site-specific primers were designed that converted it into a codominant single-stranded conformational polymorphism. Both OPG15-1 and vH6 were shown to be X-linked, and the genetic distance between the two loci was 2.5 +/- 2.5 cM. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes of larval salivary glands indicated that OPG15-1 resides near the centromere of Hessian fly chromosome X1.

AB A strain of Tribolium castaneum, highly resistant to pyrethroids, was isolated (single-pair method) from a pyrethroid-resistant field strain and made isogenic with a susceptible laboratory strain, Insecticide assays were used to determine the mode of inheritance and linkage of pyrethroid resistance. Resistance to deltamethrin could not be measured directly but at a 2% mortality response was about 1600-fold. The responses of SR and RS hybrids to deltamethrin were intermediate between the resistant and susceptible parent strains; there was no significant difference between the SR and RS hybrids (P > 0.05). Chi-square analysis of the observed responses of the FI-backcross and Fz progenies rejected the null hypothesis that a single gene was responsible for resistance. Successive backcrosses with selection indicated the involvement of more than one gene, Test crosses with visible mutant markers suggested that resistance was associated with Linkage groups VIII and IX. Assays with deltamethrin applied to grain indicated that this resistance will be rapidly selected in the held resulting in control failures. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The gene was linked to the two flanking markers Xmwg2264 and Xmwg916 by 6.7 and 13.0 cM, respectively. Compared to Ppd-H1 (chromosome 2H) and Ppd-H2 (chromosome 1H), ea(7) determines the strongest effect on flowering time with 55 and 18 days difference compared to photoperiod sensitive genotypes grown under short and long photoperiods, respectively. Allelic and homoeologous relationships to major genes and quantitative trait loci controlling flowering time in barley and wheat are discussed.

AB The adaptability of Triticum aestivum to a large range of environments is partially due to genetic differences in sensitivity to vernalization. The most potent gene reducing the vernalization requirement in hexaploid wheat is Vrn-A1. An orthologous vernalization gene, designated Vrn-A(m)1, was mapped in the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum between RFLP markers Xwg908 and Xabg702 on the long arm of chromosome 5A(m)L. The orthology of VrnA(m)1 with Vrn-A1 (5A wheat, originally Vrn1), Vrn-D1 (5D wheat, originally Vrn3), Vrn-R1 (5R rye, originally Sp1) and Vrn-H1 (5H barley, originally Sh2) was shown by mapping RFLP markers linked to these vernalization genes on the T. monococcum linkage map. A second vernalization gene, designated Vrn-A(m)2, was found in the distal region of chromosome 5A(m)L within a segment translocated from homoeologous group 4. This gene is completely linked to RFLP marker Xbcd1402 and located between the same RFLP markers (X beta-Amy-1 and Xmwg616) as the Vrn-H2 (originally Sh) locus in Hordeum vulgare.

AB A genetic map of the long arm of chromosome 6R of rye was constructed using eight homoeologous group-6 RFLP clones and five PCR markers derived from the rye-specific dispersed repetitive DNA family, R173. The map was developed using a novel test-cross F-1 (TC-F-1) population segregating for resistance to the cereal cyst nematode. Comparisons were made between the map generated with other rye and wheat group-6 chromosome maps by the inclusion of RFLP clones previously mapped in those species. Go-linearity was observed for common loci. This comparison confirmed a dramatic reduction in recombination for chromosome 6R in the TC-F-1 population. The CreR locus was included in the linkage map via progeny testing of informative TC-F-1 individuals. CreR mapped 3.7 cM distal from the RFLP locus, XksuF37. Comparative mapping should allow the identification of additional RFLP markers more closely linked to the CreR locus.

AB Generalized tonic-clonic seizures of brain stem origin in rats are associated with acute induction of neuronal Fos in several discrete regions of the brain. One particular site in the dorsal pans shows remarkable Fos induction following generalized tonic seizures induced by maximal electroshock in normal rats or by audiogenic stimulation in genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs). Although this area shows the most intense Fos induction of any brain area following generalized tonic seizures, its identity has been uncertain. Based an its general location, we hypothesized that this nucleus was either 1) a component of the pedunculopontine tegmentum nucleus-pars compacta (PPTn-pc) or 2) the superior lateral subnucleus of lateral parabrachial area (LPBsl). The present study used Fos-protein immunocytochemistry in combination with the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase histochemistry, cholecystokinin (CCK) immunocytochemistry, and neuronal tract-tracing to determine the identity of this cluster of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the dorsal pens. Following maximal electroshock seizure (MES), Fos labeling was compared to NADPH diaphorase staining (a marker for cholinergic neurons of the PPTn-pc); retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH; to identify the LPBsl) or CCK immunoreactivity (also a marker for LPBsl neurons). Results showed this cluster of Fos immunoreactive (FI) neurons to be closely associated, but not overlapping, with the lateral and most caudal aspect of the PPTn-pc. Alternatively, WGA-HRP retrograde-labeled neurons corresponded precisely with the seizure-induced FI neurons. Additionally, the location of CCK immunoreactive neurons directly overlapped with the FI neurons, although they were not nearly as prevalent. These results demonstrate that the seizure-induced FI neurons in this area are neurons of the LPBsl and not cholinergic neurons of the PPTn-pc. This is the first report of seizure-induced Fos expression specifically localized to the superior lateral subnucleus of the lateral parabrachial area. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

The map was developed using an F-2 population of 103 plants from a cross between two inbred lines. Both loci were mapped distally on the short arm of chromosome 2R and clearly tagged in relation to 12 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. The Sec2 locus was localized between the Xiag57 and Xpsr109a loci in an 11cM interval. The Sec5 locus co-segregated to Xiag57 and was lightly linked to the Sec2 locus at a map distance of 0.5 cM.

AB A sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker is reported linked to Lr28, a leaf rust resistance gene in wheat. RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analysis of near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Lr28 in eight varietal backgrounds was carried out using random primers. Genomic DNA enriched for low-copy sequences was used for RAPD analysis to overcome the lack of reproducibility due to the highly repetitive DNA sequences present in wheat. Of 80 random primers tested on the enriched DNA, one RAPD marker distinguished the NILs and the donor parent from the susceptible recurrent parents. The additional band present in resistant lines was cloned, sequenced, and STS primers specific for Lr28 were designed. The STS marker (Indian patent pending: 380 De198) was further confirmed by bulk segregation analysis of F-3 families. It was consistently present in the NILs, the resistant F-3 bulk and the resistant F-3 lines, but was absent in recurrent parents, the susceptible Fg bulk and the susceptible F-3 lines.

AB The objectives of this study were to evaluate the usefulness of a fluorescent-analysis method for genotyping PCR-based tomato microsatellite markers (Or STMSs) and to establish the value of these markers to generate unique DNA profiles of tomato cultivars. The analyses were performed using forward primers labelled with a fluorochrom and using an ALF express DNA sequencer. In general, analysis of the tomato STMSs revealed distinct allelic peaks. PCR artefacts like stuttering and differential amplification were observed for several tomato STMS markers, but in most cases these artefacts did not seriously hamper allele designation. Comparison of fluorescent and silver-stained allelic profiles revealed a similar distribution of alleles among the test cultivars. Sixteen tomato cultivars were DNA-typed for 20 selected STMS markers using the fluorescent approach. Length polymorphism among the PCR products was detected with 18 of these markers, yielding gene diversity values from 0.06 to 0.74. The number of alleles per microsatellite locus ranged from 2 to 8. As few as four STMSs were sufficient to differentiate between all 16 cultivars. indicating that these markers are especially suitable for a species like tomato which has low levels of variation as detected by other types of markers.

AB The physical sites of 18S-5.8S-25S and 5S rRNA genes and telomeric sequences in the Musa L. genome were localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization on mitotic chromosomes of selected lines. A single major intercalary site of the 18S-5.8S-25S rDNA was observed on the short arm of the nucleolar organizing chromosome in each genome. AA and BE genome diploids had a single pair of sites, triploids had three sites while a tetraploid hybrid had four sites. The probe is useful for quick determination of ploidy, even using interphase nuclei from slowly growing tissue culture material. Variation in the intensity of signals was observed among heterogeneous Musa lines indicating variation in the number of copies of the 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA genes. Eight subterminal sites of 58 rDNA were observed in Calcutta 4 (AA) while Butohan 2 (BB) had six sites; some were weaker in both genotypes. Triploid lines showed six to nine major sites of 5S rDNA of widely varying intensity and near the limit of detection. The diploid hybrids had five to nine sites of 5S rDNA while the tetraploid hybrid had 11 sites. The telomeric sequence was detected as pairs of dots at the ends of all the chromosomes analysed but no intercalary sequences were seen. The molecular cytogenetic studies of Musa using repetitive and single copy DNA probes should yield insight into the genome and its evolution and provide data for Musa breeders, as well as generating genetic markers in Musa.

AB The fungal wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola was transformed to carbendazim and hygromycin B resistance. A beta-tubulin gene from a M. graminicola strain resistant to the fungicide carbendazim was cloned and used to transform a sensitive strain to carbendazim resistance. Hygromycin B-resistant transformants (up to 8 per mu g Of transforming DNA) arose at a higher rate than beta-tubulin transformants (up to 0.6 per mu g of DNA). Transformants were able to infect wheat and were morphologically similar to recipient strains.

AB Genes cloned from diverse plants for resistance to different pathogens have sequence similarities in domains presumably involved in pathogen recognition and signal transduction in triggering the defense response. Primers based on the conserved regions of resistance genes often amplify multiple fragments that may not be separable in an agarose gel. We used denaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis to detect PCR products of plant genomic DNA amplified with primers based on conserved regions of resistance genes. Depending upon the primer pairs used, 30-130 bands were detected in wheat, rice, and barley. As high as 47%, 40%, and 27% of the polymorphic bands were detected in rice, barley, and wheat, respectively, and as high as 12.5% of the polymorphic bands were detected by certain primers in progeny from a cross of the wheat cultivars 'Stephens' and 'Michigan Amber'. Using F-6 recombinant inbred lines from the 'Stephens' x 'Michigan Amber' cross, we demonstrated that polymorphic bands amplified with primers based on leucine-rich repeats, nucleotide-binding sites and protein kinase genes, were inherited as single loci. Linkages between molecular markers and stripe rust resistance genes were detected. This technique provides a new way to develop molecular markers for assessing the genetic diversity of germplasm based upon potential candidate resistance genes in diverse species.

AB Comparative mapping of cDNA clones provides an important foundation for examining structural conservation among the chromosomes of diverse genera and for establishing hypotheses about the relationship between gene structure and function in a wide range of organisms. In this study, "anchor probes" were selected from cDNA libraries developed from rice, oat, and barley that were informative for comparative mapping in the grass family. One thousand eight hundred probes were screened on garden blots containing DNA of rice, maize, sorghum, sugarcane, wheat, barley, and oat, and 152 of them were selected as "anchors" because (1) they hybridized to the majority of target grass species based on Southern analysis, (2) they appeared to be low or single copy in rice, and (3) they helped provide reasonably good genome coverage in all species. Probes were screened for polymorphism on mapping parents, and polymorphic markers were mapped onto existing species-specific linkage maps of rice, oat, maize, and wheat. In wheat, both polymorphic and monomorphic markers could be assigned to chromosomes or chromosome arms based on hybridization to nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic stocks. Linkage among anchored loci allowed the identification of homoeologous regions of these distantly related genomes. Anchor probes were sequenced from both ends, providing an average of 260 bp in each direction, and sequences were deposited in GenBank. BLAST was used to compare the sequences with each other and with a nonredundant protein sequence database maintained at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). Of the anchor probes identified in this study 78% showed significant similarity to protein sequences for known genes with BLASTX scores exceeding 100.

AB An isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens (SBW25) was modified with different marker genes (lacZY, aph-1, and xylE). These marker genes were inserted singly or id combination into two separate (1 Mbp apart) and presumably nonessential sites (-6- and Eel on the chromosome of SBW25, This allowed the production of a range of genetically modified SBW25 variants that differed with respect to insertion site of the marker genes and metabolic burden. The environmental fitness of the different SBW25 variants was tested in soil, in the rhizosphere of wheat and pea, and on the phylloplane of wheat. Reduced environmental fitness of the different variants was mainly attributed to the extra metabolic burden of novel gene expression, whereas choice of insertion site was of little significance. Changes in environmental fitness were dependent on the environmental conditions; an environment, such as soil, with a low microbial carrying capacity had a negative effect on the environmental fitness of variants with a large metabolic load. In environments with a larger carrying capacity, such as the rhizosphere of pea, environmental fitness of variants with a large metabolic load was not significantly different from that of variants with a smaller metabolic burden.

   PURIFICATION; DESICCATION; INFECTION; PLANTS
AB Germin, a molecular marker of wheat embryo germination, is a protease-resistant, apoplastic, homopentameric glycoprotein with peroxide-generating oxalate oxidase activity. The spatial specificity of germin-like oxalate oxidase (gl-OXO) gene expression has been determined in tissues of germinating wheat embryos by a combination of histochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization techniques. The synthesis and accumulation of gl-OXO mRNA and protein is localised within the enveloping tissues of the embryonic axis (particularly the coleorhiza) during the first 24 h of imbibition. By 48 h germination, gl-OXO accumulation is detected throughout the root, with the exception of the postmitotic zone of cell elongation, where accumulation of its transcript is restricted to outer cell layers. At this time in the elongating shoot, gl-OXO is restricted to the coleoptile where it is detected only in the epidermal cell layer, the vascular bundles and bundle sheath cells. In older seedlings (approximately 9 days post-imbibition) gl-OXO activity is detected in leaves, but only within the vascular bundles. These patterns of expression are consistent with the hypothesis that the biological function of gl-OXO is to restrict cell growth by participating in cell-wall restructuring through the local provision of hydrogen peroxide for cross-linking of wall components.

AB A gene determining the restoration of cytoplasmic genic male sterility (CMS) caused by the Gulzow (G)-type cytoplasm was mapped by analyzing an F-2 and F-3 population comprising 140 and 133 individual plants, respectively. The target gene, designated Rfg1, was mapped on chromosome 4RL distally to three RFLP (Xpsr119, Xpsr167, Xpsr899) and four RAPD (XP01, XAP05, XR11, XS10) loci. Xpsr167 and Xpsr899 are known to be located on the segment of chromosome 4RL which was ancestrally translocated and is homoeologous to the distal end of other Triticeae 6S chromosomes. It is suggested that Rfg1 may be allelic to the gene determining the restoration of rye CMS caused by the Pampa (P) cytoplasm (chromosome 4RL) and to Rfc4 that on rye addition lines of chromosome 4RL restores male fertility of hexaploid wheat with T. timopheevi cytoplasm. Homoeoallelism to two loci for cytoplasmic-male-sterility restoration on chromosomes 6AS and 6BS in hexaploid wheat is also suggested.

AB Bulked segregant analysis and comparative mapping were applied to identify molecular markers linked to the Rfo restorer gene used for the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male-sterility system in rapeseed. These markers were then used to localise the radish introgression on the B. napus genetic map constructed from the cross 'Darmor.bzh' x 'Yudal'. The introgression mapped on the DY15 linkage group. From the comparison of this latter group to the linkage group constructed on a F-2 progeny segregating for the radish introgression, it was concluded that the introgression had occurred through homoeologous recombination, that it was not distal and that it had replaced a B. napus region of around 50 cM. A QTL involved in aliphatic seed glucosinolate content was located on the DY15 linkage group at a position corresponding to one end of the introgression. The DNA markers identified in this study are being used in map-based cloning of the Rfo gene and in marker-assisted selection.

AB This study describes the inheritance and linkage map positions of two low phytic acid barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutations, lpa1-1 and lpa2-1, that dramatically reduce grain phytic acid content and increase inorganic seed phosphorus (P). Wide-cross, Fz mapping populations were constructed by mating six-rowed varieties,'Steptoe' and/or 'Morex', with two-rowed 'Harrington' Ipa donor lines homozygous for either lpal-1 or lpa2-1. The barley Ipa1-1 mutation showed normal inheritance patterns, whereas a deficiency of homozygous lpn2-1/lpa2-1 F(2) plants was observed. We identified a codominant, STS-PCR marker (aMSU21) that cosegregated with lpn1-1 in a population of 41 F(2) plants. The aMSU21 marker was then mapped to a locus on barley chromosome 2H, using a North American Barley Genome Mapping Project (NABGMP) doubled haploid population ('Harrington' x 'Morex'). We determined that lpa2-1 is located within a recombination interval of approximately 30 cM between two AFLP markers that were subsequently mapped to barley chromosome 7H by integration with the same NABGMP population. Recent comparative mapping studies indicate conserved genetic map orders of several homologous molecular marker loci in maize and the Triticeae species that also show corresponding linkage to the biochemically similar lpa2 mutations of maize and barley. This observation suggests that barley and maize lpa2 mutations may affect orthologous genes. No such evidence for correspondence of the phenotypically similar lpa1 mutations of barley and maize has been revealed.

AB A barley lambda-phage library was screened with (GA)n and (GT)n probes for developing microsatellite markers. The number of repeats ranged from 2 to 58 for GA and from 2 to 24 for GT. Fifteen selected microsatellite markers were highly polymorphic for barley. These microsatellite markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity among 163 barley genotypes chosen from the collection of the IPK Genebank, Germany. A total of 130 alleles were detected by 15 barley microsatellite markers. The number of alleles per microsatellite marker varied from 5 to 15. On average 8.6 alleles per locus were observed. Except for GMS004 all other barley microsatellite markers showed on average a high value of gene diversity ranging from 0.64 to 0.88. The mean value of gene diversity in the wild forms and landraces was 0.74, and even among the cultivars the gene diversity ranged from 0.30 to 0.86 with a mean of 0.72. No significant differences in polymorphism were detected by the GA and GT microsatellite markers. The estimated genetic distances revealed by the microsatellite markers were, on average, 0.75 for the wild forms, 0.72 for landraces and 0.70 among cultivars. The microsatellite markers were able to distinguish between different barley genotypes. The high degree of polymorphisms of microsatellite markers allows a rapid and efficient identification of barley genotypes.

AB The chomosomal location of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene was determined in both hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The GST cDNA used to map the gene was cloned from the diploid wheat Triticum tauschii. GST loci were located on the short arms of chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D in T. aestivum and also on the short arm of chromosome 6H in H. vulgare. The GST locus in barley was absolutely linked to the RFLP marker E148A and was located 0.8 cM proximal to the RFLP marker ABC169B on barley chromosome 6H. At least two copies of the GST gene were present in each of the T. aestivum A, B, and D genomes, and a homologous GST gene was present as a single-copy gene in the barley genome. GST mRNA transcripts were not detected in RNA isolated from shoots of control (unsafened) seedlings of T. tauschii or T. aestivum. It was determined that the expression of the GST gene was regulated by herbicide safener treatment in T. tauschii and T. aestivum by detecting safener-increased GST mRNA transcript levels.

AB A size-selected genomic library from Elymus alaskanus was screened for the presence of (GA)(n), (GT)(n), (CAC)(n),, and (TCT)(n) microsatellite sequences. A total of 28 positive clones were found for the two dinucleotide repeats, whereas no positive clones were found for the trinucleotide repeats. Positive clones were sequenced to validate the presence of microsatellites and to generate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, based on the sequences flanking: the microsatellite. Primer pairs were designed and evaluated for 18 selected microsatellites. The resulting loci were analysed by PCR for their usefulness as molecular markers in an array of 18 accessions representing E. alaskanus and 10 other Elymus species. PCR amplification revealed alleles for the 18 loci, which varied in having 1-10 alleles in these, accessions. In the 18 accessions tested, 7 of the 18 loci were polymorphic, with gene diversity values ranging from 0.54 to 0.80 among all species. Within E. alaskanus, gene diversity values ranged from 0.20 to 0.72, with a mean of 0.48. Polymorphism was also detected within accessions. No clear relationship between total repeat length and the degree of polymorphism was observed in this study. Primer pairs designed to amplify microsatellites in E. alaskanus can be used to generate polymorphism products in other species within the genus. Hence, microsatellites are useful markers for studying both inter- and intra-specific genetic variability within Elymus.

AB This paper reports the start of a molecular cytogenetics programme targeting the genome of the angiosperm tree species Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg. (rubber, 2n = 36), a major world crop about whose genetics very little is known. A metaphase karyotype of rubber is presented. In situ hybidization with the probe pTa71 for ribosomal DNA (rDNA) shows that there are four sites of probe hybidization occurring on two pairs of chromosomes called chromosomes 6 and 7 carrying sites NOR-1 and NOR-2, respectively. An examination of meristematic interphase nuclei shows that all four loci have the potential to be partially decondensed at interphase, although in many nuclei one or more loci appear fully condensed and apparently inactive. The probe pXVI revealed a single pair of chromosomes carrying 5S rDNA. The probes pTa71 and pXVI provide cytogenetic markers for three pairs of chromosomes that will be of use in genetic mapping programmes. The rubber chromosomes also have telomere sequences that hybridize with the Arabidopsis consensus sequence TTTAGGG. With the exception of the satellite region containing rDNA, which fluoresces brightly with chromomycin A(3), fluorescence banding showed that there is no strong demarcation of the genome into GC- and AT-rich regions, as occurs in mammalian genomes.

AB Bone and liver alkaline phosphatases are the predominant alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzymes in serum and are the product of a single gene. Methodologies including heat inactivation, chemical inhibition, wheat germ lectin precipitation, and electrophoresis developed over the past decades to quantitate bone ALP in serum are thought to exploit the carbohydrate differences between bone and liver ALP, Recent advancements in assay technology for serum bone ALP quantitation have included the development of monoclonal antibodies with high specificity for bone ALP, These antibodies have been used to develop immunoassays in various formats that allow more widespread use in clinical chemistry laboratories, Clinical data demonstrate that bone ALP is a sensitive and reliable indicator of bone metabolism. Although a direct product of the osteoblast, the cell that forms bone during bone remodeling, bone ALP reflects overall bone turnover when the bone resorption and formation processes remain coupled. In osteoporosis, measurement of serum bone ALP can be an effective tool in monitoring response to osteoporosis therapies and may also be useful in assessing a woman's risk of subsequent bone loss and fracture.

AB We investigated the role in pathogenesis of bacterial resistance to plant antimicrobial peptides. The sapA to sapF (for sensitive to antimicrobial peptides) operon from the pathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi has been characterized. It has five open reading frames that are closely related (71% overall amino acid identity) and are in the same order as those of the sapA to sapF operon from Salmonella typhimurium. An E. chrysanthemi sap mutant strain was constructed by marker exchange. This mutant was more sensitive than was the wild type to wheat a-thionin and to snakin-1, which is the most abundant antimicrobial peptide from potato tubers. This mutant was also less virulent than was the wild-type strain in potato tubers: lesion area was 37% that of the control, and growth rate was two orders of magnitude lower. These results indicate that the interaction of antimicrobial peptides from the host with the sapA to sapF operon from the pathogen plays a similar role in animal and in plant bacterial pathogenesis.

AB We have identified an Arabidopsis mutant that displays enhanced disease resistance to the fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum, causal agent of powdery mildew. The edr1 mutant does not constitutively express the pathogenesis-related genes PR-I, BGL2, or PR-5 and thus differs from previously described disease-resistant mutants of Arabidopsis. E. cichoracearum conidia (asexual spores) germinated normally and formed extensive hyphae on edr1 plants, indicating that the initial stages of infection were not inhibited. Production of conidiophores on edr1 plants, however, was <16% of that observed on wild-type Arabidopsis. Reduction in sporulation correlated with a more rapid induction of defense responses. Autofluorescent compounds and callose accumulated in edr1 leaves 3 days after inoculation with E. cichoracearum, and dead mesophyll cells accumulated in edr1 leaves starting 5 days after inoculation. Macroscopic patches of dead cells appeared 6 days after inoculation. This resistance phenotype is similar to that conferred by "late-acting" powdery mildew resistance genes of wheat and barley. The edr1 mutation is recessive and maps to chromosome 1 between molecular markers ATEAT1 and NCC1. We speculate that the edr1 mutation derepresses multiple defense responses, making them more easily induced by virulent pathogens.

AB Existing PCR-based assays for the detection of the cereal pathogen Fusarium avenaceum were found to cross-react with F. tricinctum. An investigation into the phenetic relationship between these two species using two different marker systems revealed a close relationship between them despite their being from separate taxonomic sections. Whilst RFLP differences in the ITS regions surrounding the nuclear 5.8 S rDNA were insufficient to discriminate between isolates of the two species, they were clearly differentiated by RAPD profiling. RAPD fragments from E avenaceum isolates were screened for hybridization to F, tricinctum DNA on Southern blots. One of 12 selected RAPD fragments showed no hybridization to genomic DNA from F. tricinctum. This fragment was cloned and sequenced, and the sequence obtained was used to design PCR primers. The primers were found to be specific for F. avenaceum, with no cross-reactions obtained with F. tricinctum or any other wheat pathogen assayed. The primers were able to differentiate between the two species in infected plant material, in contrast to the earlier assays.

AB Two sets of single chromosome recombinant lines comparing 2D chromosomes from the wheat varieties 'Ciano 67' and 'Mara' with the common 2D chromosome of 'Cappelle-Desprez' in a 'Cappelle-Desprez' background were used to detect a diagnostic wheat microsatellite marker for the dwarfing gene Rht8. The genetic linkage maps place the wheat microsatellite marker WMS 261 0.6 cM distal to Rht8 on the short arm of chromosome 2D. By PCR analysis the WMS 261 alleles of 'Mara', 'Cappelle-Desprez' and 'Ciano 67' could be distinguished by different fragment sizes of 192 bp, 174 bp and 165 bp: respectively. A screen of over 100 international varieties of wheat showed that the three allelic variants were all widespread. It also demonstrated that a limited number of varieties carried novel WMS 261 variants of over 200 bp. Following classification of the individual recombinant lines for allelic variants at the WMS 261 locus it was possible to attribute a 7- to 8-cm reduction in plant height with the WMS 261-192-bp allele compared to the WMS 261-174-bp allele in the set of recombinant Lines comparing 2D chromosomes of 'Mara' and 'Cappelle-Desprez'. A height reduction of around 3 cm was detected between the WMS 261-174-bp allele and the WMS 261-165-bp allele in the recombinant lines comparing 2D chromosomes of 'Cappelle-Desprez' and 'Ciano 67'.

AB Wheat microsatellite WMS 261 whose 192-bp allele has been shown to be diagnostic for the commercially important dwarfing gene Rht8 was used to screen over 100 wheat varieties to determine the worldwide spread of Rht8. The results showed Rht8 to be widespread in southern European wheats and to be present in many central European wheats including the Russian varieties 'Avrora', 'Bezostaya' and 'Kavkaz'. Rht8 appears to be of importance to South European wheats as alternative giberellic acid (GA)-insensitive dwarfing genes do not appear to be adapted to this environment. The very successful semi-dwarf varieties bred by CIMMYT, Mexico? for distribution worldwide have been thought to carry Rht8 combined with GA-insensitive dwarfing genes. Additional height reduction would have been obtained from pleiotropic effects of the photoperiod-response gene Ppd1 that is essential to the adaptability of varieties bred for growing under short-winter days in tropical and sub-tropical areas. The microsatellite analysis showed that CIMMYT wheats lack Rht8 and carry a WMS 261 allelic variant of 165 bp that has been associated with promoting height. This presumably has adaptive significance in partly counteracting the effects of other dwarfing genes and preventing the plants being too short. Most UK, German and French wheats carry an allelic variant at the WMS 261 locus with 174 bp. This could be selected because of linkage with the recessive photoperiod-sensitive ppd1 allele that is thought to offer adaptive significance northern European wheats.

AB RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analysis was used to identify molecular markers linked to the Dn2 gene conferring resistance to the Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko).,A set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) was screened with 300 RAPD primers for polymorphisms linked to the Dn2 gene. A total of 2700 RAPD loci were screened for linkage to the resistance locus. Four polymorphic RAPD fragments; two in coupling phase and two in repulsion phase, were identified as putative RAPD markers for the Dn2 gene. Segregation analysis of these markers in an F-2 population segregating for the resistance gene revealed that all four markers were closely linked to the Dn2 locus. Linkage distances ranged from 3.3 cM to 4.4 cM. Southern analysis of the RAPD products using the cloned RAPD markers as probes confirmed the homology of the RAPD amplification products. The coupling-phase marker OPB10(880c) and the repulsion-phase marker OPN1(400r) were converted to sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. SCAR analysis of the F-2 population and other resistant and susceptible South African wheat cultivars corroborated the observed linkage of the RAPD markers to the Dn2 resistance locus. These markers will be useful for marker-assisted selection of the Dn2 gene for resistance breeding and-gene pyramiding.

DE Triticum aestivum L.; grain softness protein
ID SOFTNESS PROTEIN; KERNEL HARDNESS; STARCH; LINKAGE; GENES; SEED
AB "Soft" and "hard" are the two main market classes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and are distinguished by expression of the Hardness gene. Friabilin, a marker protein for grain softness (Ha), consists of two proteins, puroindoline a and b (pinA and pinB, respectively), We previously demonstrated that a glycine to serine mutation in pinB is linked inseparably to grain hardness, Here, we report that the pinB serine mutation is present in 9 of 13 additional randomly selected hard wheats and in none of 10 soft wheats. The four exceptional hard wheats not containing the serine mutation in pinB express no pinA, the remaining component of the marker protein friabilin. The absence of pinA protein was linked inseparably to grain hardness among 44 near-isogenic lines created between the soft variety Heron and the hard variety Falcon. Both pinA and pinB apparently are required for the expression of grain softness. The absence of pinA protein and transcript and a glycine-to-serine mutation in pinB are two highly conserved mutations associated with grain hardness, and these friabilin genes are the suggested tightly linked components of the Hardness gene. A previously described grain hardness related gene termed "GSP-1" (grain softness protein) is not controlled by chromosome 5D and is apparently not involved in grain hardness, The association of grain hardness with mutations in both pinA or pinB indicates that these two proteins alone may function together to effect grain softness. Elucidation of the molecular basis for grain hardness opens the way to understanding and eventually manipulating this wheat endosperm property.

AB Plant transformation requires a method far an early detection of transgenic plants. A strategy based in dot blot hybridization is described for that purpose. Two to five genes were introduced into wheat genome by microparticle bombardment. DNA was obtained and purified from 1-month-old experimental plants and was fixed onto membranes and hybridized with radioactive probes, labeled by random priming or PCR. Fifty-six transgenic plants were identified out of almost 1,300 analyzed. Dot blot was also used to analyze the progenies of transgenic plants. The integration and expression of transgenes were confirmed by Southern hybridization and enzyme activity suggesting that the method is suitable for the described purpose.

AB Plant height in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) is known to be under polygenic control. Crosses involving genes Rht-B1 and Rht-D1, located on chromosomes 4BS and 4DS, respectively, have shown that these genes have major effects. Two RFLP loci were found to be linked to these two genes (Xfbal-4B with Rht-B1 and Xfba211-4D with Rht-D1) by genotyping a population of F-1-derived doubled-haploid lines ['Courtot' (Rht-B1b + Rht-D1b) x 'Chinese Spring']. Using a well-covered molecular marker map, we detected three additional regions and one interaction influencing plant height. These regions, located on chromosome arms 4BS (near the locus Xglk556-4B), 7AL (near the locus Xglk478-7A) and 7BL (near the locus XksuD2-7B) explained between 5% and 20% of the variability for this trait in this cross. The influence of 2 loci from chromosome 4B (Xfbal-4B and Xglk556-4B) suggests that there could be a duplication of Rht-B1 on this chromosome originating from Cv 'Courtot'. Moreover, an interaction effect between loci from chromosome arms 1AS (near the locus Xfba393-1A) and 1BL (near the locus Xcdo1188-1B) was comparable to or even higher than those of the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b alleles. A model including the main effects of the loci from chromosomes 4B and 4D (Xfbal-4B, Xglk556-4B and Xfba211-4D) and the interaction effect between Xfba393-1A and Xcdo1188-1B is proposed, which explains about 50% of the variation inplant height. The present results are discussed in relation to those obtained using nullisomic or substitution lines.

AB The mammalian cornea receives a dense sensory innervation and a modest sympathetic innervation. The purpose of the current study was to determine if the rat cornea is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves. In the first set of experiments, unilateral combined sympathetic and sensory ocular denervations were performed in adult rats by surgical removal of the superior cervical ganglion and intracranial transection of the trigeminal ophthalmomaxillary nerve. Completeness of the denervation procedure was verified postmortem by a variety of macroscopic and immunohistochemical methods. Five to twelve days later, the corneas were serially sectioned tangential to the ocular surface and processed immunohistochemically with antibodies against the pan-neuronal markers, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP-9.5) and peripherin. In every animal a small, but constant, population of corneal and limbal immunoreactive fibers were unaffected by the surgical denervations and were concluded to derive from parasympathetic ganglia. In the second set of experiments, the origins of the rat corneal innervation were determined by applying the neuroanatomical tracer, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) to the central cornea. Two to four days later, the trigeminal, superior cervical, ciliary, accessory ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia were sectioned and analysed for the presence of HRP-labeled neurons. Examination of the corneal application site and associated ocular tissues revealed no evidence of tracer spread into neighbouring structures, Small numbers (0-6 per animal) of HRP-labeled neurons were observed in the ipsilateral ciliary and accessory ciliary ganglia of most animals. The results of these carefully controlled studies provide strong anatomical evidence of a modest parasympathetic innervation of the rat cornea. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

For each species and each rDNA family, the position and number of sires in the various cytotypes suggested the presence of one locus and basic chromosome numbers of 10 for Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum robustum and 8 for Saccharum spontaneum. The implications of these results for the genetic maps of modern cultivars derived from crosses between the species S. officinarum and S. spontaneum are discussed.

AB 5S ribosomal gene spacer sequences from the short-spacer arrays of wheat and rye were isolated by PCR. The 29 new DNA sequences displayed noticeable heterogeneity at scattered positions. Nevertheless, based on shared DNA sequence polymorphisms, sequence alignment clearly classified the sequences into three groups. Group-specific primer sets were designed to allow chromosomal assignment by PCR on nullitetrasomic wheat stocks, as well as on wheat-rye translocation and addition lines. The three groups were assigned to orthologous loci 5S-Rma-B1, 5S-Rrna-D1, and 5S-Rma-R1 on homoeologous chromosomes 1B, 1D, and 1R, respectively. Hence, group-specific DNA sequence variation could be related to fixed orthologous DNA sequence variation between 5S rRNA multigene families on the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. In addition, members of the three groups showed fixed orthologous length polymorphism. Four sequenced 5S-Rma-B1 units, however, had a duplication in the gene encoding region and are probably representatives of a nontranscribed subfamily of 5S rDNA repeating units. The observed chromosome-specific polymorphisms among sequences belonging to a multigene family with thousands of copies suggests that this type of polymorphism may exist in many genes and gene families in polyploid wheats. The implication of this finding in relation to the construction of molecular tools for wheat-genome analysis and manipulation is discussed.

AB Microsatellite markers represent a new class of genetic markers in plants. Such markers reveal a high level of polymorphism even in species with a narrow genetic base, such as hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We used a large set of such markers and 25 deletion stocks of 'Chinese Spring' in a deletion-mapping experiment to study the physical distribution of dinucleotide microsatellite markers in homoeologous group 2 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat. Thirty-one microsatellite markers identified 14 loci in chromosome 2A, 9 loci in chromosome 2B, and 10 loci in chromosome 2D. The microsatellite loci were evenly distributed along the chromosome length, marking 18 of 27 defined physical intervals, including centromeric, interstitial, and telomeric regions. The apparent random distribution indicates that microsatellite markers provide excellent coverage of the wheat genome.

AB It is known that germin, which is a marker of the onset of growth in germinating wheat, is an oxalate oxidase, and also that germins possess sequence similarity with legumin and vicilin seed storage proteins. These two pieces of Information have been combined in order to generate a 3D model of germin based on the structure of vicilin and to examine the model with regard to a potential oxalate oxidase active site. A cluster of three histidine residues has been located within the conserved beta-barrel structure. While there is a relatively low level of overall sequence similarity between the model and the vicilin structures, the conservation of amino acids important in maintaining the scaffold of the beta-barrel lends confidence to the juxtaposition of the histidine residues. The cluster is similar structurally to those found in copper amine oxidase and other proteins, leading to the suggestion that it defines a metal-binding location within the oxalate oxidase active site. It is also proposed that the structural elements involved in Intermolecular interactions in vicilins may play a role in oligomer formation in germin/oxalate oxidase.

AB The lectin soybean agglutinin (SBA) from Glycine max binds to small-sized dorsal root ganglion cells and their central terminals in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Here we investigated the ability of SBA and SBA conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(SBA-HRP) to trace thin calibre afferents into the spinal cord from a peripheral nerve. Following injection into the sciatic nerve, labelled cells in the dorsal root ganglion were predominantly small-sized but some medium-sized cells were also labelled. Colocalisation studies of transported SBA with Various neuronal markers showed that all neurons that transported SBA-HRP showed SBA binding, indicating high uptake specificity for the conjugate. 15% were immunoreactive for RT97 indicating that some axons were myelinated, and 54% also expressed binding sites for isolectin B4 from Griffonia simplicifolia, a selective marker for a subpopulation of unmyelinated afferents. With regard to neurotransmitter content, 43% of the SBA cells contained calcitonin gene-related peptide, 33% contained substance P and 2.5% somatostatin. In addition, 3% contained carbonic anhydrase. Centrally, injection of SBA in the sciatic nerve resulted in labelled terminals in somatotopically appropriate regions of laminae I-II of the dorsal horn, and in the gracile nucleus. A few neurons in the dorsal horn were labelled indicating that some transneuronal transport of SBA had occurred. The results show that SBA can be used as a transganglionic tracer to label fine calibre primary afferents that project to laminae I-II of the spinal cord and the gracile nucleus. It appears to label more afferents than isolectin B4, including also a subpopulation of myelinated afferents.

AB Osmotic adjustment (OA) was previously demonstrated to be an important adaptive mechanism of drought tolerance in cereals. In order to determine which genomic regions are involved in OA variation, 187 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Tadmor (drought tolerant) and Er/Apm (susceptible) were studied in a growth chamber for their OA capacity (through correlated traits and by calculation), at an early growth stage and under two water treatments (soil moisture of 14% and 100% of field capacity). The continuous distribution of the traits and their broad-sense line heritabilities. ranging from 0.04 to 0.44, indicated that OA and related traits should have a polygenic nature. A subset of 167 RILs were also genotyped using 78 RFLP, 32 RAPD and three morphological markers and a linkage map was constructed. Despite strong environmental effects acting on the traits, interval mapping and single-marker ANOVA allowed the detection of three QTLs for relative water content (RWC), four QTLs for osmotic potential (psi(pi)), two QTLs of osmotic potential at full turgor (psi(pi)100) and one QTL for osmotic adjustment at a soil moisture of 14% field capacity. For the irrigated treatment, only two QTLs were detected: one for RWC and one for psi(pi)100. Two chromosomal regions were involved in several OA-related trait variations and could be considered as regions controlling OA; these were present on chromosome 1 (7H) and chromosome 6 (6H), whereas other regions were specific for one trait. No major QTL was found. However, the genomic region involved in OA-related traits on chromosome 1 (7H) in barley seemed to be conserved for OA variation among cereals. Epistatic effects, with or without additive effects, acted on the traits.

AB We investigated the feasibility of cold hardiness manipulation in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., with the Vrn1-Fr1 interval on chromosome 5AL. The interval contains a gene(s) that has influenced vernalization requirements and cold hardiness levels. We conducted LT50 tests (lethal temperature of 50% of plants) on wheat NILs (near-isogenic lines) that differed for alleles at the Vrn1-Fr1 interval, to determine the effects of the interval on cold hardiness levels between hardy and nonhardy wheat. The Mts were derived from five backcrosses between a spring wheat recurrent parent,'Marfed', and two winter wheat donor parents, 'Suweon 185' and 'Chugoku 81', hardy and nonhardy, respectively. The developed populations were Suweon 185/6*Marfed and Chugoku 81/6*Marfed spring and winter NILs. Results showed that the winter NILs could tolerate a 4.3 degrees C colder LT50 store than the spring NILs, and that the Suweon 185/6*Marfed winter Mts could tolerate a 0.5 degrees C colder LT50 than Chugoku 81/6*Marfed winter Mts. Results indicate that the Vrn1-Fr1 interval explained between 71 and 91% of the variation for LT50 scores between these genotypes. The Mts were analyzed with the probe Xwg644 to confirm linkage with the Vrn1-Fr1 interval and to determine its utility as a marker for vernalization requirement and cold hardiness. EcoRI-digested DNA of the winter and spring Mt wheat, probed with Xwg644, showed that a 9.7-kb band co-segregated with the winter growth habit. Results indicate that differences in cold hardiness levels between winter wheat cultivars may be explained by this interval and that the interval may be manipulated through plant breeding to improve the cold hardiness of cultivars.

AB Genetic complementation of a spontaneous mutant, impaired in flocculation, Congo red binding, and colonization of root surface, led to the identification of a new regulatory gene in Azospirillum brasilense Sp7, designated flcA. The deduced amino acid sequence of flcA shared high similarity with a family of transcriptional activators of the LuxR-UhpA family. The most significant match was with the AgmR protein, an activator for glycerol metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Derivatives of Sp7 resulting from site-directed Tn5 mutagenesis in the flcA coding sequence were constructed by marker exchange, Characterization of the resulting mutant strains showed that flcA controls the production of capsular polysaccharides, the flocculation process in culture, and the colonization of the root surface of wheat. This study provides new information on the genetic control of the mechanism of plant root colonization by Azospirillum.

AB Five wheat-triticale doubled haploid (DH) lines - M08, V209, DH220-14-2, DH696-3-4 and M16 - derived from anther culture of F(1)s resulting from crosses involving hexaploid or octoploid triticale x hexaploid wheat, were characterized by cytological and biochemical markers. Cytological evidence from genomic in situ hybridization and C-banding indicated that DH lines M08 and V209 (2n = 42) each contained a pair of 1BL/1RS translocation chromosomes. DH220-14-2 (2n = 42) was also a translocated line with two pairs of chromosomes containing small fragments of rye. One of the translocation fragments carried the Sec-1R gene originating from the satellite region of 1RS; the origin of the other one remains unknown. DH696-3-4 (2n = 42) contained a 3D(3R) substitution. In M16 (2n = 44), three pairs of rye chromosomes, 3R, 4R and 6R, were present, 4R as an addition and 3D(3R) and 6D(6R) as substitutions. Biochemical, isozyme and storage protein markers confirmed the cytological conclusions. The advantages of transferring alien chromosomes or chromosome fragments into wheat and creating alien aneuploid lines by anther culture of hybrid F(1)s are discussed.

AB To identify and locate rye DNA sequences homologous to three wheat c-DNAs (wali1, wali2 and wali5) whose expression is induced by aluminium (Al) stress, we designed three pairs of specific primers, They were used in the amplification of genomic DNA from wheat-rye disomic addition lines. The wali2 pair of primers amplified a 878-bp rye DNA fragment (rali2) located on chromosomes 4R and 7R that showed 79.37% homology with the corresponding wheat c-DNA. RAPD fragments were also used as genetic markers. We located 22 different RAPDs distributed on II different rye chromosome arms using wheat-rye disomic and ditelocentric addition lines. Thirteen of these markers were located on the chromosomes 3R, 4R and 6R, which also carry aluminium-tolerance genes. The OPA08(415) and OPR01(600) RAPD markers, located on the 6RL and 6RS chromosome arms, respectively. were converted to SCAR markers (SCA08(415) and SCR01(600)) and linked to Alt1 gene (SCR01(600)-2.1 cM-Alt1-33.5 cM-SCA08(415)). We propose that the chromosomal location of RAPDs and SCARs using wheat-rye addition lines is a source of DNA markers linked to aluminium-tolerance loci and offers a valuable strategy in marker-assisted selection for the introgression of tolerance genes in wheat.

AB Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used to characterise the genetic diversity of wheat (Triticum aestivum) germplasm, One hundred and twenty-four accessions comprising all major Australian wheat varieties and lines important for breeding purposes were assayed for RFLPs with clones of known genetic location and selected to give uniform genome coverage. The objectives of this study were to determine RFLP-based genetic similarity between accessions and to derive associations between agronomically significant traits and RFLP phenotypes. Ninety-eight probes screened against genomic DNA digested with five restriction endonucleases detected a total of 1968 polymorphic fragments, Genetic similarity (GS) calculated from the RFLP data ranged from 0.004 to 0.409 between accessions, with a mean of 0.18. Cluster analysis based on GS estimates produced four groupings that were generally consistent with available pedigree information, Comparisons of the RFLP phenotypes of accessions containing disease resistance genes present on introgressed alien segments enabled the identification of specific alleles characteristic of these regions. Associations were derived for a range of stem-rust, leaf-rust and yellow-rust resistance genes, These results suggest that RFLP analysis can be used for the characterisation and grouping of elite breeding material of wheat and RFLP profiling can identify chromosome segments associated with agronomic traits.

AB The wcs120 gene is specifically induced by low temperature (LT) and encodes a protein that is thought to play an important role in the cold acclimation process in wheat, To identify the regulatory elements involved in its LT responsiveness, the transient expression activity of different promoter regions was determined using the luciferase reporter gene, The data indicate the involvement of putative enhancer elements, negative and positive regulatory regions in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. The promoter was found to be cold-inducible in different freezing-tolerant and -sensitive monocot and dicot species, suggesting that universal transcription factors responsive to LT may be present in all plants, This promoter could be used to drive the genes needed for LT tolerance in sensitive species.

AB The objectives of this study were to map and tag the previously undescribed eyespot resistance gene PchDv on chromosome 4V of Dasypyrum villosum in a wheat background. The 82 F-2 plants used for mapping were produced from a cross between a susceptible wheat 'Yangmai-5' (4V(4D)) substitution line and a resistant wheat 'Chinese Spring' disomic addition line of chromosome 4V of D. villosum. Segregation for resistance and susceptibility among F-2 plants was 3:1, indicating that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. PchDv mapped to the distal part of chromosome 4V and was bracketed by two RFLP markers, Xcdo949 and Xbcd588, in a 33-cM interval. This distance could not be reduced, owing to a lack of polymorphic loci in this region. Theoretically, double recombination in this region occurs in 3.3% of the individuals; therefore, 96.7% of the selected genotypes would have PchDv, with simultaneous selection for both flanking markers. Double recombination between, the flanking markers was observed in 2 out of 82 (2.4%) F-2 individuals.

AB The effects of an antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens strain (F113) carrying die marker gene cassette lacZY and a marked, non-producing strain (F113G22) on the uptake of nitrogen from N-15 enriched organic residues incorporated into a sandy soil were investigated in microcosm studies. Strain F113 produces the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), while its modified derivative strain F113G22 has DAPG production deleted by Tn5 mutagenesis. Uptake of nitrogen by pea (Pisum sativum) was estimated using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. In addition, plant growth and microbial activity in soil were monitored. Both strains F113 and F113G22 enhanced the uptake of nitrogen from mineralized organic residues, even though the antibiotic producing strain F113 significantly reduced microbial activity in soil. It is suggested that the effect on nitrogen uptake was due to increased mineralization of organic residues by the introduced organisms, making greater quantities of inorganic nitrogen available for plant uptake. Unlike studies assessing impact in terms of perturbation to indigenous microbial communities, this study provides direct evidence of a change in ecosystem function as a result of the introduction of strains of a genetically marked bacterium, Irrespective of whether its natural antibiotic-producing capacity has been genetically deleted.

AB A major gene for resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp, tritici = Elysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) has been successfully transferred into hexaploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) from wild einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum subsp, aegilopoides, 2n = 2x = 14, AA). NC96BGTA5 is a germ plasm line with the pedigree Saluda x 3/PI427662. The response patterns for powdery mildew resistance in NC96BGTA5 were tested with 30 differential isolates of B. graminis f. sp. tritici, and the line was resistant to all tested isolates. The analyses of P-1, P-2, F-1, F-2, and BC1F1 populations derived from NC96BGTA5 revealed two genes for wheat powdery mildew resistance in the NC96BGTA5 line. One gene, Pm3a, was from its recurrent parent Saluda, and the second was a new gene introgressed from wild einkorn wheat. The gene was determined to be different from Pml to Pm21 by gene-for-gene and pedigree analyses. The new gene was identified as linked to the Pm3a gene based on the F-2 and BC1F1 populations derived from a cross between NC96BGTA5 and a susceptible cultivar NK-Coker 68-15, and the data indicated that the gene was located on chromosome 1A. It is proposed that this new gene be designated Pm25 for wheat powdery mildew resistance in NC96BGTA5. Three random amplified polymorphic DNA markers, OPX06(1050), OPAG04(950), and OPAI14(600), were found to be linked to this new gene.

AB Chinese accessions of Triticum tauschii and T. aestivum L. from the Sichuan white (SW), Yunnan hulled (YH), Tibetan weedrace (TW), and Xinjiang rice (XR) wheat groups were subjected to RFLP analysis. T. tauschii and landraces of T. aestivum from countries in Southwest Asia were also evaluated. For T. tauschii, a west to east gradient was apparent where the Chinese accessions exhibited less diversity than those from Southwest Asia. Compared to the Southwest Asian gene pool, the Chinese T. tauschii was highly homogeneous giving a low frequency of polymorphic bands (16%) and banding patterns (1.33 per probe) with 75 RFLP probe-HindIII combinations. Accessions of T. tauschii from Afghanistan and Pakistan were genetically more similar to the Chinese T. tauschii than those from Iran. Of 368 bands found for 39 Chinese hexaploid wheat accessions with 63 RFLP probe-HindIII combinations, 28.3% were polymorphic with an average of 2.6 banding patterns per probe and 5.0 bands per genotype. The individual Chinese landrace wheat groups revealed less variation than those from Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. When classified into country based groups, however, the diversity level over all Chinese landraces was greater than that of some Southwest Asian landraces, especially those from Afghanistan and Iran. The XR wheat group was genetically distinct from the other three Chinese landrace groups and was more related to the Southwest Asian landraces. The TW group was genetically similar to, but more diverse than, the SW and YI-I groups. The Chinese landraces had a higher degree of genetic relatedness to the Southwest Asian T. tauschii, particularly to accessions from Iran, rather than to the Chinese T. tauschii. 'Chinese Spring' was most related to 'Chengdu-guang-tou', a cultivar from the SW wheat group.

AB Wheat germin is a homopentameric 125 kD glycoprotein mainly localized in the cell wall of monocots, and is a specific marker of the onset of growth in germinating seeds. The major objective of this study was to examine the expression and oxalate oxidase activity of two wheat germin isoforms: gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 in transgenic tobacco plants. The transgenic tobacco plants were created with different constructs: 1) one entire excision of gf-2.8 germin promoter and two partially deleted promoter sequences were used to generate 3 independent GUS constructs; 2) the whole gf-2.8 gene construct and the fusion with CaMV 35S promoter; 3) one entire excision of gf-3.8 germin gene and one partially deleted gf-3.8 promoter sequences were used to generate 2 independent GUS constructs; 4) the whole gf-3.8 gene and the fusion with CaMV 35S promoter. Hormonal treatment.(auxin and gibberellin), salt treatment, heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, As) and Al induced high GUS activity in tobacco transformed with entire and one partially deleted of the gf-2.8 gene. The immunoblotting confirmed induction of gf-2.8 gene and its product expressed oxalate oxidase activity in tobacco transformed with the entire gf-2.8 construct. Neither nicotinic acid, salicylic acid, heat shock, cold nor UV-C have enhanced significant GUS activity and germin gf-2.8 synhesis and activity.
   The germin gf-3.8 constructs with GUS gene and with the entire gf-3.8 Sequences gave non-positive response with factors mentioned above. It has been demonstrated that gf-3.8 germin isoform is present as a monomer (M-r 25 kD). The non-active gf-3.8 protein is synthetised in transgenic tobacco plants only under control of the CaMV 35S promoter.
   Consequently, among two germin isoforms, only the gf-2.8 protein seems to be regulated by hormonal, salt and heavy metal factors. The gf-2.8 oxalate oxidase activity could be then involved in general stress-induced signalling in plant.

Southern analysis revealed single copy as well as multiple copy insertions of the bar and aphA transgenes. Inheritance of these selectable marker genes was demonstrated in the T-1 generation progenies.

AB Five sets of synthetic oligonucleotide (20- to 24-mers containing no intenal repeats) primers of known gene sequences [yellow Lupin nodule specific (hydroxyl) proline-rich protein, pearl millet alcohol dehydrogenase, Pisum sativum heat shock proteins, Drosophila homeobox, and tRNA] were used to differentiate 73 soybean accessions, including 56 Glycine max (L.) Merr. and 17 G. soja Zucc. & Sieb. The amplified genetic markers revealed polymorphic bands for most genotypes studied. The chi(2)-analyses of the results showed that several fragments produced with these gene primers were associated non-randomly with resistance to Phytophothora, maturity, seed size, flower colour, seed coat colour, seed hilum colour, growth type, and leaf shape. These markers appear to be valuable for differentiation of G. max and G, soja species and genotypes within these species.

AB Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP) levels are considered to reflect osteoblastic activity and can therefore be used as a marker of bone formation. However, bone ALP is difficult to distinguish from other ALP isoforms since the kidney, liver, and bone isoenzymes are encoded by the same gene and only differ because of posttranslational modification of their carbohydrate side chains. The aim of this study was to purify and separate bone ALP which could be used to raise specific antisera against human bone ALP, from Saos-2, a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line. The procedure involved two steps. The first step, cultivation of 10(5) Saos-2 cells, yielded approximately 1 U ALP. Subsequent butanol extraction achieved 1.82-fold purification. For the second step? separating bone ALP, we used serial lectin affinity chromatography to distinguish between the carbohydrate side chains of the various ALP isoforms. A sample of the butanol extract was fractionated into three peaks (I, II, and III) by concanavalin A. Peaks II and III were subsequently identified as types IIa and mb bone ALP using pea lectin and wheat germ agglutinin columns, respectively. The specific activity of bone ALP was measured using commercial kits. Since bone ALP accounted for at least 84% of the total ALP activity after the final separation, this method appears more convenient and reproducible than others using bone or Pagetic sera. The bone ALP purified in this study could be used to raise monoclonal antibodies against bone-specific ALP.

AB Using an intron-GUS gene as a marker, various factors influencing the T-DNA transfer from Agrobacterium into wheat and barley cells were investigated. Among the 3 strains used, a supervirulent strain, EHA101(pIG121Hm), was found to be the most efficient. Calli derived from immature embryos of several cultivars (cvs) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cvs. Florida, Jinan 177 and Yuanfeng 6) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. Igri) were cocultivated with Agrobacterium, and their susceptibilities to agrobacteria infection differed greatly. Depending on their type and age, calli cultured on solid medium showed a high degree of variation in their competency for T-DNA transfer. However, efficient and highly reproducible GUS expression was observed in calli of wheat cv. Florida cultured in liquid medium. Acetosyringone (AS) was found to be vital for this process. The frequency of T-DNA transfer as measured by GUS expression was greatly increased by longer and repeated co-cultivation.

AB Seventeen lines of the wheat cultivar 'Saratovskaya 29' isogenic for dominant genes marking various wheat chromosomes have been developed. The objective of the development was to introduce these genes into the corresponding monosomic lines of the cultivar. The lines are isogenic for such marker characters as hairy glume, black glume colour, elongated glume, club spike shape, pubescent auricles, red auricles, non-waxiness, purple culm, reduced height, purple pericarp. We expect to introduce some of them into the corresponding monosomic lines soon. The genes for hairy glume (Hg), black glume colour (Bg), elongated glume (Egl), non-waxiness (Wxl(1)), club spike shape (C), pubescent auricles (Pa) have been introduced into the corresponding monosomic lines of 'Saratovskaya 29'. The genes for purple pericarp, Pp1, Pp2, Pp3 and for elongated glume, Egl(P), are located on chromosomes 7B, 6A, 2A and 7AL, respectively.
   The introduction of other marker genes is currently at various stages of progress.

AB Hexaploid wheat lines (Triticum aestivum L.) obtained with the participation of Aegilops umbellulata as a donor of genes for resistance to brown leaf rust were investigated. The wheat lines were phytopathologically differentiated as resistant and susceptible to the disease mentioned. Protein components and subunits of three groups of storage proteins were analyzed in search of biochemical markers for resistance. The banding patterns were obtained by vertical block polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the gliadin and glutenin patterns were established differences which indicate that rearrangement between homoeologous loci on 1AS+1DS chromosomes of wheat and the 1U chromosome of Ae.umbellulata had occured in the resistant line R 12. These alterations in the pattern of R 12 wheat line compared to the susceptible S 15 line could be examined as biochemical markers of 1U chromosome from Ae.umbellulata.

AB To study genetic variation in crossability, 80 barley accessions of diverse geographic origin consisting of 50 wild barleys (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum or ssp. agriocrithon) and 30 cultivated barleys (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare) were crossed as the male parent with a highly crossable wheat variety, Shinchunaga. Crossabilities, expressed as the percentage of pollinated florets giving embryo-containing caryopses, ranged from 0% to 68.6%. Barley accessions from East Asia had generally a low crossability, while barley accessions from other regions exhibited a wider range of crossability including highly crossable genotypes. No significant difference in mean crossability was found between wild and cultivated barleys. To estimate the number and location of barley genes controlling the crossability, doubled haploid lines derived from the cross between the barley varieties Steptoe and Morex were crossed as the male parent with wheat. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using molecular markers identified four QTL. These were mapped to the centromeric regions of chromosomes 2H, 3H and 5H and the short arm of chromosome 7H. The QTL on chromosomes 3H and 5H had larger effects than those on chromosomes 2H and 7H. The four QTL collectively explained 35.4% of the total variance under a multiple QTL model. Relationships of the QTL identified in the present study with previously reported crossability genes of barley and wheat are discussed.

AB Resistance to T. yallundae and T. acuformis was studied in addition lines of D. villosum chromosomes to Chinese Spring wheat and in five D. villosum accessions. In order to investigate the resistance of D. villosum chromosomes to the two eyespot pathogens, inoculated seedlings were scored by visual estimates of disease severity 10 weeks after inoculation. In addition, DNA was isolated from these plants and the fungal DNAs of both species were quantified by competitive PCR. Visual assessment showed D. villosum to be resistant (to both T. yallundae and ir: acuformis) compared to Chinese Spring. The level of pathogen DNA was also generally lower in D. villosum accessions than in Chinese Spring. The resistance to T. yallundae was determined by factor(s) on chromosomes 1V, 2V, 3V(?) and 4V. In contrast resistance to I acuformis was not found on 4V but on chromosome 1V, 2V, 3V(?) and to a lesser extent 5V. This work indicates that in D. villosum the genetic basis of resistance to the two pathogens differs.

AB European oat germ plasm involving 252 varieties, landraces, and breeding lines has been characterised by allelic constitution at three independent complex avenin loci. A total of 26 avenin alleles (blocks), including 7 at the Ave1 (Avn A), 10 at the Ave2 (Avn B), and 9 at the Ave3 (Avn C) loci were revealed. The avenin block variants were shown to be coded by gene clusters of 2-5 single expressed genes. A catalogue of the identified avenin blocks as well as a list of the avenin phenotypes is presented. It has been discovered that about 8% of the oat varieties were heterogeneous comprising two or three different avenin profiles. The varieties assayed have been classified into 79 avenin phenotypes made up by the different alleles. Forty-six of these phenotypes were distinguished uniquely, while the other 33 were shared by groups possessing from 2 to 41 genotypes each. Members within these groups had certain ancestors in common. Non-random patterns of both the avenin allele and phenotype distributions have been found.

AB Chromosome 5A of wheat carries several major genes of agronomic importance, including Vrn1 controlling spring/winter wheat difference, Q determining spike morphology and B1 inhibiting awn development. A population of single-chromosome recombinant lines from the cross between two chromosome substitution Lines, echinus Spring' (Cappelle-Desprez 5A) and 'Chinese Spring' (Triticum spelta 5A) was developed to map these genes on the long arm of chromosome 5A relative to RFLP markers. Using 120 recombinant lines, a map of approximately 230 cM in length was constructed. The gene order was centromere-Vrn1-Q-B1. The Vrn1 locus was tightly linked to two RFLP markers, Xbcd450 and Xrz395 with 0.8 cM, and to Xpsr426 with 5.0 cM. The Vrn1-adjacent region was located in the central of the long arm, approximately 90 cM from the centromere. The chromosome region around Q and the 5A/4A translocation break-point were mapped by three RFLP markers, and their order was found to be Q-Xpsr370-Xcdo457-4A/5A break-point-Xpsr164. The B1 locus was located on the most distal portion of the long arm.

AB Winter wheats with high grain quality for bread making are produced in southern Ukraine. Wheat breeding began more then 80 years ago. Over this time, seven wheat variety changes were made and yield potential increased from 2.73 t ha(-1) to 6.74 t ha(-1). This increase was due to a decrease in photoperiodic sensitivity and the introduction of semidwarf genes. Genes for photoperiodic sensitivity (Ppd) and vernalisation requirement (Vrn) were combined, and the effect of these genes on grain yield, frost and drought resistance, and growth and development rate of plants in autumn and early spring were studied. Breeding was carried out, utilising traditional and non-traditional methods such as anther culture, biochemical and molecular markers, and screening in artificial environments using phytotrons. This approach resulted in the release of several winter wheat varieties with high yield potentials and well expressed adaptation features by the Plant Breeding and Genetics Institute (Odessa).

AB The 1990s have seen an acceleration in the development of new biotechnologies which can increase the efficiency of wheat breeding by providing new and novel sources of variation, speeding up the breeding cycle, and increasing the efficiency of selection. This paper reviews the most significant technologies and their probable impact on wheat breeding into the next millennium. Amongst techniques developed from the application of tissue culture methods, doubled haploid systems are at last making a contribution through the development of the maize pollination system. By the introduction of various improvements, this is now efficient enough to produce material from a range of adapted genotypes in large numbers, and varieties are entering national list trials from this system. Developments in tissue culture have also led to the realistic possibility of genetically engineering wheat, based on biolistic methods of gene delivery into immature embryos. Some problems relating to gene stability and expression remain to be resolved, but targets, particularly with respect to disease and pest resistance and end-use quality, are now being actively pursued. The development of the genetic wheat map using molecular marker systems has revolutionalised the power of genetical analysis in wheat, enabling agronomic trait loci, whether major genes or QTL, to be identified,located and 'tagged'. Additionally, strategies for the molecular cloning of loci are being developed, particularly by exploiting a comparative mapping approach which combines the genetical information from all cereals in a common framework. This will lead to tools for modifying crop phenotype in a directed fashion to produce improved and novel phenotypes.

AB A method for efficient genetic transformation of wheat has been developed using immature embryos as targets for microprojectile-mediated gene transfer and a helium driven particle delivery system. Screening and selection of transgenic cells, somatic embryos and regenerated plants are performed with the gus-gene and the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (bar) gene coding for Basta-resistance as the selectable marker. On average, one fertile transgenic plant can be obtained from about 100 microprojectile treated, immature embryos. The number of integrated copies of the transferred gene ranges from 1 up to about 10. Stable integrated genes are inherited in most of the transgenic lines in a normal mendelian fashion segregating 3:1 in the F-2. Homozygous, as well as heterozygous,lines have been followed and analysed genetically at the molecular level and up to F-5. Apart from normal stable gene expression, examples have also been found which showed a loss of gene activity or unexpected segregation pattern. For applied aspects, different genes are transferred aiming for improved disease resistance, modification of quality, or other characteristics. First results from these transgenic lines are reported, and problems still existing with the production of stable transgenic wheat lines are discussed.

AB Characterisation of introgressions of powdery mildew resistance into wheat from Aegilops speltoides and Ae. mutica was attempted by the application of cytological analysis of meiotic behaviour and molecular markers, based on isozymes and RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA). Cytological results suggest that a chromosome segment of Ae. speltoides has been successfully translocated to a wheat chromosome, while transfers from Ae. mutica appear to consist of whole chromosome substitutions. RAPD analysis detected eight bands in the line Sp1, and six bands in the line Mt1, which may be potential markers for powdery mildew (PM) resistance. In all Mt progenies the Ep-T1 product segregated, suggesting that the resistance gene is associated with the group 7 homoeologue in Ae. mutica.

AB Genetic diversity for micronutrient efficiency among the most highly adapted and advanced hexaploid and tetraploid wheat cultivars in the world is limited compared with alien species of wheat or rye. Therefore, screening for zinc efficiency was conducted in greenhouse experiments under controlled conditions, and in field trials. Different varieties of hexaploid wheat, hexaploid oats and diploid rye, together with hexaploid and octoploid triticales, wheat-Agropyron, wheat-Aegilops and several wheat-alien chromosome addition series were studied. Considerable differences in zinc efficiency were found between wheat and its relatives. Individual chromosomes of Secale, Agropyron and Haynaldia were found to carry major genes for this character. The transfer of alien chromosome segments was effective, demonstrated using several wheat-rye translocation lines. Alien genetic information was clearly expressed in the wheat genetic background. Further experimental introgressions by chromosome manipulation and marker-aided selection may efficiently contribute to wheat improvement in marginal soils.

Agrobacterium T-DNA vectors containing the C1/Lc anthocyanin-biosynthesis regulatory genes, the gusA gene or a synthetic green fluorescent protein gene (sgfp-S65T) were constructed from original binary vectors. The visual T-DNA markers were used as cell-autonomous reporters of early Agrobacterium-mediated transformation events in the wheat and barley cells. This localization of the transformed cells revealed a non-random distribution throughout each embryo and callus piece.

AB A 2275-marker genetic map of rice (Oryza sativa L.) covering 1521.6 cM in the Kosambi function has been constructed using 186 F-2 plants from a single cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare and the indica variety Kasalath. The map provides the most detailed and informative genetic map of any plant. Centromere locations on 12 linkage groups were determined by dosage analysis of secondary and telotrisomics using >130 DNA markers located on respective chromosome arms. A limited influence on meiotic recombination inhibition by the centromere in the genetic map was discussed. The main sources of the markers in this map were expressed sequence tag (EST) clones from Nipponbare callus, root, and shoot libraries. We mapped 1455 loci using ESTs; 615 of these loci showed significant similarities to known, genes, including single-copy genes, family genes, and isozyme genes. The high-resolution genetic map permitted us to characterize meiotic recombinations in the whole genome. Positive interference of meiotic recombination was detected both by the distribution of recombination number per each chromosome and by the distribution of double crossover interval lengths.

AB A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure was adopted to physically map two RFLP markers, umc22 and umcl22, which are in linkage group 2 in the maize genetic map. The gene ht1 (Helminthosporium turcium resistance 1) is linked closely to umc22 with 4.3 cM on one side and umcl22 with 1.2 cM on the other side. In this study, the FISH results showed the two tested markers were located on both 2L (the long arm of chromosome2) and 7L. The percentage distance from the centromere to the hybridization site was 61.8 for umc22 and 63.0 for umcl22 on 2L, and 47.5 and 48.9 on 7L respectively. It demonstrated that both umc22 and umcl22 had their homologous or homoeologous sequences on 7L besides 2L and they were duplicated sequences. Because genetic and physical maps show the same marker order, the gene ht1 should be physically located between the hybridization sites of umc22 and umcl22 on 2L and probably also should have its homologous or homoeologous sequence between the two hybridization sites on 7L. Actually, the signal spots showing the hybridization sites of the markers umcl22 and umc22 probably also represent the physical location of the ht1, because each signal spot could occupy about 7% of the arm, while the percentage distance between uncl22 and umc22 is only 1.2. The FISH techniques of small low copy DNA sequences for plants are discussed.

AB Identifying genotypes carrying the dwarfing genes Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 would be of great interest for wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) breeding. Two RFLP loci were found to be linked to those two genes, Xpsr 144-4B with Rhr-B1 on chromosome 4BS and Xglk578-4D with Rht-D1 on chromosome 4DS, by genotyping two F-2 populations, Renan (Rht-B1b) x Camp-Remy and Rendez-Vous (Rht-D1b) x Roazon. Utilisation of these markers in breeding schemes is discussed.

AB A strong association between the absence of the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) protein for the 4A chromosome of wheat and Japanese Udon noodle quality has been previously described. The aim of this study was to identify a molecular marker linked to the GBSS 4A locus which could be used to identify wheat with the desired texture for Udon noodles. PCR primers were designed to target this gene which gave a 440 bp PCR band, corresponding to the presence or absence of the 4A GBSS gene. Of the 268 genotypes screened with these primers, 267 were correctly identified using the PCR primers. The remaining genotype was shown to be heterogeneous for the marker. The PCR marker test developed has advantages over existing methods used to screen for Udon noodle starch quality as it enables high throughput, accurate tests to be carried out on leaves of young seedlings or mature seed and identify breeding lines that are heterogeneous for the 4A allele which will allow for reselections. Application of this PCR test will speed up selection for Udon noodle quality genotypes and reduce breeding costs for production of noodle wheat varieties.

AB Variation in high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunit composition among wild and cultivated einkorn wheats (2n = 2x = 14, AA) was investigated using one-(SDS-PAGE and urea/SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional (IEF x SDS-PAGE) electrophoretic analyses. The material comprised 150 accessions of Triticum urartu, 160 accessions of T. boeoticum, 24 accessions of T. boeoticum subsp. thaoudar and 74 accessions of primitive domesticated T. monococcum from many different germplasm collections. The biochemical characteristics of HMW-glutenin subunits of T. boeoticum and T. monococcum were highly similar to one another but distinctly different from those of T. urartu. All the species analysed were characterised by large intraspecific variation and only three HMW-glutenin subunit patterns were identical between T. boeoticum and T. monococcum. Consistent with the distinct nature of T. urartu, all its HMW-glutenin patterns were different from those found in T. boeoticum and T. monococcum. The differences detected between these species might reflect their reproductive isolation and are consistent with recent nomenclatural and biosystematic treatments that recognise T. ta al tu as separate species from T. boeoticum and T. monococcum. The presence of three distinct glutenin components in some accessions of the species studied seems to be evidence for the existence of at least three active genes controlling the synthesis of the HMW-glutenin subunits in the A genome of wild and primitive domesticated diploid wheats. Results indicate also that HMW-glutenin subunits could represent useful markers for the evaluation of genetic variability present in different wild diploid wheat collections and subsequently for their conservation and future utilisation.

AB An RFLP-based map consisting of 160 loci was constructed in an intervarietal cross of foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.], Longgu 25 x Pagoda Flower Green. The map comprises nine linkage groups, which were aligned with the nine foxtail millet chromosomes using trisomic lines, and spans 964 cM. The intraspecific map was compared to an interspecific map, constructed in a S. italica x S. viridis cross. Both the order of the markers and the genetic distances between the loci were highly conserved. Deviations from the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian segregation ratios were observed in both the intra- and inter-specific populations. The segregation data indicate that chromosome VIII in the Longgu 25 x Pagoda Flower Green cross carries a gene that strongly affects gamete fertility.

AB A comparative genetic map of Aegilops umbellulata with wheat was constructed using RFLP probes that detect homoeoloci previously mapped in hexaploid bread wheat. All seven Ae. umbellulata chromosomes display one or more rearrangements relative to wheat. These structural changes are consistent with the sub-terminal morphology of chromosomes 2 U, 3 U, 6 U and 7 U. Comparison of the chromosomal locations assigned by mapping and those obtained by hybridization to wheat/Ae. umbellulata single chromosome addition lines verified the composition of the added Ae. umbellulata chromosomes and indicated that no further cytological rearrangements had taken place during the production of the alien-wheat aneuploid lines. Relationships between Ae. umbellulata and wheat chromosomes were confirmed, based on homoeology of the centromeric regions, for 1 U, 2 U, 3 U, 5 U and 7 U. However, homoeology of the centromeric regions of 4 U with wheat group-6 chromosomes and of 6 U with wheat group-4 chromosomes was also confirmed, suggesting that a re-naming of these chromosomes map be pertinent. The consequences of the rearrangements of the Ae. umbellulata genome relative to wheat for gene introgression are discussed.

AB DNA sequences encoding type-I thionins were isolated from Triticum aestivum L. cv 'Chinese Spring' using PCR with consensus primers. Blunt-end cloning. sequencing and PCR-based chromosome assignment of these fragments uncovered the three orthologous sequences corresponding to the single-copy genes at the Pur-1 loci on each of the group-1 chromosomes. Comparison with two previously published cDNA sequences revealed the presence of two introns that contain most of the polymorphic nucleotide sites. The observed orthologous DNA sequence variation among Pur-1 loci, encoded by each of the A, B and D genomes, enabled us to establish interlocus relationships and to construct locus-specific primer sets. Analogously, the Pur-R1 sequence from rye was isolated. and a locus-specific primer pair was constructed as well. Hence. four locus-specific primer sets are now available as molecular markers for the homoeologous 1AL, 1BL, 1DL and 1RL chromosome arms. Amplification from several diploid and tetraploid wheat species showed that the primers can be used as molecular tools for studying wheat phylogeny.

AB Efficiency of Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer was improved in rice by microprojectile pretreatment. Fertile transgenic plants were easily recovered using this protocol. Since an osmotic treatment is part of the bombardment protocol, we studied the effect of plasmolysis alone (i.e. without any microprojectiles) on transient expression of the gus gene transferred by Agrobacterium to precultured rice embryos. We report here for the first time that plasmolysis alone as a single pretreatment, yielded an even higher number of cells expressing the marker gene than the combination of microprojectile bombardment and osmotic treatment. This indicates that the effect of the osmoticum on gene transfer is independent from bombardment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Near-isogenic lines of alloplasmic wheat for the Rf3 gene controlling fertility restoration against the cytoplasm of Triticum timopheevi were developed by successive backcrossing of Chinese Spring to the F-1 plants between (timopheevi)-CS (male sterile) and T. spelta (carrying Rf3). The resultant three BC3F1 plants were self-pollinated so as to obtain 125 BC3F2 progenies. Using this population, we precisely mapped the Rf3 gene on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1B (1BS) of the RFLP linkage map. The Rf3 gene was localized at a position 1.2 cM and 2.6 cM distant from Xcdo388 and Xabc156, respectively. The genetic distances of Rf3 from Nor and Gli-BI were calculated to be 22.3 cM and 18.6 cM, respectively, supporting previous data. Estimation of the physical distance of the region suggets that the Rf3 gene resides within 500 kbp from the adjacent RFLP markers. The marker order of the genetic map corresponded to that of the cytological map, except for the position of Xbcd98. Comparison between genetic and cytological maps clearly shows that RFLP markers are unevenly distributed throughout the chromosome arm, and recombinations took place unequally in the chromosome arm.

AB Percent hull is an important physical parameter of oat grain quality, but it is affected by environment. Multiple time-consuming evaluations are required to obtain a correct determination of phenotype. The application of marker-assisted selection for the genes involved would greatly simplify the identification of desirable oat genotypes. Bulked segregant analysis, with selected progeny lines derived from a cross between Cascade and AC Marie (30 and 23% hull, respectively), was used to identify randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers linked to genetic factors controlling primary kernel hull percentage in oat. Twelve polymorphisms, identified between bulks, were tested for linkage to genetic factors controlling hull percentage by genotyping 80 randomly selected F-2-derived F-8 lines from the progeny population. Three markers showed significant test statistics for quantitative trait locus effects, when tested with primary kernel percent hull data from two environments. Together, the unlinked marker loci OPC13(800), OPD20(600), and OPK7(1300) explained approximately 41% of the genetic variance in primary kernel percent hull, after accounting for the main effect of environment.

Variations in flowering period, number of flowers per plant, and flower morphology were observed in Saintpaulia ionantha L. plants directly regenerated from leaf disk explants. The cytokinins, benzylaminopurine and zeatin, tested in the culture medium did not affect the basic plant characteristics including flower colour which remained stable in both species. Micropropagation of selected somaclones having the desirable trait of high number of flowers per plant was stable in the MV2 and MV3 generations.

The results indicate that the agronomic performance was altered by tissue culture regeneration and the frequency of variation was cultivar dependent. Seven TCD lines showing desirable agronomic characters were selected in the SC6 progeny. Molecular markers (protein, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)) have used applied to determine the variability induced by tissue culture. Polymorphism was detected in sequences coding for C-hordeins in line 70 derived from cv. 'Jubiley'. Two lines from cv. 'Ruen' exhibited polymorphic bands after hybridization with a mitochondrial DNA probe. RAPD assays have been carried out using 20 different 10-mer primers. Heritable polymorphisms in several TCD lines have been observed.

AB This article reviews present or potential practices of rumen manipulation to increase the nutritional value of ruminant feeds, particularly relevant in tropical animal production. Modification of rumen microbial composition and microbial activities can be achieved by means of additives that selectively affect rumen symbionts, by introducing foreign microbes into the rumen, or potentially, by genetically manipulating rumen microorganisms. Rumen defaunation has been shown to increase the protein outflow to the intestine and a number of tropical plants have been shown to have strong defaunating activity. They could be useful both as protein supplements and as natural defaunating agents. Microorganisms from systems other than the rumen, such as digestive bacteria from wild herbivores and nitrogen-fixing bacteria from legume roots or fungi, may well represent a source of enzymes to increase degradation of recalcitrant components or detoxification of the diet. Molecular techniques have great potential for achieving the goals of rumen manipulation. They could allow the introduction of new or enhanced, fermentation activities. Considerable research is being done to transfer and express foreign genes in rumen bacteria. Suitable markers other than antibiotic resistance for tracking the genetically manipulated bacteria in the rumen and cloning vectors from rumen bacteria, are being sought. In practical terms, the potential of molecular techniques to improve rumen fermentation is enormous, in spite of the limitations imposed by the complexity of the rumen ecosystem.

AB Wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr43 was recently transferred from Aegilops tauschii Coss. to common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to produce hard red winter wheat germplasm line KS92WGRC16. Monosomic and telocentric analyses were used to determine the chromosomal and chromosome arm location of Lr43. KS92WGRC16 was crossed with each of the seven D-genome monosomic lines. The F-2 families were inoculated with race PBJL of the leaf rust fungus, Puccinia recondita Roberge ex Desmaz. f. sp. tritici (Eriks. & E. Henn.) D.M. Henderson. The number of resistant to susceptible seedlings did not deviate significantly from a 3:1 ratio in crosses involving 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, or 6D monosomic lines. However, the 7D monosomic-derived F-2 deviated significantly from a 3:1 ratio (chi(2) = 32.5 P < 0.001) indicating that Lr43 is located on this Chromosome. Twenty resistant F-2 plants from the critical cross were progeny tested, and results confirmed the location of Lr43 on chromosome 7D. Telocentric analysis showed that Lr43 is on the short arm of chromosome 7D (7DS) and it is unlinked to the centromere. This information may facilitate development of molecular markers and result in more efficient breeding for resistant cultivars.

SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANT-VIRUSES; GENE; DISEASE
AB High plains virus (HPV) has the potential to cause significant damage in susceptible maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes. The virus is vectored by the wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella, Keifer, which also vectors wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). We have previously characterized susceptibility of maize inbred lines to double infection of HPV slid WSMV. The objective of this study was to characterize the inheritance of resistance to systemic spread of HPV and WSMV in mixed infection. Genetic analysis was done with crosses B73 (resistant) x Wf9 (susceptible) and B73 x W64A (susceptible). Parental, F-1, and F-2 plants were WCM-inoculated with HPV and WSMV, and scored for their reactions both visually and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. F-1 plants were resistant to systemic spread of HPV and WSMV, indicating that resistance is dominant in these lines. Segregation (based on symptomology) in the F-2 generation fit a 3:1 resistant:susceptible ratio in both B73 x W64A and B73 x Wf9 (P = 0.34 and 0.11, respectively), consistent with a single chromosome region segregating for resistance to both viruses. The resistant allele was contributed by B73 and was Linked to marker bnl6.29 on the short arm of chromosome six. This chromosome region has been shown to control resistance to WSMV (wsm1). Two independent sets of inbred-backcross-derived near-isogenic lines confirmed the effect of this chromosome region. This study reveals the genetic basis of symptomology observed upon mixed infection with HPV and WSMV in these populations. Identification of molecular markers linked to virus resistance genes may enhance inbred line development efforts.

AB Wheat germin is a protein expressed during germination which possesses an oxalate oxidase activity. Germin-type oxalate oxidases have been extensively studied in monocotyledons (wheat and barley) where they are thought to have important functions for development, stress response and defence against pathogens. In contrast, almost nothing is known about the germin-like proteins found in dicotyledons, gymnosperms and myxomycetes. In this work, cDNA clones for three genes (ATGER1, ATGER2 and ATGER3) encoding germin-like proteins, initially characterized as expressed sequence tags (ESTs), from Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA libraries were further characterized. In addition, we isolated and sequenced a Brassica napus cDNA which was strongly homologous to the cDNA for ATGER1. Sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs showed that they possess all the characteristic features of members of the germin family and of the germin/seed globulins/sucrose binding protein superfamily. Sequence comparisons and mapping demonstrated the existence of at least two different gene families in the A. thaliana genome encoding a minimum of three genes for germins. These three genes have been mapped in three different location on the Arabidopsis genome. By northern blot hybridizations we found that these genes are differentially regulated. ATGER1 was expressed during germination, like wheat germin, but also in leaves whereas ATGER2 transcripts were exclusively found in developing embryos, like wheat pseudo-germin. ATGER3 mRNAs were found in leaves and flowers and their abundance was shown to vary during the circadian cycle.

AB A rapid Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for wheat was developed using freshly isolated immature embryos, precultured immature embryos, and embryogenic calli as explants. The explants were inoculated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain C58 (ABI) harboring the binary vector pMON18365 containing the beta-glucuronidase gene with an intron, and a selectable marker, the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene. Various factors were found to influence the transfer-DNA delivery efficiency, such as explant tissue and surfactants present in the inoculation medium. The inoculated immature embryos or embryogenic calli were selected on G418-containing media. Transgenic plants were regenerated from all three types of explants. The total time required from inoculation to the establishment of plants in soil was 2.5 to 3 months. So far, more than 100 transgenic events have been produced. Almost all transformants were morphologically normal. Stable integration, expression, and inheritance of the transgenes were confirmed by molecular and genetic analysis. One to five copies of the transgene were integrated into the wheat genome without rearrangement. Approximately 35% of the transgenic plants received a single copy of the transgenes based on Southern analysis of 26 events. Transgenes in T-1 progeny segregated in a Mendelian fashion in most of the transgenic plants.

Rht-B1c was mapped on chromosome 4BS in the centromere region, distal and closely linked to the RFLP markers Xpsr144 (11.9 cM) and Xpsr584 (17.8 cM), but proximal to Xmwg634 (30 cM). Rht-D1c, however, was found to be closely linked to the distally located markers Xpsr921 (0.8 cM) and Xmwg634 (1.5 cM). The homoeologous relationships between the GA-insensitive dwarfing genes within the Triticeae are discussed.

AB The Afa-family repetitive sequences were isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare, 2n = 14) and cloned as pHvA14. This sequence distinguished each barley chromosome by in situ hybridization. Double color fluorescence in situ hybridization using pHvA14 and 5S rDNA or HvRT-family sequence (subtelomeric sequence of barley) allocated individual barley chromosomes showing a specific pattern. of pHvA14 to chromosome 1H to 7H. As the case of the D genome chromosomes of Aegilops squarrosa and common wheat (Triticum aestivum) hybridized by its Afa-family sequences, the signals of pHvA14 in barley chromosomes tended to appear in the distal regions that do not carry many chromosome band markers. In the telomeric regions these signals always placed in more proximal portions than those of HvRT-family. Based on the distribution patterns of Afa-family sequences in the chromosomes of barley and D genome chromosomes of wheat,we discuss a possible mechanism of amplification of the repetitive sequences during the evolution of Triticeae. In addition, we show here that HvRT-family also could be used to distinguish individual barley chromosomes from the patterns of in situ hybridization.

AB Detailed physical mapping of markers from rice chromosome 9, and from syntenous (at the genetic level) regions of other cereal genomes, has resulted in rice yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contigs spanning parts of rice 9. This physical mapping, together with comparative genetic mapping, has demonstrated that synteny has been largely maintained between the genomes of several cereals at the level of contiged YACs. Markers located in one region of rice chromosome 9 encompassed by the YAC contigs have exhibited restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using deletion lines for the Phl locus. This has allowed demarcation of the region of rice chromosome 9 syntenous with the ph1b and ph1c deletions in wheat chromosome 5B. A group of probes located in wheat homoeologous group 5 and barley chromosome 5H, however, have synteny with rice chromosomes other than 9. This suggests that the usefulness of comparative trait analysis and of the rice genome as a tool to facilitate gene isolation will differ from one region to the next, and implies that the rice genome is more ancestral in structure than those of the Triticeae.

AB The Cre3 gene confers a high level of resistance to the root endoparasitic nematode Heterodera avenae in wheat. A DNA marker cosegregating with H. avenae resistance was used as an entry point for map-based cloning of a disease resistance gene family at the Cre3 locus. Two related gene sequences have been analysed at the Cre3 locus. One, identified as a cDNA clone, encodes a polypeptide with a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and a leucine-rich region; this member of the disease resistance gene family is expressed in roots. A second Cre3 gene sequence, cloned as genomic DNA, appears to be a pseudogene, with a frame shift caused by a deletion event. These two genes, related to members of the cytoplasmic NBS - leucine rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes were physically mapped to the distal 0.06 fragment of the long arm of wheat chromosome 2D and cosegregated with nematode resistance.

AB Diagnostic markers for eight Thinopyrum distichum addition chromosomes in Triticum turgidum were established using C-banding, in situ hybridization, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The C-band karyotype conclusively identified individual Th. distichum chromosomes and distinguished them from chromosomes of T. turgidum. Also, TaqI and BamHI restriction fragments containing 5S and 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA sequences were identified as positive markers specific to Th. distichum chromosomes. Simultaneous fluorescence in situ hybridization showed both 5S and 18S-5.8S-26S ribosomal RNA genes to be located on chromosome IV. Thinopyrum distichum chromosome VII carried only a 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA locus and chromosome pair II carried only a 5S rRNA locus. The arrangement of these loci on Th. distichum chromosome IV was different from that on wheat chromosome pair 1B. Two other unidentified Th. distichum chromosome pairs also carried 5S rRNA loci.

AB Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance in soft red winter wheat (SRWW) cultivars has been achieved by substituting a group 7 chromosome from Thinopyrum intermedium for chromosome 7D. To localize BYDV resistance, a detailed molecular genetic analysis was done on the alien group 7 Th. intermedium chromosome to determine its structural organization. Triticeae group 7 RFLP markers and rye specific repetitive sequences used in the analysis showed that the alien chromosome in the P29 substitution line has distinguishing features. The 350-480 bp rye telomeric sequence family was present on the long arm as determined by Southern and fluorescence in situ hybridization. However, further analysis using a rye dispersed repetitive sequence indicated that this alien chromosome does not contain introgressed segments from the rye genome. The alien chromosome is homoeologous to wheat chromosomes 7A and 7D as determined by RFLP analysis. Presence of the waxy gene on chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D but its absence on the alien chromosome in P29 suggests some internal structural differences on the short arm between Th. intermedium and wheat group 7 chromosomes. The identification of rye telomeric sequences on the alien Thinopyrum chromosome and the homoeology to wheat chromosomes 7A and 7D provide the necessary information and tools to analyze smaller segments of the Thinopyrum chromosome and to localize BYDV resistance in SRWW cultivars.

AB Eyespot is an important disease of wheat in the United States Pacific Northwest. Genes Pch1, located on chromosome 7D, and Pch2, located on chromosome 7A, are the only known sources of eyespot resistance in hexaploid wheat. A core collection of Triticum monococcum, a close relative of the A-genome donor of bread wheat, consisting of 118 accessions from 26 countries was screened for resistance using a beta-glucuronidase-transformed strain of the pathogen. Fifty-two (44%) accessions from 15 different countries were resistant. More than half of the accessions collected in Turkey (26 of 42) were resistant. Two accessions were more resistant than resistant cultivars Cappelle Desprez (Pch2) and Madsen (Pch1). Screening these accessions for the isozyme marker Ep-A1b, which is linked with Pch2 in hexaploid wheat, revealed variation but no association with resistance. These results indicate T. monococcum is a new source of resistance to Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides that potentially contains more effective resistance to P. herpotrichoides than that conferred by either Pch1 or Pch2.

AB A PCR-based marker (E20(570)) linked to the gene Gm4t, which confers resistance to a dipteran pest gall midge (Osseolia oryzae), has been mapped using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique in rice. Gm4t is a dominant resistance gene. We initially failed to detect useful polymorphism for this marker in a F-3 mapping population derived from a cross between two indica parents, 'Abhaya' x 'Shyamala', with as many as 35 restriction enzymes. 'Abhaya' carries the resistance gene Gm4t and 'Shyamala' is susceptible to gall midge. Subsequently, E20(570) was mapped using another mapping population represented by a F-2 progeny from a cross between 'Nipponbare', a japonica variety, and 'Kasalath', an indica variety, in which the gene Gm4t was not known to be present. Gm(4)t mapped onto chromosome 8 between markers R1813 and S1633B. Our method, thus, presents an alternative way of mapping genes which otherwise would be difficult to map because of a lack of polymorphism between closely related parents differing in desired agronomic traits.

AB The quantitative level of friabilin 15-kDa protein present on the surface of water-washed starch is highly correlated with wheat grain softness. Friabilin is composed primarily, if not exclusively, of the proteins puroindoline a and b. The transcript levels of these two proteins are similar among hard and soft wheat varieties, and the expression of both is controlled by the short arm of chromosome 5D, also the chromosomal location of the Hardness gene. We report here a glycine to serine sequence change in puroindoline b associated with hard grain texture. This amino acid change results from a single nucleotide mutation and resides in a region thought to be important for the lipid-binding properties of puroindolines. No recombination was observed between the serine puroindoline-b mutation, hard grain texture and low levels of starch surface friabilin among a set of 83 homozygous 5D recombinant lines derived from the soft-textured variety 'Chinese Spring' and the substitution line 'Chinese Spring' containing the 5D chromosome of the hard-textured variety 'Cheyenne'. The sequence change reported here may adversely affect the lipid-binding properties of puroindoline-b and so effect hard grain texture. The results suggest that grain hardness results from puroindoline-b functionality such that the Hardness gene is a direct manifestation of puroindoline structure. We are suggesting the tentative molecular marker loci designations of Pinb-D1a and Pinb-D1b for the glycine and serine puroindoline-b types, respectively.

AB We used a pattern of 30 lectins and antibodies against antigens of the ABO-blood group system to find specific and sensitive markers for the basal cells of the human respiratory surface epithelium. Three lectins always stained the basal cells: Aaptos papillata agglutinin I (APA I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA): Other lectins and the antibodies gave positive results only in tissue of secretors (blood group antigens in secretions) and these were dependent on the ABO-blood group. Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin (GSA I B4) bound to basal cells of humans with blood group B and AB, Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Soy bean agglutinin (SBA), and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) bound to blood group A and AB, Lens tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA) bound to secretors in every case, and strongly to blood group O. The antibodies bound to basal cells only in the tissue of secretors, dependent on the ABO-blood group.
   The results show that lectins and antibodies may be used as markers for the detection of basal cells in the human respiratory epithelium. Furthermore they suggest that the glycosylation of some glycocomponents of the basal cells is under the control of the genes of the secretor- and ABO-blood group system. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Two families of Helianthus lines, T- (low desiccation rate) and T+ (low desiccation rate), with contrasting osmotic adjustment (OA), obtained from a divergent selection programme, were compared for several morphological traits, ecophysiological parameters and molecular markers. The physiological analysis in a glasshouse experiment showed that the two families were identical in irrigated conditions except for a single trait, relative water loss (RWL: water loss rate of excised leaves). RWL could be used for these genotypes as a physiological marker of OA. A molecular analysis of the two contrasting lines, using differential screening of cDNA libraries, led to the isolation of three specific cDNAs, one of which, DRS26, showed high sequence homology with a mammalian amino-acid transporter. Subsequent RFLP and STS studies, using DRS26 and RAPD bulked analysis, enabled the identification of putative molecular markers of RWL and OA in T-:T+ sunflower.

AB Plants accumulate abscisic acid (ABA) under droughted conditions. Genetic variation in the accumulation of ABA in detached and partially dehydrated leaves of rice has previously been reported, and this was found to be associated with variation in leaf size (smaller leaves made more ABA). Correlation analysis failed to distinguish clearly between a causal relationship between the two traits and close genetic linkage between loci controlling the traits. Here we present a detailed genetic analysis of ABA accumulation in detached and partially dehydrated rice leaves, using a population of F-2 plants generated from the lowland x upland cross IR20 (high-ABA) x 63-83 (low-ABA) which was mapped with RFLP and AFLP markers. Several highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ABA accumulation and leaf weight were identified. Only one of the minor QTLs for ABA accumulation (accounting for only 4% of the phenotypic variance) was coincident with any QTLs for leaf size such that the high-ABA allele was associated with smaller leaves. This analysis, therefore, showed that the association previously found between ABA accumulation and leaf size was probably largely due to genetic linkage and not to a direct effect of leaf size on ABA accumulation or vice versa. Because of the importance of ABA accumulation in regulating responses of plants to drought stress and the effects of plant size on the rate of development of stress, QTLs for drought-induced ABA accumulation, leaf size and tiller number were compared between rice and wheat. In particular, a possible location in rice was sought for a homoeologue of the major wheat vernalization responsive gene, Vrn1, as this gene is also associated with major effects on leaf size, tiller number and ABA accumulation in wheat. The likelihood of homoeologous loci regulating ABA accumulation, leaf size and tiller number in the two crops is discussed.

AB Analysis of genes controlling flowering time (heading date) contributes to our understanding of fundamental principles of plant development and is of practical importance because of the effects of flowering time on plant adaptation and crop yield. This review discusses the extent to which plants may share common genetic mechanisms for the control of flowering time and the implications of such conservation for gene isolation from the major cereal crops. Gene isolation may exploit the small genome of rice in map-based approaches, utilizing the conservation of gene order that is revealed when common DNA markers are mapped in different species. Alternatively, mechanisms may be conserved within plants as a whole, in which case genes cloned from the model dicot Ambidopsis thaliana provide an alternative route.

AB A study of genotype-by-salinity interaction was carried out to compare the behavior of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in two F-2 populations derived from crosses between the cherry tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. cerasiforme, and two wild relatives Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium (Jusl.) Mill. and Lycopersicon chesmannii f. minor (Hook. f.) Mull., grown at two environmental conditions (optimum and high salinity). QTLs for earliness and fruit yield could be classified into four groups: ''response-sensitive'', those detected only under control conditions or whose contribution significantly decreased in salinity; ''response-tolerant'', detected only in salinity or in which the direction of their additive effects changed; ''constitutive'', detected in both growing conditions; and ''altered'' QTLs, those where the degree of dominance changed according to the presence or absence of salt. Epistatic interactions were also influenced by the salt treatment. This differential allele effect at some (non-constitutive) QTLs induced by salt stress will make selection under an ''optimum environment'' unfruitful for the ''response-tolerant'' QTLs. Similarly, selection under salinity will ignore ''response-sensitive'' QTLs. Given that salinity is highly variable in the field, marker-assisted selection should take into account not only the ''response-tolerant'' but also the ''response-sensitive'' QTLs although there might be cases where selection in some QTLs for both conditions is not feasible. Comparing both populations, very few QTLs showed the same behavior.

AB Precise knowledge of seed quality after harvest and during storage is of particular importance for seed producers. We analysed different sunflower seed lots (Helianthus annuus L.) characterized by extremes of germination ability. We used RNA analysis to study possible changes in gene expression in seeds unable to germinate. Total RNA content was very small in dry seeds showing a low germination ability. Capacity for total RNA synthesis at the onset of imbibition was also reduced in these seeds. In addition, correlations were found between these parameters and germination ability at 19 degrees C. We demonstrated a high correlation between the amount of total RNA in the dry seed, the capacity of RNA synthesis at the onset of imbibition and the seed moisture content at the time of the harvest. The ability of dry seed mRNAs to be translated in vitro was also reduced and seven polypeptides, from stored mRNAs, were characteristic of the cotyledons from high germinability seeds. Germination can thus be affected at several levels including membrane, enzymatic and nucleic acid deteriorations. (C) 1997 Annals of Botany Company.

Protein profile differences were examined in embryogenic (E-callus) and non-embryogenic (NE-callus) wheat callus, 105 or 271 d: after callus initiation. Callus was maintained on medium containing either 5.6 or 9 mu mol/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Proteins unique to E-callus (E-proteins) were identified by computer assisted analysis of scanned images of fluorographs of in vivo-labeled proteins of E-and NE-callus. Thirty-three E-proteins were identified in 105-day-old E-callus growing on 5.6 mu mol/L 2,4-D, 71 E-proteins in 105-day-old callus on 9 mu mol/L 2,4-D, 43 E-proteins in 271-day-old callus on 5.6 mu mol/L 2,4-D, and 39 E-proteins in 271-day-old callus growing on 9 mu mol/L 2,4-D. Of these E-proteins, 10 were in 105-day-old callus regardless of 2,4-D concentration. One E-protein was present in 271-day-old callus from both 2,4-D concentrations. Two E-proteins with relative molecular masses/pIs of 43.0/7.6 and 27.0/8.2 were present in E-callus from three of the four treatments. These proteins could be used as markers for determining if tissue has embryogenic potential.

AB Co-segregation of male fertility with DNA markers selected by targeted mapping approaches as being potentially linked to the Rfp1 restorer gene for the pol cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) was analyzed using two canola (Brassica napus L.) backcross populations. Eleven DNA markers (10 RFLP markers and one RAPD marker) directly linked to the Rfp1 locus were identified. The linkage group containing the Rfp1 locus was found to correspond to B. napus linkage group 18 of Landry et al. (1991). A similar pattern of co-segregation between DNA markers and male fertility was observed in a backcross population segregating for the pol restorer gene Rfp2 from line 'UM2383'; one RFLP marker, cRF1b, showed perfect linkage with both Rfp1 and Rfp2 and detected identical polymorphic fragments in both the Rfp1 and Rfp2 restorer lines. Our findings indicate that restoration of pol CMS is controlled by a single nuclear genetic locus on linkage group 18 and that Rfp1 and Rfp2 are likely allelic.

AB Following the induction of allosyndetic pairing between the Thinopyrum-derived Lr19 translocation in 'Indis' wheat and homoeologous wheat chromatin, eight suspected recombinants for the Lr19 region were recovered. These selections were characterised for marker loci that were previously used to construct a physical map of the Lr19 segment. At the same time near-isogenic lines were developed for some of the selected segments and tested for seedling leaf-rust resistance in order to confirm the presence of Lr19. It appeared that three of the four white-endosperm selections do not possess Lr19 and only one, 88M22-149, is a true Lr19 recombinant. The resistance gene in the three non-Lr19 selections resides on chromosome 6B, appears to derive from 'Indis', and was selected unintentionally during backcrossing. The pedigree of 'Indis' is suspect and it is believed that the Lr19 translocation in 'Indis' is in reality the Tit. ponticum-derived (T4) segment rather than being of Th. distichum origin as was believed earlier, The white-endosperm recombinant, 88M22-149, retained the complete Lr19 resistance and was apparently re-located to chromosome arm 7BL in a double-crossover event. 88M22-149 has lost the Sdl gene and often shows strong self-elimination in translocation heterozygotes, This effect may result from additional gametocidal loci or from an altered chromosome structure following re-location of the segment, 88M22-149 in fact contains a duplicated region involving the Wsp-B1 locus. Three selections had partially white endosperms and expressed Lr19 and other Thinopyrum marker alleles. Polymorphisms for the available markers confirmed that the translocated segment in at least one of them had been shortened through recombination with chromosome arm 7DL. Further markers need to be studied in order to determine whether the translocation in the remaining two partially white recombinants had also undergone recombination with wheat, The eighth selection has yellow endosperm and appears to self-eliminate in certain translocation heterozygotes. No evidence of recombination could be found with the markers used, If the latter selections are in fact recombinants they may prove useful in attempts to unravel the complex segregation distortion mechanism.

AB Three mutant loci of rye determining absence of ligules (al), waxless plant (wa1) and waxy endosperm (Wx) characters were mapped in a single F-2 population, comprising 84 individual plants. The three loci could be clearly tagged in relation to 7 (al on chromosome 2R), 4 (wa1 on chromosome 7R) or 6 (Wx on chromosome 4R) RFLP markers. The mapping data are compared with existing data for homoeologous regions containing equivalent mutants of wheat, barley, rice and maize. It is shown that the loci analysed are highly conserved across the cereal species, including rye.

AB To elucidate the molecular basis of cold acclimation in strawberry (Fragaria x anannassa), we have begun studies to identify genes associated with low temperature (LT) acclimation. Differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from cold-acclimated strawberry plants allowed us to isolate several: cDNAs showing differential expression at LT. Northern analysis showed that the transcript level of Fcor1 (Fragaria cold-regulated) peaked after 2 days of LT exposure while that of Fcor2 peaked after 2 weeks. On the other hand, the level of Fcor3 transcript decreased within 24 hours of LT exposure and remained low during the 8 weeks acclimation period. Fcor1 and Fcor2 are expressed in all tissues while Fcor3 is specific to leaves. The Fcor1-encoded protein has a compositional bias for leucine, isoleucine, glycine, proline and serine. This protein shares homology with the proteins encoded by blt101, a LT-responsive gene from barley, and ESI3, a gene induced by salt stress in Lophopyrum. The FCOR2 protein is rich in lysine, leucine, valine, alanine and arginine, and shows no homology with any known gene products. The partial Fcor3 cDNA clone encodes a polypeptide that shows a very high identity with the spinach PSI subunit V and with the PSI PsaG polypeptide from barley. The level of Fcor1 transcript accumulation is correlated with the freezing tolerance of the strawberry cultivars used in our study. This suggests that Fcor1 may be useful as a molecular marker to select for this trait in related species of the Rosaceae family.

AB For intrachromosomal mapping of the dominant GA-sensitive dwarfing gene Rht12 and the vernalization response gene Vrn1 On chromosome 5A, an F-2 population was established using a wide (synthetic) wheat cross. In addition to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes four microsatellite markers were incorporated. Rht12 was mapped distally to four RFLP loci (Xmwg616, Xpsr164, Xwg114, Xpsr1201) and three microsatellite markers (Xgwm179, Xgwm410, Xgwm291), known to be located on the segment of chromosome 5AL which was ancestrally translocated and is homoeologous to Triticeae 4L. The map position of Rht12 suggests that it is homoeologous to the dominant GA-sensitive dwarfing gene Ddw1, present on chromosome 5RL. The vernalization response gene Vrn1 showed linkage to Xwg644, as might be expected from comparative maps.

AB Somaclonal-variation-induced multiple mutations were observed in a progeny of the S1587 plant, regenerated from type I calli of the aluminum-tolerant inbred maize line Cat-100-6. After five generations of self-pollination, 14 progeny families of the S1587 somaclone were found to show aluminum;toxicity symptoms with altered root tip morphology and reduced primary root growth. The most sensitive progeny, S1587-17, was crossed to the Cat-100-6 inbred line. The parental lines and the Fl were tested in nutrient solutions containing an aluminum activity gradient of 0-93 . 10(-6). The heterozygote behaves like the tolerant parent at aluminum activities up to 40 . 10(-6) and showed an intermediate phenotype at higher aluminum concentrations. Histological sections of aluminum-treated roots from tolerant and sensitive plants stained with hematoxylin, an aluminum marker, showed a progressive destruction of the root tip of the aluminum-sensitive genotype over time and indicated that tolerance in Cat-100-6 could be due to an aluminum exclusion mechanism. Segregation analysis of the F2 and backcross to the sensitive parent based on root morphology of plants subjected to an aluminum activity of 30 . 10(-6) showed the typical 3:1 and 1.1 tolerant:sensitive segregation ratios, respectively, indicating that tolerance in the Cat-100-6 inbred maize line is controlled by a single nuclear, semidominant gene, named Alm1.

AB Four minisatellite core sequences were used as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique: known as the directed amplification of minisatellite-region DNA (DAMD), to detect polymorphisms in three pairs of hexaploid/tetraploid wheat cultivars. In each pair, the tetraploid cultivar (genomic formula AABB) was extracted from its corresponding hexaploid (genomic formula AABBDD) parent. Reproducible profiles of the amplified products revealed characteristic bands that were present only in the hexaploid wheats but not in their extracted tetraploids. Some polymorphisms were observed among the hexaploid cultivars. Twenty-three DAMD-PCR amplified fragments were isolated and screened as molecular probes on the genomic DNA of wild wheat species, hexaploid wheat and triticale cultivars, Subsequently, 8 of the fragments were cloned and sequenced, The DAM D-PCR clones revealed various degrees of polymorphism among different wild and cultivated wheats. Two clones yielded individual-specific DNA fingerprinting patterns which could be used for species differentiation and cultivar identification. The results demonstrated the use of DAMD-PCR as a tool for the isolation of informative molecular probes for DNA fingerprinting in wheal cultivars and species.

Tcr-B1 and Tcr-B2, affecting both green spots initiation and shoot regeneration, were mapped in relation to RFLP markers in the centromere region and on the short arm of chromosome 2B, linked to the photoperiod-response gene Ppd2. A third QTL (Tcr-B3), influencing regeneration only, was closely related to the disease resistance locus Yr7/Sr9g on the long arm of chromosome 2B. The homoeologous relationships to the tissue-culture response loci Qsr, Qcg and Shd of barley are discussed. A possible influence of the earliness pel se genes of wheat and barley is suggested.

AB A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) map constructed from 99 doubled haploid lines of a cross between two spring barley varieties ('Blenheim' x 'Kym') was used to map QTL controlling hot water extract and grain nitrogen content (predicted by analysis with near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy). Eight QTL affecting predicted hot water extract were identified by a marker-regression approach. The largest effects were found on chromosomes 3HL, associated with the denso dwarfing gene which is present in 'Blenheim' and conferred poorer predicted hot water extract quality, and 4HL. Other QTL were detected on chromosomes 1HS, 1HL, 2HS, 2HL, 5HL and 6HS. Analysis of single markers by analysis of variance detected an additional effect on chromosome 1H. Eight QTL affecting predicted grain nitrogen content were identified by marker-regression, on chromosomes 1HS, 1HL, 2HL, 5HS, 6H, 7HS and 7HL. There was also evidence for an additional QTL on chromosome 5HL. The positions of the grain nitrogen content QTL on 5HS and 5HL are comparable to QTL on wheal chromosomes 5A and 5D that affect grain protein content. The denso gene had no detectable effect on grain nitrogen content.

AB An efficient transformation system for maize was established by improving transformation conditions for the particle bombardment of the scutellar tissue of immature embryos. Particle bombardment was carried out using constructs containing the pat gene as the selection marker and a PDS 1000/He gun (Biorad). Transformation parameters, such as the amount of gold particles used per bombardment, particle velocity, preculture time of the scutellum prior to bombardment and osmotic treatment of the target tissue before and after bombardment, were analysed. Fertile transgenic regenerants of the maize inbred lines H99, A188 and Pa91 and the crosses A188 x H99 and Pa91 x H99 were selected on Basta-containing medium. The transformation frequency was between 2% and 4%. A total of 29 transgenic plant lines was obtained and verified with Southern blot analysis. All of the transgenic plants were fertile and set seeds. The R1 progeny of single plants was analysed. A Mendelian segregation of the transgenes was observed for all of the transformants tested. For 1 candidate, stable inheritance and stable expression of the transgenes were followed up to the R-4 generation.

AB Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis DC. f sp. tritici Em. Marchal is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell). We report here the identification of three random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers closely linked to a gene for resistance to B. graminis in wheat. RAPD-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analysis was conducted using bulked segregant analysis of closely related lines developed from a segregating F-5 family. The F-5 family was derived from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Clark and the resistant line Zhengzhou 871124. Genetic analysis indicated that resistance of Zhengzhou 871124 to powdery mildew is conferred by the gene Pm1, After performing RAPD-PCR analysis with 1300 arbitrary 10-mer primers and agarose-gel electrophoresis, two RAPD markers, UBC320(420) and UBC638(550), were identified to be co-segregating with the disease resistance, No recombinants were observed between either of the RAPD markers and the gene for resistance to powdery mildew after analysis of 244 F-2 plants, The third RAPD marker. OPF12(650), was identified with denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and was determined to be 5.4 +/- 1.9 cM from the resistance gene. UBC320(420) and UBC638(550) were present in wheat powdery mildew differential lines carrying the gene Pm1, suggesting linkage between these markers and the Pl?tl resistance gene. Co-segregation between Pm1 and the two markers UBC320(420) and UBC638(550) was confirmed in a segregating population derived from a cross with CI14114. the wheat differential line carrying Pm1. The method of deriving closely related lines from inbred families that are segregating for a trait of interest should find wide application in the identification of DNA markers linked to important plant genes. The RAPD marker UBC638(550) was converted to a sequence tagged site (STS), RAPD markers tightly linked to target genes may facilitate selection and enable gene pyramiding for powdery mildew resistance in wheat breeding programs.

AB A new Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) resistance gene from Aegilops ventricosa and its transfer to hexaploid wheat is described. The 4D(4M(v)) substitution line H-93-33 derived from the cross [(Triticum turgidum H-l-l x Aegilops ventricosa no. 11) x Triticum aestivum H-10-15] was highly resistant to the Spanish population tested. Resistance seemed to be inherited as a single dominant factor in the F-2 generation resulting from a cross of H-93-33 with its susceptible parent (H-10-15). Resistance in Ae. venticosa no. 10 was located on chromosome 4M(v) using M-v wheat/Ae. ventricosa addition lines. The resistance gene transferred from Ae. ventricosa no. 11 to H-93-33 (H27) is allelic with respect to that of Ae. ventricosa no. 10 and is non-allelic with respect to the genes H3 and H6 from Monon and Caldwell respectively. The assignment of H27 ene to chromosome 4M(v) is further supported by its linkage to a gene encoding isozyme Acph-M(v)1, previously located on chromosome 4M(v) in the line H-93-33. A new marker from homoeologous chromosome group 4 (Amp-M(v)2) present in H-93-33 and the 4M(v) addition line is described.

AB Aegilops markgrafii contains resistance genes to powdery mildew, leaf rust and stripe rust: and also has high crude protein and lysine contents, which can be useful for wheat improvement, These important traits are localized on different chromosomes. Disomic Triticum aestivum-Ae. markgrafii addition lines and euploid introgression lines showing leaf-rust and powdery mildew resistance were screened with RAPDs to detect chromosome-specific markers which can accelerate the breeding process, RAPD markers for all six available disomic addition lines were obtained. The additional chromosomes B, C, D, E, F and G were identified by three, three, three, two, one and seven primers, respectively. All three chromosome-B-specific RAPD markers demonstrated the presence of alien chromatin in the leaf-rust-resistant 42-chromosome introgression lines as well as in the segregating progeny. The three chromosome-C-identifying primers also demonstrated the presence of that chromosome in powdery mildew-resistant euploid introgression lines. The substitution lines (5A)5C and (5D)5C with different genetic backgrounds for both parents, in comparison to the lines mentioned above, showed the chromosome C-specific band with only two of the three primers. The chromosome F-specific primer and a primer evident on all the Ae. markgrafii chromosomes analysed did not generate the expected fragments on the chromosome F-del addition line, indicating that the markers are located on the deleted part of chromosome F.

AB A transient assay is described that should allow evaluation of the role of host genes in disease response by enhancing or disrupting expression of those genes in specific cells and looking for effects on disease development. The assay also has the potential for assessing utility of host and non-host genes in enhancing resistance to disease in transgenic plants. Particle bombardment with a helium discharge particle gun was utilized to transiently express genes in epidermal cells of coleoptiles of barley (Hordeum vulgare). An anthocyanin reporter gene construct provided a means of identifying those cells that were transiently expressing introduced DNA. Optimal transient expression rates were achieved two days following bombardment with 1800 psi helium pressure, 1.0 mu m diameter gold particles, and coleoptile pre- and post-treatment in 0.30-0.35 M mannitol/sorbitol. Under optimal conditions, at least 35 cells expressed anthocyanin per bombardment. Transiently expressing cells were inoculated with the fungal pathogen, Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei, and fungal development observed. Neither the bombardment procedures, the presence of nearby dead cells, nor accumulation of anthocyanin within living cells affected fungal development in living cells. Therefore, incorporation of disease-related genes onto the same plasmid as the reporter genes will allow evaluation of the role of those genes in disease development or suppression. Since particle bombardment is possible with a great range of different plant tissues, the described methodology should exhibit wide applicability for evaluating genes in diverse plant-pathogen interactions, as well as genes involved in many other biological processes.

Transient expression of GFP on the surface cells in the rice embryos depended on the localization of DNA coated gold particles. Bialaphos-resistant rice calli were produced by bombardment with a two plasmid mixture of pUbi-GFP and pDM302 carrying the coding region of the bar gene. Microscopic fluorescent image analyses indicated that the area of GFP expression increased and spreaded on the transgenic rice calli after heat stress. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI Expression of dominant marker genes of barley in wheat-barley hybrids
SO GENES & GENETIC SYSTEMS

DT Article
ID CHROMOSOMES
AB Seven dominant marker genes controlling morphological characters of barley were introduced into a wheat genetic background through hybridization between a Japanese bread wheat cultivar, Shinchunaga, and barley marker stocks. F-1 hybrids and their derivatives were analyzed by C-banding to confirm the presence and dosage of particular barley chromosomes carrying the marker genes. The genes for black lemma (B, located on chromosome 1H), pubescent leaf blade (Pub, 3H), hairy leaf sheath (Hs, 4H) and hooded lemma (K, 4H) were expressed in the F-1 hybrids, but generally to a lesser extent than in the parental barley accessions. F-1 hybrids having two copies of the B or Hs genes showed more pronounced phenotypes. In backcrossed progenies, each of which had a single copy of the barley marker gene in a hexaploid wheat background, the B and K phenotypes were less pronounced than in the F, hybrids, and the Pub phenotype was not observed. These four genes appear to be expressed in proportion to their dosage relative to the ploidy levels of the wheat background. The remaining three marker genes, brittle rachis (Bt-Bt2, 3H), blue aleurone (Pi, 4H) and short-upper-leaves (SuI) did not appear to express their characteristic phenotypes in any of the respective hybrids. Possible causes for reduced expression or complete suppression of the dominant barley genes in the wheat-barley hybrids are discussed. Dominant barley marker genes which are expressed in the hybrids would be useful for manipulating barley chromosomes in wheat backgrounds.

AB Screening for loose smut resistance in wheat is difficult. Selecting lines with DNA markers Linked to loose smut resistance would be more reliable and less costly. Molecular markers linked to a race TIO loose smut resistance gene were identified using a Fg Single seed descent segregating population. A RAPD marker and a RFLP marker were located on opposite flanks of the resistance gene and were shown to be loosely linked. The RAPD marker was converted to a user friendly polymorphic SCAR marker that represented a single genetically defined locus in hexaploid wheat. Using these two bracketing markers simultaneously, the error rate for TIO resistance selection due to crossing-over was reduced to 4%. These markers can be used for a faster and more reliable selection of TIO resistant plants than previous conventional loose smut ratings.

AB The gene Pch2 in 'Cappelle Desprez' is one of two genes found in hexaploid wheat known to confer resistance to eyespot disease. This study was conducted to develop an RFLP linkage map of the distal portion of wheat chromosome 7AL, and to locate and identify markers closely associated with Pch2 for use in marker-assisted selection. Ten loci in addition to Pch2 were mapped on chromosome 7AL, using segregation data from 102 homozygous chromosome 7A recombinant substitution lines derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'Chinese Spring' ('Cappelle Desprez' 7A). The Pch2 locus was bracketed by two RFLP markers, one 11.0 cM distal to Xcdo347 and the other 18.8 cM proximal to Xwg380. The position of Pch2 on chromosome 7AL is similar to that of Pch1 on chromosome 7DL, suggesting that these resistance genes are homoeoloci. Although no single marker was closely linked to Pch2, simultaneous selection of the flanking RFLP markers Xcdo347 and Xwg380 could be used for selecting Pch2, since double recombination occurred in only 3% of the recombinant population. The use of the flanking RFLP markers to select for Pch2, in combination with previously identified Pch1-linked markers, would facilitate the development of cultivars carrying two genes for resistance to eyespot.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia recondita Rob. ex Desm., is a common disease in wheat. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers associated with the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) putatively conferring durable leaf rust resistance in Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell. A population of 77 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from 'Parula' (resistant) and 'Siete Cerros' (moderately susceptible) was used. Bulked segregant analysis was done using random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) with DNA enriched for low-copy sequences using hydroxyapatite chromatography. Out of 400 decamer primers screened, 3 RAPD markers were identified between the bulk of the most resistant and the bulk of the most susceptible lines. These were cloned and used as probes on the RILs in Southern hybridizations. Two probes revealed two tightly linked loci. One-way analysis of variance showed that these two loci, and another revealed by the third probe, were linked to QTLs controlling leaf rust resistance based on data taken from 2 years of replicated field trials. Cytogenetic analysis placed the two tightly linked loci on the long arm of chromosome 7B. The third probe detected loci located on the short arms of chromosomes 1B and 1D. It is suggested that the QTL detected on 7BL may well be homoeoallelic to Lr34.

AB A cloned cDNA to the wheat (Triticum aestivum) early cysteine-labeled metallothionein has many characteristics of a molecular marker for pollen embryogenesis in this plant. This transcript was not detected in uninucleate microspores at the time of culture or in pollen at any stage during normal ontogeny; its mRNA did begin to increase in embryogenic microspores within 6 h of culture, peaked at around 24 h, declined, then leveled off through the 21-day-old embryoid stage. Additionally, the accumulation of the embryoid-abundant EcMt gene transcript showed a direct and positive correlation with an increase of ABA in embryogenic microspores and developing pollen embryoids. Irradiating cultures with high intensity white light or with far-red, or blue light, suppressed EcMt transcript accumulation and the ability of microspores to form embryoids; however, light did not affect ABA concentrations during the early stages of culture. These results suggest that although a promoter of pollen embryogenesis in bread wheat, ABA alone cannot maintain the sporophytic differentiation of microspores subjected to inhibitory regimes of light in vitro. Whether or not light acts directly or indirectly in suppressing EcMt gene expression and pollen embryogenesis remains unknown.

AB The development of large panels of simple-to-analyse genetic markers for tagging agronomically important genes and diversity studies in hexaploid bread wheat is an important goal in applied cereal genetic research. We have isolated and sequenced over 200 clones containing microsatellites from the wheat genome and have tested 153 primer pairs for genetic polymorphism using a panel of ten wheat varieties, including the parents of our main mapping cross. A subset comprising 49 primer pairs detects 76 loci, of which 74 can be unequivocably allocated to one of the wheat chromosomes. A relatively low frequency of the loci detected are from the D genome, and these loci show less polymorphism than those from the A and B genomes. Generally, the microsatellites show high levels of genetic polymorphism and an average of 3.5 alleles per locus with an average polymorphism information content (PIG), value of 0.51. The observed levels of polymorphism are positively correlated with the length of the microsatellite repeats. A high proportion, approximately two-thirds, of primer pairs designed to detect simple sequence repeat (SSR) variation in wheat do not generate the expected amplification products and, more significantly, often generate unresolvable PCR products. In general, our results agree closely with those obtained from other recent studies using microsatellites in plants.

AB The chromosomal position of Starch Branching Enzyme III (SBEIII) was determined via linkage to RFLP markers on an existing molecular map of rice (Oryza sativa L.). A cDNA of 890 bp was generated using specific PCR primers designed from available SBEIII sequence data and used as a probe in Southern analysis. The SBEIII cDNA hybridized to multiple restriction fragments, but these fragments mapped to a single locus on rice chromosome 2, flanked by CD0718 and RG157. The detection of a multiple-copy hybridization pattern suggested the possibility of a tandemly duplicated gene at this locus. The map location of orthologous SEE genes in maize, wheat, and oat were predicted based on previously published genetic studies and comparative maps of the grass family.

AB The present work was undertaken to determine if virulence in the Hessian fly operates on a gene-for-gene basis with respect to resistance gene H13, an undeployed gene for resistance being incorporated into wheat cultivars for Hessian fly protection, Results revealed virulence was controlled by a single recessive, sex-linked gene (virulence to H13, vrH13), Additionally, genetic analysis of virulent/avirulent phenotypes confirmed previous observations that males express only maternally derived sex chromosomes in the soma, Segregation of white and dark eye color in H13 virulent F-2 backcross individuals showed a significant (P < .001) deviation from the expected 1:1 phenotypic ratio, which indicated the locus controlling the white-eye trait was linked to the locus controlling virulence to H13. Recombination frequency between the white allele and vrH13 was 24.3 +/- 0.02%. Application of knowledge concerning the genetic control of virulence in the Hessian fly to resistance in wheat is discussed with respect to the pyramiding of resistance genes in wheat, and use of the white-eye phenotype to facilitate identifying molecular markers linked to H13 virulence is described.

AB The NADPH-dependent HC-toxin reductase (HCTR), encoded by Hm1 in maize, inactivates HC-toxin produced by the fungus Cochliobolus carbonum, and thus confers resistance to the pathogen. The fact that e. carbonum only infects maize (Zea mays) and is the only species known to produce HC-toxin raises the question: What are the biological functions of HCTR in other plant species? An HCTR-like enzyme may function to detoxify toxins produced by pathogens which infect other plant species (R. B. Meeley; G. S. Johal, S. E. Briggs, and J. D. Walton, Plant Cell, 4:71-77, 1992). Hm1 homolog in rice (Y. Hihara, M. Umeda, C. Hara, Q. Liu, S. Aotsuka, K. Toriyama, and H. Uchimiya, unpublished) and HCTR activity in barley, wheat, oats and sorghum have been reported (R. B. Meeley and J. D. Walton, Plant Physiol. 97:1080-1086, 1993). To investigate the sequence conservation of Hm1 and HCTR in barley and the possible relationship of barley Hm1 homolog to the known disease resistance genes, we droned and mapped a barley (Hordeum vulgare) Hm1-like gene. A putative full-length cDNA clone, Bhm1-18, was isolated from a cDNA library consisting of mRNA from young leaves, inflorescences, and immature embryos. This 1,297-bp clone encodes 363 amino acids which show great similarity (81.6%) with the amino acid sequence of HM1 in maize. Two loci were mapped to barley molecular marker linkage maps with Bhm1-18 as the probe; locus A (Bhm1A) on the long arm of chromosome 1, and locus B (Bhm1B) on the short arm of chromosome 1 which is syntenic to maize chromosome 9 containing the Hm2 locus. The Bhm1-18 probe hybridized strongly to a Southern blot of a wide range of grass species, indicating high conservation of HCTR at the DNA sequence level among grasses. The HCTR mRNA was detected in barley roots, leaves, inflorescences, and immature embryos. The conservation of the HCTR sequence, together with its expression in other plant species (R. B. Meeley and J. D. Walton, Plant Physiol. 97:1080-1086, 1993), suggests HCTR plays an important functional role in other plant species.

AB The pyramiding of genes that confer race- or biotype-specfic resistance has become increasingly attractive as a breeding strategy now that DNA-based marker-assisted selection is feasible. Our objective here was to identify DNA markers closely linked to genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that condition resistance to Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)]. We used a set of near-isogenic wheat lines, each carrying a resistance gene at 1 of 11 loci (H3, H5, H6, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H16 or H17) and developed by backcrossing to the Hessian fly-susceptible wheat cultivar 'Newton'. Using genomic DNA of these 11 lines and 'Newton', we have identified 18 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to the 11 resistance genes. Seven of these markers were identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the others by agarose gel electrophoresis. We confirmed linkage to the Hessian fly resistance loci by cosegregation analysis in Fz populations of 50-120 plants for each different gene. Several of the DNA markers were used to determine the presence/absence of specific Hessian fly resistance genes in resistant wheat lines that have 1 or possibly multiple genes for resistance. The use of RAPD markers presents a valuable strategy for selection of single and combined Hessian fly resistance genes in wheat improvement.

AB Four DNA fragments were amplified specifically from the B chromosome by PCR using random 10-base oligonucleotides as primers. The location of the fragments in the B chromosome was determined based on whether or not they were amplified from the hypoploid DNA generated by four B-A translocations, three of which break in the proximal euchromatic region and the fourth in the distal one-third of the heterochromatic region on the B long arm. Since the hypoploid DNA carries the portion of the B chromosome distal to the breakpoint of a translocation, the presence of a fragment in the hypoploid DNA, but not in the control (which is devoid of any B chromatin), indicates that the fragments is located in the B region distal to the break-point in the B long arm. Two fragments were mapped to the euchromatic region and two others to either the distal portion of the euchromatic region or the proximal two-thirds of the heterochromatic region. These fragments in turn mapped three B-A translocations whose breakpoints were located in the euchromatic region.

AB A gene encoding (1 --> 4)-beta-xylan xylanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.8) isoenzyme X-I has been isolated from a barley genomic library and the nucleotide sequence of a 2704-bp fragment defined. The gene contains a single intron of 91 bp in the coding region of the mature enzyme and additional introns may be present in the 5'-untranslated region. Expression of the xylanase gene is restricted to the aleurone layer of germinated grain, where the phytohormone gibberellic acid induces both transcriptional activity of the gene and the secretion of active enzyme from the layers. Abscisic acid abolishes the gibberellic acid induction of xylanase gene expression. The hormonal responses are consistent with the presence of promoter sequences, all of which are within 150 bp of the putative transcription start site, that have been implicated as cis-acting elements within gibberellic acid response complexes in plant genes. The elements include a pyrimidine box, CTCTTTCC, together with TAACGAC and TATCCAT boxes. Three genes encode (1 --> 4)-beta-xylanase isoenzymes in barley and these have been mapped on the barley genome using two doubled haploid populations and seven wheat-barley addition lines. The three xylanase genes are closely linked on the long arm of chromosome 7 (5H). No recombination was detected between the genes in 234 doubled haploid lines. The genes are flanked by the RFLP markers CDO506 on the proximal side and PSR370 at the distal end.

AB We examined the effects of NGF on the TGC (trophoblastic giant cell) transformation of the ectoplacental cone (EPC) cells derived from the mouse pregnant uteri on day 7.5 p.c. The addition of NGF strongly accelerated the rate of the TGC transformation of EPC cells in a dose-dependent manner. The promoting action of NGF was abolished by the addition of anti-NGF MAb. Histochemical staining with succinyl wheat germ agglutinin (s-WGA), an in situ marker for the TGCs on day 10.5 p.c., revealed that NGF induced the expression of s-WGA-binding glycoproteins in TGCs in vitro, RNA analysis revealed that NGF mRNA was expressed in the pregnant uterus on day 7.5 p.c., mainly in the decidua, but it could not be detected in the EPC, p75(NGFR) mRNA was expressed in the EPCs, whereas TrkA mRNA was not detected in the placental tissues throughout day 7.5 to 10.5 p.c. We therefore conclude that maternally derived NGF may play a role in mouse placentation by promoting the giant-cell transformation of trophoblast cells through p75(NGFR). (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Using four marker genotypes of F-2 hybrids derived from crosses between aphid resistant and susceptible barley lines, the effects of leaf color, epicuticular wax and gramine indole alkaloid on aphid infestation were studied in natural populations of cereal aphids, mainly the corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) during 1994-1995. Resistant lines, OUH603 and OUH689 (Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum), were the normal type (green waxy) with a higher amount of gramine. However, a susceptible line, OUL117 (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare), was the yellow waxless type with a lower content of gramine. In the F-2 populations of OUL117 x OUH689, OUH603 x OUL117 and OUL117 x OUH603, the aphid densities on the marker genotypes were low in the normal type, intermediate in the green waxless and yellow waxy types, and high in the yellow waxless type. Gramine content was low and did not differ significantly among the genotypes measured in 158 F-2 plants of OUL117 x OUH689 in 1994. Additionally, there was no significant correlation between aphid density and gramine content within each genotype in the F-2 populations. These results showed that the genes controlling color and wax types had additive effects on normal plant genotype resistance to aphids, but did not affect gramine content.

AB Eleven wheat-Ae. umbellulata recombinant lines involving chromosome 1U, including an important high-molecular-weight glutenin locus, were characterized by protein and RFLP markers. Four 1U-1A recombinants, one 1U-1B recombinant, two 1U deletions with either nullisomy for chromosome 1A or 1B and a 1U ditelosomic addition line were detected, while 3 recombinant lines involved 1U and non-homoeologous wheat chromosomes. Similar recombination events were found in independent lines, and no small segmental translocations of Ae. umbellulata chromatin were detected. Correlation of the markers with physical maps of the wheat-Ae. umbellulata breakpoints obtained using in situ hybridization enabled the marker order to be established on chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1U. The short arm of chromosome 1A probably differs from both 1U and IB by one inversion. As now being found to be universal in the Triticeae, clustering of the genetical map in the distal physical regions of the group chromosomes was found.

AB An optimized procedure for transformation of wheat with the use of a Biolistic Particle Delivery System PDS 1000/He to deliver foreign DNA is described in detail. The bacterial uidA and bar genes (both driven by plant promoters) were utilized as the reporter and selectable marker genes, respectively. Moderately high gas pressure appeared to be most important to achieve the highest level of transient GUS expression in target tissues. There was, however, no apparent correlation between transient and stable GUS expression. The presence of telomeric DNA sequences in an uidA gene-containing vector did not influence transient GUS expression but, apparently, prevented its stable expression. Mechanical lesions caused by the bombardment (tungsten particles) seemed to be less severe when embryo-derived calli, instead of freshly excised immature embryos, were used as the target tissue. The limited ability of callus cells for regeneration, together with a restricted number of cells that receive the foreign DNA by particle bombardment, result in a low efficiency of wheat stable transformation.

AB Bacteria released in large numbers for biocontrol or bioremediation purposes might exchange genes with other microorganisms. Two model systems were designed to investigate the likelihood of such an exchange and some factors which govern the conjugative exchange of chromosomal genes between root-colonizing pseudomonads in the rhizosphere of wheat. The first model consisted of the biocontrol strain CHA0 of Pseudomonas fluorescens and transposon facilitated recombination (Tfr). A conjugative IncP plasmid loaded,vith transposon Tn5, in a CHA0 derivative carrying a chromosomal Tn5 insertion, promoted chromosome transfer to auxotrophic CHA0 recipients in vitro. A chromosomal marker (pro) was transferred at a frequency of about 10(-6) per donor on wheat roots under gnotobiotic conditions, provided that the Tfr donor and recipient populations each contained 10(6) to 10(7) CFU per g of root. In contrast, no conjugative gene transfer was detected in soil, illustrating that the root surface stimulates conjugation. The second model system was based on the genetically well-characterized strain PAO of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the chromosome mobilizing IncP plasmid R68.45. Although originally isolated from a human wound, strain PAO1 was found to be an excellent root colonizer, even under natural, nonsterile conditions. Matings between an auxotrophic R68.45 donor and auxotrophic recipients produced prototrophic chromosomal recombinants at 10(-4) to 10(-5) per donor on wheat roots in artificial soil under gnotobiotic conditions and at about 10(-6) per donor on wheat roots in natural, nonsterile soil microcosms after 2 weeks of incubation. The frequencies of chromosomal recombinants were as high as or higher than the frequencies of R68.45 transconjugants, reflecting mainly the selective growth advantage of the prototrophic recombinants over the auxotrophic parental strains in the rhizosphere. Although under field conditions the formation of chromosomal recombinants is expected to be reduced by several factors, we conclude that chromosomal genes, whether present naturally or introduced by genetic modification, may be transmissible between rhizosphere bacteria.

AB Until recently, no method was available to identify and quantify individual Fusarium species present within plant tissue. Specific DNA markers have been identified for the Fusarium species which are predominant components of the 'Fusarium ear blight complex' (scab) and 'stem-base complex' of cereals. Assays based upon the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed for detection of several of these fungi in DNA extracts from plant tissue. These assays have been refined to enable quantification of each species, allowing the relative contribution of each component to the disease of the plant to be estimated. Examples of the use of PCR techniques in host resistance and epidemiological studies involving F. poae, F. culmorum, Gibberella zeae (F. graminearum), G. avenacea (F. avenaceum) and M. nivale varieties is presented. The role of trichothecene mycotoxins in the pathogenicity of Fusarium species towards cereals is also being investigated and visual disease scoring and quantitative PCR are being used to investigate the effects of Tri5 gene disruption of G. zeae on the infection of seedlings and ears of wheat.

AB Five South African wheat cultivars and five foreign Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko) resistance source cultivars were fingerprinted using RAPD analysis. These cultivars are being used in breeding programs aimed at developing new D. noxia resistant wheat cultivars. Cultivar, genome and species specific markers were produced through RAPD analysis of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) and rye (Secale cereale L.) genomic DNA using twenty nine oligonucleotide primers. These markers were used to construct a RAPD fingerprinting profile that distinguished all the cultivars included in the study. A total of 239 scorable RAPD loci were used to calculate pairwise genetic distances which revealed an average distance of 6.9% between the local susceptible and foreign resistance source cultivars. Unweighted pair-group mean arithmetic (UPGMA) cluster analysis of the genetic distance data yielded a dendrogram that was consistent with the known genetic relationships and pedigrees of the cultivars in the study.

AB Four members belonging to the wheat Fm gene family were isolated by PCR, cloned and subsequently sequenced. One of the genes corresponds perfectly to a previous published cDNA sequence, the other three genes are new. The amplified sequences contain the entire coding region, which is interrupted by a short intron of variable length, and part of the 3' untranslated region. The chromosomal assignment of each of the four sequences and three extra, previously published, Em sequences was determined using PCR with sequence-specific primers on wheat aneuploid nullitetrasomic lines. Three sequences were shown to be encoded by the Em-A1 locus (on chromosome 1A), one by Em-B1 on chromosome 1B and two by Em-D1 on chromosome 1D. Hence, primer sets specific for each of the three homoeologous chromosomes of the group 1 are available. A lot of DNA sequence polymorphism exists among the sequences most of which is found in the non-coding parts and mainly in the introns. Sequence alignment groups the seven known Em sequences irrespective of their locus origin. The implication of these findings in relation to the organisation and evolution of the Em gene family are discussed.

ID CHROMOSOMES; WHEAT; RYE
AB 92% of the rice genome (4.3 x 10(8) bp, 2n = 24) was covered by 631 contigs of various length, which were generated by fingerprinting from a representative and genetically stable bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of the Guang Lu Ai 4 (a O. Sativa variety) genome with the average insert of 120 kb in length. To form the contig map, 565 molecular markers of RFLP, STS, cDNA and anchor set derived from two O. Sativa varieties were by colony hybridization mapped to the contigs, which were then assigned to and ordered along the particular chromosomes according to the marker colinearity. Being highly conserved DNA sequences shared among the genomes of rice, barley, wheat, oat, maize, sorghum and sugar cane, 89 anchor markers mapped help to identify the rice genes through the information provided by the maps of relative genomes, and vice versa. Numerous repeated DNA sequences of various length were identified and mapped to the chromosomes. Physical distances have been determined for hundreds pairs of adjacent markers, which would facilitate the identification by map-based cloning the rice genes of interest. The accuracy of clone overlaps in contigs was further confirmed by the existence in contigs of well fit stacks of marker-lodged clones independently identified by hybridization. Large scale DNA sequencing of individual chromosomes could now be initiated simply by selecting and sequencing the minimally overlapped BAC clones of the contigs.

AB Genetic progress through selection is directly related to the amount of variability present in the population and the quality of genes contributed by the parents. Genetic relationships between lines were studied using DNA marker-based estimates of genetic similarity. A statistical methodology using the width of a confidence interval was developed to determine the number of probes to be surveyed and the precision in the estimation of genetic distance between pairs of cultivars. Precision was affected by type of genetic distance used, the number of cultivars, and amount of genetic diversity present in the studied group. The width of a (1-alpha)% confidence interval decreased as the number of RFLP fragments increased. Oat and wheat diversity studies were used to illustrate the methodology.

AB Sr2, an important source of durable resistance to the wheat stem rust pathogen, is linked with a distinctive seedling chlorosis gene sc. The expression of sc is sensitive to temperature and light. The chlorosis can be induced by inoculation with the stem rust or leaf rust pathogens and also develops on uninfected leaves of rusted plants. This chlorosis is an excellent marker for Sr2 which previously was best monitored by the appearance of pseudo-black chaff on glumes or upper stem or the expression of resistance. However, the latter are only detected late in the season on field-grown adult plants.
   Chlorosis was recessive in F1 hybrids, however, it segregated in a dominant manner in some F3 lines presumably due to the presence of modifying genes.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling salt tolerance at germination and the seedling stage in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were identified by interval mapping analysis using marker information from two doubled haploid (DH) populations derived from the crosses, Steptoe/Morex and Harrington/TR306.
   Interval mapping analysis revealed that the QTLs for salt tolerance at germination in the DH lines of Steptoe/Morex were located on chromosomes 4(4H), 6(6H), and 7(5H), and in the DH lines of Harrington/TR306 on chromosomes 5(1H) and 7(5H). In both DH populations, the most effective QTLs were found at different loci on chromosome 7(5H). Genetic linkage between salt tolerance at germination and abscisic acid (ABA) response was found from QTL mapping. The QTLs for the most effective ABA response at germination were located very close to those for salt tolerance on chromosome 7(5H) in both crosses.
   The QTLs for salt tolerance at the seedling stage were located on chromosomes 2(2H), 5(1H), 6(6H), and 7(5H) in the DH lines of Steptoe/Morex, and on chromosome 7(5H) in the DH lines of Harrington/TR306. Their positions were different from those of QTLs controlling salt tolerance at germination, indicating that salt tolerance at germination and at the seedling stage were controlled by different loci.

AB An RFLP map constructed from 99 doubled haploid lines of a cross between two spring barley varieties (Blenheim x Kym) was used to localize quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling grain yield and yield components by marker regression and single-marker analysis. Trials were conducted over three years. Genotype-by-year interaction was detected for plant grain weight and ear grain weight so they were analysed separately for each year. None was detected for thousand-grain weight and ear grain number so data were pooled over years. A total of eleven QTL were detected for plant grain weight over two years and fourteen for ear grain weight over three years. Seven QTL were detected for plot yield. The locus with the largest effect was on chromosome 2(2H)L and accounted for 19% of the Variation in the progeny. Eight QTL were detected for thousand-grain weight and five for ear grain number. Many of the QTL detected were in comparable positions in each year. Yield and yield components were only partly correlated. Comparisons based on common RFLP markers showed that some QTL were found in positions similar to those identified in other studies. For a number of QTL the identification of linked markers provided suitable opportunities for marker-assisted selection and improvement of barley and reference markers with which to analyse the homoeologous chromosome regions of wheat and other cereals.

ID PLANT-DISEASE RESISTANCE; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM
AB We recently showed that the Lr10 wheat leaf rust resistance gene cosegregated with the candidate resistance gene Lrk10 which encodes a putative receptor-like kinase. The aim of this study was to develop Lrk10-derived molecular markers for the detection of the Lr10 gene in breeding material. Different subfragments of Lrk10 were tested as RFLP markers for the Lr10 resistance gene. The most specific fragment (Lrk10-6) was converted into the PCR-based STS marker STSLrk10-6. Both the RFLP and the STS marker did not give a signal with near isogenic lines containing a different Lr gene. The applicability of these markers for the detection of Lr10 in genetically diverse material was tested with 62 wheat and spelt breeding lines, mostly from European breeding programmes. Twelve varieties known to have Lr10 showed the same alleles as the originally characterized line ThatcherLr10. Most of the lines with unknown composition at the Lr10 locus had a null allele with both the RFLP marker Lrk10-6 and the marker STSLrk10-6 whereas 20% of the lines had a different allele. For six lines, including a traditional spelt variety derived from a landrace, both markers showed the same allele as Thatcher Lr10. Artificial infections of these lines with an isolate avirulent on Lr10 resulted in a hypersensitive reaction of all these lines, indicating also the presence of the Lr10 resistance gene. These data demonstrate that the markers derived from sequences of Lrk10 are highly specific for the Lr10 gene in breeding material of very diverse genetic origin. The markers will allow the defined deployment of Lr10 in wheat breeding programmes and will contribute to the elucidation of the role of Lr10 in polygenic resistances against leaf rust.

AB Near-isogenic lines in conjunction with bulked segregant analysis were used to identify a DNA marker in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) associated with the H21 gene conferring resistance to biotype L of Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. Near-isogenic lines were developed by backcross introgression BC3F3:4 ('Coker 797' *4/'Hamlet') and differed by the presence or absence of H21 (on 2RL) derived from 'Chaupon' rye (Secale cereale L.). Bulked DNA samples were prepared from near-isogenic lines and BC3F2 population individuals segregating for reaction to Hessian fly biotype L and screened for random amplified polymorphic DNA markers using 46 10mer primers. Random-amplified polymorphic DNA markers from resistant and susceptible individuals and parental lines were scored and these data were used to identify a 3 kb DNA fragment that was related to the occurrence of H21. This fragment was amplified from DNA isolated from Hamlet, a near-isogenic line carrying 2RL, and bulked DNA from resistant BC3F2 individuals, but not from the recurrent parent Coker 797 or DNA bulks from susceptible BC3F2 plants. Analysis of 111 BC3F2 segregating individuals and BC3F2:3 segregants confirmed the co-segregation of the 3 kb DNA marker with the H21 resistance gene to Hessian fly. Use of this marker could facilitate more rapid screening of plant populations for Hessian fly resistance and monitoring the introgression of H21.

TI Molecular cloning of a new receptor-like kinase gene encoded at the Lr10

AB More than 100 resistance genes against wheat rust pathogens have been described in wheat and its relatives. Although many of them have been extensively used in wheat resistance breeding, none of these resistance loci has yet been analyzed at the molecular revel. By screening a set of near-isogenic lines carrying different leaf rust resistance genes with a wheat probe encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase, we detected a polymorphic DNA fragment in the line with the Lr10 resistance gene. This fragment mapped to the Lr10 disease resistance locus and encodes a receptor-like protein kinase which we called LRK10. LRK10 contains a new type of extracellular domain not found in known plant or animal receptor kinases. Several conserved amino acids in S-domain glycoproteins and receptor-like kinases were also found in LRK10, suggesting that LRK10 and S-domain proteins belong to the same superfamily of specific recognition molecules in plants. Lrk10 was expressed at low revels in young seedlings and belongs to a gene family. Analysis of wheat lines with and without the Lr10 gene demonstrated that Lrk10 and Lr10 belong td the same genetic locus. We conclude that gene isolation based on protein kinase homology can identify new receptor domains and provide candidates for disease resistance genes in the complex wheat genome.

AB Chlorotoluron is a selective phenylurea herbicide widely used for broad-leaved and annual grass weed control in cereals. Variation in the response to chlorotoluron (CT) was found in both hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and wild tetraploid wheat (Triticum dicoccoides KERN.). Here, we describe the comparative mapping of the CT resistance gene (Su1) on chromosome 6B in bread and wild wheat using RFLP markers. In bread wheat, mapping was based on 58 F-4 single-seed descent (SSD) plants of the cross between a genotype sensitive to chlorotoluron, 'Chinese Spring' (CS), and a resistant derivative, the single chromosome substitution line, CS ('Cappele-Desprez' 6B) CCS (CAP6B). In T. dicoccoides, mapping was based on 37 F-2 plants obtained from the cross between the CT-susceptible accession B-7 and the resistant accession B-35. Nine RFLP probes spanning the centromere were chosen for mapping. In bread wheat Su1 was found to be linked to alpha-Amy-1 (9.84 cM) and Xpsr371 (5.2 cM), both on the long arm of 6B, and Nor2 (2.74 cM) on the short arm. In wild wheat the most probable linkage map was Nor2-Xpsr312-Su1-Pgk2, and the genetic distances between the genes were 24.8 cM, 5.3 cM, and 6.8 cM, respectively. These results along with other published map data indicate that the linear order of the genes is similar to that found in T. aestivum. The results of this study also show that the Su1 gene for differential response to chlorotoluron has evolved prior to the domestication of cultivated wheat and not in response to the development and use of chemicals.

AB Microsatellites consisting of AT repeats are highly polymorphic in rice genomes and can be used to distinguish between even closely related japonica cultivars in Japan. Polymorphisms of 20 microsatellite loci were determined using 59 japonica cultivars, including both domestic and modern Japanese cultivars. Although the polymorphisms of these 20 microsatellite loci indicated that the Japanese cultivars were genetically quite similar, microsatellites consisting of AT repeats showed high gene diversity even among such closely related cultivars. Combinations of these hypervariable microsatellites can be employed to classify individual cultivars, since the microsatellites were stable within each cultivar. An identification system based on these highly polymorphic microsatellites could be used to maintain the purity of rice seeds by eliminating contamination. A parentage diagnosis using 17 polymorphic microsatellite loci clearly demonstrated that plants which carried desired chromosome regions had been selected in breeding programs. Thus, these hypervariable microsatellites consisting of AT repeats should promote the selection of plants which carry desired chromosomes from genetically similar parents. Backcrossing could also help to eliminate unnecessary chromosome regions with microsatellite polymorphisms at an early stage in breeding programs.

AB To study the relationships between different species of the Einkorn group, 408 accessions of Triticum monococcum, T. boeoticum, T. boeoticum ssp. thauodar and T. urartu were analyzed electrophoretically for their protein composition at the Gli-1 and Gli-2 loci. In all the species the range of allelic variation at the loci examined is remarkable. The gliadin patterns of T. monococcum and T. boeoticum were very similar to one another but differed substantially from those of T. urartu. Several accessions of T. boeoticum and T. monococcum were shown to share the same alleles at the Gli-1 and Gli-2 loci, confirming the recent nomenclature that considers these wheats as different subspecies of the same species, T. monococcum. The gliadin composition of T. urartu resembled that of the A genome of polyploid wheats more than did T. boeoticum or T. monococcum, supporting the hypothesis that T. urartu, rather than T. boeoticum, is the donor of the A genome in cultivated wheats. Because of their high degree of polymorphism the gliadin markers may help in selecting breeding parents from diploid wheat germ plasm collections and can be used both to search for valuable genes linked to the gliadin-coding loci and to monitor the transfer of alien genes into cultivated polyploid wheats.

AB Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an economically important disease in major wheat production areas. The fungus can produce two genetically distinct symptoms on leaves of susceptible wheat genotypes: tan necrosis (nec) and extensive chlorosis (chl). Our objectives were to determine the number of genes conditioning resistance to tan spot in a population of wheat recombinant inbred lines, and map the chromosomal location of the resistance genes using RFLPs. Conidia produced by the P. tritici-repentis isolate Pti2 (nec + chl +) were used to inoculate seedlings of 135 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of the synthetic hexaploid wheat W-7984 with Opata 85. A subset of the population was inoculated with conidia produced by the isolates D308 (nec - chl +) and 86-124 (nec + chl -). Inoculated seedlings were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 based on lesion type. Necrosis-inducing culture filtrate produced by the isolate 86-124 was also used to screen the entire population. A map consisting of 532 markers was employed to identify significant associations between marker loci and tan spot resistance. The entire population was insensitive to culture filtrate produced by the isolate 86-124, and the entire subset was resistant to conidial inoculation of the same isolate. The population segregated for reaction to isolates D308 and Pti2, indicating that this population segregates for resistance to extensive chlorosis only, and not to tan necrosis. RFLP analysis indicated the presence of a gene with a major effect in 1AS, a gene with a minor effect in 4AL, and an interaction between the 1AS gene and a gene in 2DL. Together, these loci explained 49.0% of the variation in this population for resistance to tan spot produced by the isolate Pti2. Two regions one in 1BL and one in 3BL, were significantly associated with resistance to extensive chlorosis, but were not significant in the multiple regression model. It should be feasible to introgress these resistance loci into adapted genetic backgrounds by using a marker-assisted selection scheme.

AB The effectiveness of kanamycin, geneticin G-418, neomycin, hygromycin and basta as selection agents to inhibit the growth of embryogenic calli derived from oil palm immature embryos were evaluated. Due to the slow process of the oil palm tissue culture and its regeneration, the presence of an efficient selection system is essential in reducing or eliminating chimerics. Embryogenic calli were cultured on media containing selection agents at different concentrations ranging from 1 to 2000mg/l for a period of one month. The effectiveness of the selection agents at a particular concentration was established using a specific formula which provides the percentage of proliferation compared to controls. Of five compounds tested, hygromycin and basta at 40mg/l were suitable as selection agents for oil palm as they fully inhibited growth of the embryogenic calli. The other three (kanamycin, geneticin G-418 and neomycin) were unsuitable both economically (cost effectiveness) and biologically, as they allowed proliferation of oil palm embryogenic calli at 2000mg/l. Transformation of oil palm with the genes conferring resistance to basta and hygromycin would act as suitable selection markers for oil palm transformation.

AB We studied the distribution of genes and recombination in wheat (Triticum aestivum) group 1 chromosomes by comparing high-density physical and genetic maps. Physical maps of chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D were generated by mapping 50 DNA markers on 56 single-break deletion lines. A consensus physical map was compared with the 1D genetic map of Triticum tauschii (68 markers) and a Triticeae group 1 consensus map (288 markers) to generate a cytogenetic ladder map (CLM). Most group 1 markers (86%) were present in five clusters that encompassed only 10% of the group 2 chromosome. This distribution may reflect that of genes because more than half of the probes were cDNA clones and 30% were PstI genomic. All 14 agronomically important genes in group 1 chromosomes were present in these clusters. Most recombination occurred in gene-cluster regions. Markers fell at an average distance of 244 kb in these regions. The CLM involving the Triticeae consensus genetic map revealed that the above distribution of genes and recombination is the same in other Triticeae species. Because of a significant number of common markers, our CLM can be used for comparative mapping and to estimate physical distances among markers in many Poaceae species including rice and maize.

AB Genetic relationship can be a useful predictor of the relative performance of hybrid combinations for a hybrid breeding program resulting in reduced time and cost of hybrid testing. Genetic relationships of 112 wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell.) lines were estimated using 41 DNA clones hybridizing to 273 DNA fragments and by calculating coefficient of parentage (COP). Heterosis was estimated for 722 hybrids grown in multiple locations, with 189 being tested in more than 1 year. The average RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) based genetic distance index (DI) was 0.35. Midparent heterosis for grain yield ranged from -20 to 57% and high-parent heterosis from -22 to 47%. The correlation between RFLP-based estimates of genetic distance and COP was nonsignificant (-0.33). Coefficient of parentage was significantly correlated with heterosis for all traits in 1991 but not in other years. Genetic distance based on RFLPs scored in this study was not correlated with heterosis in any of the years tested. Further refinement of gene pools and new prediction methods will be required to facilitate the exploitation of genetic variability for hybrid wheat improvement.

AB A clone for an embryoid-abundant, early cysteine-labeled metallothionein (EcMt) gene has been isolated from a wheat pollen embryoid cDNA library. The transcript of this gene was only expressed in embryogenic microspores, pollen embryoids, and developing zygotic embryos of wheat. Accumulation of the EcMt mRNA showed a direct and positive correlation with an increase of the plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA) in developing pollen embryoids. Treating cultures with an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, fluridone, suppressed not only ABA accumulation but also the appearance of the EcMt gene transcript and the ability of microspores to form embryoids. These results suggest that the EcMt gene may act as a molecular marker for pollen embryogenesis because ABA biosynthesis is accompanied by the increased expression of the EcMt transcript that coincides with the differentiation of pollen embryoids in wheat anther cultures.

AB Using a recently developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated approach for physical mapping of single-copy DNA sequences on microisolated chromosomes of barley, sequence-tagged sites of DNA probes that reveal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) localized on the linkage maps of rice chromosomes 5 and 10 were allocated to cytologically defined regions of barley chromosome 5 (1H). The rice map of linkage group 5, of about 135 cM in size, falls into two separate parts, which are related to the distal portions of both the short and long arms of the barley chromosome. The markers on the rice map of chromosome 5 were found to be located within regions of the barley chromosome which show high recombination rates. The map of rice chromosome 10, of about 75 cM in size, on the other hand, is related to an interstitial segment of the long arm of chromosome 5 (1H) which is highly suppressed in recombination activity. For positional cloning of genes of this homoeologous region from the barley genome, the small rice genome will probably prove to be a useful tool. No markers located on rice chromosomes were detected within the pericentric Giemsa-positive heterochromatin of the barley chromosome, indicating that these barley-specific sequences form a block which separates the linkage segments conserved in rice. By our estimate approximately half of the barley-specific sequences of chromosome 5 (1H) show a dispersed distribution, while the other half separates the conserved linkage segments.

AB A synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (pgfp) was constructed to improve GFP expression in plants. Corn and tobacco protoplast transient assays showed that pgfp gave about 20-fold brighter fluorescence than the wild-type gene (gfp). Replacement of the serine at position 65 with a threonine (S65Tpgfp) or a cysteine (S65Cpgfp) yielded 100- to 120-fold brighter fluorescence than wild-type gfp upon excitation with 490-nm light. Incorporation of a plant intron into the coding region yielded an additional 1.4-fold improvement, for a cumulative improvement of about 150-fold in fluorescence at 490-nm excitation. Various versions of pgfp were also stably introduced into corn, wheat, tobacco, and Arabidopsis plants. Bright-green fluorescence was observed with a fluorescence microscope in virtually all examined tissues of transgenic monocots and dicots. In the case of Arabidopsis, expression of the pgfp gene under the enhanced 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus produced green fluorescence that was readily detectable by eye using a hand-held, long-wave ultraviolet lamp and/or a black-light source.

AB Primers for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were tailored to selectively amplify RFLP marker alleles associated with resistance and susceptibility for powdery mildew in cereals. The differentiation between marker alleles for susceptible and resistant genotypes is based on the discrimination of a single nucleotide by using allele-specific oligonucleotides as PCR primers. The PCR assays developed are diagnostic for RFLP alleles at the loci MWG097 in the barley genome and Whs350 in the wheat genome. The first marker locus is closely linked to MlLa resistance in barley, while the latter is linked to Pm2 resistance locus in wheat. PCR analysis of 31 barley and 30 wheat cultivars, with some exceptions, verified the presence or absence of the resistance loci investigated. These rapid PCR-based approaches are proposed as an efficient alternative to conventional procedures for selecting powdery mildew-resistant genotypes in breeding programs.

AB A genetic map of six chromosomes of rye, (all of the rye chromosomes except for 2R), was constructed using 77 RFLP and 12 RAPD markers. The map was developed using an F-2 population of 54 plants from a cross between two inbred lines. A rye genomic library was constructed as a source of clones for RFLP mapping. Comparisons were made between the rye map and other rye and wheat maps by including additional probes previously mapped in those species. These comparisons allowed (1) chromosome arm orientation to the linkage groups to be given, (2) the corroboration of several evolutionary translocations between rye chromosomes and homoeologous chromosomes of wheat; (3) an increase in the number of available markers for target regions of rye that show colinearity with wheat. Inconsistencies in the location of markers between the wheat and rye maps were mostly detected by multi-copy probes.

AB We have explored different domains within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 5' noncoding region as potential targets for inhibition of HCV translation by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). Inhibition assays were performed with two different cell-free systems, rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ extract, and three types of chemical structures for the ODNs were evaluated: natural phosphodiesters (beta-PO), alpha-anomer phosphodiesters (alpha-PO), and phosphorothioates (PS), A total of six original ODNs, displaying sequence-specific inhibition ranging from 62 to 96%, that mapped in the pyrimidine-rich tract (nucleotides [nt] 104 to 127) and in the initiator AUG codon (nt 338 to 357) were identified, Two ODNs, which were targeted at the initiatory AUG (nt 341 to 367 and 351 to 377) and which had been previously described as active against genotype Ib and 2a sequences, were shown to exhibit inhibition of expression (>95%) of a type la sequence, Control experiments with the irrelevant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase sequence as a marker and randomized ODNs demonstrated that levels of inhibition associated with the use of PS compounds (of as much as 94%) were mainly due to nonspecific effects, Both alpha- and beta-PO ODNs were found equally active, and no difference could be seen in the activity of beta-PO when it was tested in either rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract, suggesting that RNase H-independent mechanisms may be involved in the inhibitions observed, However, specific RNA cleavage products generated from beta-PO inhibition experiments could be identified, indicating that, with these compounds, control of translation also involves RNase II-dependent mechanisms, This study further delimits the existence of favorable target sequences for the action of ODNs within the HCV 5' noncoding region and indicates the possibility of using nuclease-resistant alpha-PO compounds in cellular studies.

AB Genetic diversity of eighteen accessions of Ae. geniculata (2n = 28; UUMM) was assessed using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. We optimized RAPD conditions including the template DNA, the concentration of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase Stoffel fragment, and MgCl2 concentration for revealing polymorphisms. Thirty-eight decamer oligonucleotides were individually used as primers under optimized conditions. Seventeen of these primers produced polymorphic RAPDs among the 18 accessions of Ae. geniculata. Polymorphisms were recorded by noting presence or absence of an amplification product from the total genomic DNA. Comparisons of unique and shared amplification products of each pair of accessions were used to generate genetic similarity coefficients (GSCs). These GSCs were used to construct a phenogram using an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetical averages (UPGMA). The phenogram shows that RAPD data is useful in the measurement of genetic variation or similarity within a species. It also indicates that we can select eight or nine accessions of the eighteen accessions to maintain at least 80% genetic variability of the Chinese collection of Ae. geniculata.

AB The aim of this study was to find molecular markers (RAPD and SCAR) for the wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr24. A backcross line, RL 6064, possessing a single resistance gene to leaf rust (Lr24) and its recurrent parent 'Thatcher' were used to find RAPD markers linked to the Lr24 gene. Among 125 RAPD primers tested, only one (OP-H5) detected an additional band in the resistant line RL 6064. The genetic linkage of this molecular marker to Lr24 was tested on a segregating F-2 population derived from a cross between the leaf rust resistant line RL 6064 and the susceptible line 'Chinese Spring'. This marker showed complete linkage to the Lr24 resistance gene. A more reliable and specific marker for this resistance gene was made by converting it into a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR). The presence of a single amplification product allowed direct detection of the gene in the test tube by the addition of ethidium bromide. This SCAR marker linked to the leaf rust resistance gene Lr24 could be used easily in a practical breeding program.

AB A simple monoclonal antibody-based screening test has been developed for the presence of translocations of the short arm of chromosome 2 of rye (2RS) with wheat chromosome 2B. 2RS encodes a set of about three polypeptides known as M(r) 75 000 gamma-secalins. Use of the antibody test for these secalins enabled screening of several hundred seeds per day. The antibody could readily distinguish 2BL-2RS translocations and 2R substitutions from 1BL-1RS translocations or nontranslocation wheats. Use of the antibody in analysis of segregating progeny for Sec-2 in several wheat backgrounds was successful. Results with a selection of the seed population were checked using protein gel electrophoresis, with 100% correct confirmation.

AB Twenty-nine lines with deletions in the Lr19 ('Indis') translocated chromosome segment were used to physically map three Thinopyrum RFLP loci as well as the Sr25 and Sdl loci. From the data, the relative locations of marker loci on the translocation were determined as: Sdl, Xpsr165, Xpsr105, Xpsr129, Lr19, Wsp-D1, Sr25/Y. The data confirmed the reported homoeology between the Lr19 segment and chromosome arm 7DL of wheat. Also, it seems that the Lr19 translocation in 'Indis' is very similar to the Lr19 segment in the T4 source and that the former may not derive from Thinopyrum distichum.

AB Introgression of chromosomal segments across large taxonomic distances has long been an objective of scientists interested in understanding the relationships between genes and their effect on phenotype. Barley and wheat represent cultivated members of the Triticeae with different zones of adaptation, different responses to pathogens, and different end-use characteristics. Introduction of small, well-characterized chromosomal segments among grass relatives presents an opportunity to both better understand how genes perform in novel genomic environments and to learn more about the evolutionary novelties which differentiate related species. Since the distribution of the wheat-barley addition lines, the potential power and value of a comprehensive series of wheat/barley translocation lines has been widely appreciated. A scarcity of easy-to-use markers which unambiguously distinguish barley loci from their wheat homologues has limited the ability of scientists to identify the relatively rare inter-chromosomal recombination events which are the necessary antecedents of these lines. Since the single most critical pathogen affecting U.S. wheat producers is Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) and since barley carries a gene conferring immunity, molecular markers may prove practically and immediately important. In this report we describe a series of 135 barley-specific markers amplified by 115 primer sets developed from sequences from previously mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. These easily distinguish the cognate barley products from their wheat counterparts and should find ready use in the identification of lines which contain wheat/barley translocation events.

AB Fertile transgenic barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants of five cultivars were obtained by an improved transformation protocol using different particle delivery devices. Varieties of barley which are hardly amenable for genetic transformation due to low tissue culture response were stably transformed by optimizing transformation parameters for each genotype separately according to their tissue culture response. Scutella of immature-zygotic embryos were transformed with the plasmid pAHC25 carrying the selectable marker gene bar and the reporter gene uidA. Gene delivery was optimized using the uidA-expression as transient marker for the transformation efficiency and taking into account the maintenance of the regeneration capacity after the bombardment. After selection on media with bialaphos as selective agent, 40 independently transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for functional expression of the bar and uidA gene. Molecular analysis by Southern hybridization confirmed the integration of both genes into the nuclear genome of the plants. Thirty-five T-0-plants of five barley cultivars reached maturity so far. Analysis of the progeny confirmed the inheritance of the marker genes.

AB Research was conducted to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with dehydration tolerance and osmotic adjustment of rice. Osmotic adjustment capacity and lethal osmotic potential were determined for 52 recombinant inbred lines grown in a controlled environment under conditions of a slowly developed stress. The lines were from a cross between an Indica cultivar, Co39, of lowland adaptation and a Japonica cultivar, Moroberekan, a traditional upland cultivar. The QTL analysis was conducted using single marker analysis (ANOVA) and interval analysis (Mapmaker/QTL). The measurements obtained and the QTL identified were compared to root traits and leaf rolling scores measured on the same lines.
   One major locus was associated with osmotic adjustment. The putative locus for osmotic adjustment may be homoeologous with a single recessive gene previously identified for the same trait in wheat. The putative osmotic adjustment locus and two of the five QTL associated with dehydration tolerance were close to chromosomal regions associated with root morphology, In this population, osmotic adjustment and dehydration tolerance were negatively associated with root morphological characters associated with drought avoidance. High osmotic adjustment and dehydration tolerance were associated with Co39 alleles and extensive root systems were associated with Moroberekan alleles. To combine high osmotic adjustment with extensive root systems, the linkage between these traits will need to be broken. Alternatively, if the target environment is a lowland environment with only brief water deficit periods, selection for drought tolerance characteristics without consideration of the root system may be most appropriate.

AB Marker-based selection of Ep-D1b has been used successfully to incorporate Pch1, the gene for eyespot resistance on chromosome 7D, into commercial wheat. However, attempts to transfer resistance conferred by Pch2 (on chromosome 7A) through selection for Ep-Alb have not always been successful. Linkage relations among eyespot resistance gene Pch2, a gene encoding for an isozyme of endopeptidase, Ep-A1b, and RFLP marker Xpsr121 on chromosome 7A were determined using 80 homozygous recombinant substitution lines. The recombinant lines were derived from eyespot susceptible 'Chinese Spring' hybridized with a resistant disomic substitution line of 'Cappelle Desprez' that has chromosome 7A substituted into 'Chinese Spring'. Segregations of Pch2, Ep-A1b and Xpsr121 fit an expected 1:1 single-locus ratios based on chi(2) tests. Linkage analysis revealed that Pch2 was not tightly linked to Ep-A1b (15% recombination). However, close linkage (3.8% recombination) existed between Ep-A1b and Xpsr121. The order of these loci is Pch2-Xpsr121-Ep-A1b. Unlike Pch1 and Ep-D1b, where little or no recombination is found, Pch2 and Ep-A1b showed considerable recombination and therefore linkage cannot be utilized efficiently in marker-based selection.

AB A highly efficient method for stable wheat transformation using hygromycin resistance as a selectable marker is described. Young embryogenic calli growing from immature wheat embryos were transformed using a gunpowder-driven microparticle accelerator. Transgenic wheat plants were determined by PCR amplification of transgene fragments and confirmed by Southern hybridization, activity of the transgene expression and by analysis of the progeny. The hpt gene was as good as or a better selectable marker than the bar gene with an average efficiency (number of transgenic plants relative to the number of bombarded calli) of 5.5% compared with 2.6% for the bar gene.

AB A molecular-marker linkage map of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) provides a powerful tool for genomic regions influencing breadmaking quality. A variance analysis for kernel hardness was conducted using 114 recombinant inbred lines (F-7) from a cross between a synthetic and a cultivated wheat. The major gene involved in kernel hardness, hn (hard), known to be on chromosome arm 5DS, was found to be closely linked with the locus Xmta9 corresponding to the ene of puroindoline-a. This locus explained around 63% of the phenotypic variability but there was no evidence that puroindoline-a is the product of Hn (soft). Four additional regions located on chromosomes 2A, 2D, 5B, and 6D were shown to have single-factor effects on hardness, while three others situated on chromosomes 5A, 6D and 7A had interaction effects, Positive alleles were contributed by both parents. A three-marker model explains about 75% of the variation for this trait.

AB Diversity and relationships among ten tetraploid wheat landrace populations, collected from different localities in the central highlands of Ethiopia, were studied using isozyme markers and agronomic traits. This type of analysis in crop species is fundamental for designing optimal germ plasm collection, management practices and for developing an index for parental selection, The populations differed in allelic frequencies. Gene-diversity estimates showed that the populations encompass an appreciate amount of variation. However, differentiation between them was low, as was also confirmed by the presence of gene flow. Much of the diversity (85%), was attributable to the within-population level. The genetic distances were mostly small with the exception of those between a few pairs of populations. Thus, the relationships discerned among the populations were more of a similarity nature which could be ascribed to sharing a common ancestral population and/or adaptation to similar climatic conditions, The pattern of genetic divergence appeared to be independent of geographic distance. Considerable divergence in the agronomic traits was observed for certain populations. Cluster analyses of the isozyme and agronomic data produced different patterns and memberships of groupings. This lack of agreement could be ascribed to the different forces of evolution acting on isozyme markers and agronomic baits since agronomic traits, are the prime target of artificial selection. The clustering based on agronomic traits resulted in grouping together populations with similar agronomic performance. The results of this study suggest that taking more samples within a locality or population would be a better approach to capture the range of variation in the landrace populations of the central highlands of Ethiopia.

The clone Tag605 was partially sequenced and the FCR primer set AWP1 was designed. The 292-bp product, which showed no polymorphism between varieties, was cloned and sequenced. A single base difference was found in the sequence of the AWP1 products amplified and cloned from the wheat lines AUS10894 and 'Spear'. PCR primers were designed with 3' termini that corresponded to the two alleles. A dual-PCR system was developed in which the primer sets AWP2 and AWP3 produced allele-specific amplification. The concentration of the oligonucleotide primers and the sequence of the primer-template mismatches were critical to the success of discriminatory allele amplification.

AB A transformation system for hexaploid wheat was developed by using scutellar tissues of cultured immature embryos via particle bombardment. The scutellar tissues of immature embryos were cultured for 1 to 9 d prior to bombardment with two plasmids, pBI221 or pAct1-F containing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and pARK22 containing the bialaphos resistant gene (bar). Transient expression of the reporter GUS gene was not influenced by culture duration prior to transformation. On the other hand, transgenic wheat plants of both spring and winter cultivars were obtained from immature embryos bombarded after culture for more than 5 d, but not from those receiving less than 5 d. The integration and inheritance of the bar gene as a selectable marker gene were confirmed by the combination of PCR amplification and Southern analysis of T-0 and T-1 plants. Some of the bialaphos resistant plants showed the expression of the GUS gene co-transformed with the bar gene.

AB Genetic variation was assessed among cultivated and wild hop, Humulus lupulus, by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA). Two rDNA length variants of 10.3 and 9.3 kbp represented by three phenotypes designated A, B and C were detected with XhoI. Restriction-site mapping showed that hop rDNA is structurally similar to those of most higher plants. A high level of homogeneity existed in rDNA repeat lengths among the diverse hop genotypes. Generally, phenotype A was predominant in wild and cultivated European and Asian genotypes; phenotype B in North American cultivars; while phenotype C was present only in native North American hop, providing a potential molecular marker for the identification of this germ plasm. The rDNA data provided genetic evidence for the separation of native and cultivated American genotypes and supports the hypothesis that North American hop cultivars are of hybrid origin from European and native American genotypes. The segregation of rDNA phenotypes in four F-1 families suggests that a single locus with two co-dominant alleles controls genetic variability for rDNA variants in hop.

ID GERM PLASM; SEQUENCE; HYBRIDIZATION; GENOME
AB Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), vectored by the wheat curl mite (Acer tulipae), is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the North American Great Plains. Resistant varieties have not been developed for two primary reasons. First, useful sources of resistance have not been available, and second, field screening for virus resistance is laborious and beyond the scope of most breeding programs. The first problem may have been overcome by the development of resistance to both the mite and the virus by the introgression of resistance genes from wild relatives of wheat. To help address the second problem, we have developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers linked to the WSMV resistance gene Wsm1. Wsm1 is contained on a translocated segment from Agropyron intermedium. One sequence-tagged-site (STS) primer set (WG232) and one RAPD marker were found to be linked to the translocation containing Wsm1, The diagnostic RAPD band was cloned and sequenced to allow the design of specific PCR primers. The PCR primers should be useful for transferring Wsm1 into locally adapted cultivars.

AB More than 20% of the world's agricultural land may contain acid soil. Aluminum toxicity becomes a serious growth limiting factor in many plant species when the soil pH is lower than 5.5. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes differ widely in tolerance to excess Al, and breeding of more tolerant genotypes is a priority in many affected regions. Our objectives were to confirm the number of genes for Al tolerance and determine their chromosomal arm location in the Brazilian wheat cv. BH 1146 and to identify DNA markers linked to Al tolerance gene(s). A population of recombinant inbred lines, developed by single-seed descent from the cross of BH 1146 x 'Anahuac', was screened for Al tolerance with two methods in hydroponic nutrient solution. Both methods showed a bimodal distribution for Al tolerance, consistent with single gene inheritance. Eighty-three low-copy DNA clones were used to screen for polymorphism between the parents. Clone bcd1230 detected a restriction fragment that is located 1.1 centiMorgans from this gene on Chromosome 4DL and explained 85% of the phenotypic variation in Al tolerance. We propose the symbol Alt(BH) to designate the major gene for Al tolerance located on 4DL. This RFLP marker can aid the transfer of this gene into sensitive germplasms.

AB An RFLP map was constructed from 99 doubled haploid lines of a cross between two spring barley varieties (Blenheim x Kym) and used to map quantative trait loci (QTL) controlling ear emergence time and plant height using a marker-regression approach. Three QTL affecting plant height were identified. The largest effect was from the dense dwarfing gene, present in Blenheim, on chromosome 3(3H)L. Two other effects were found, one on 7(5H)L and one on 1(7H)L. The denso gene also had a major effect on ear emergence time. However, eight additional QTL for ear emergence were also identified. Two of these were in regions previously identified as carrying the Sh and Sh2 vernalization response genes, suggesting that allelic variation at these genes may affect ear emergence time in spring barley crosses. Comparisons with maps of related species show conservation and collinearity of markers and genes.

AB Molecular markers have been identified in cultivated oat for the Pg9 and Pg13 loci conferring resistance to different races of the stem rust pathogen, Puccinia graminis f. sp. avenae. Near-isogenic lines and bulked segregant analysis were used to identify putative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. Linkage relationships were established in segregating populations derived from crosses of OT328 with Dumont (segregating for both Pg9 and Pg13), Rodney 0 with Rodney 0-Pg9 (segregating for Pg9), and Rodney 0 with Rodney 0-Pg13 (segregating for Pg13). The 5 markers linked to Pg9 exhibited from 0 to 2.7% recombination with the resistance locus, and the 11 markers linked to Pg13 exhibited from 0 to 22.7% recombination. An oat avenin clone detected a RFLP marker linked to the Pg9 locus and an oat globulin clone detected a RFLP marker linked to the Pg13 locus. Comparative mapping with an existing molecular linkage map of cultivated oat permitted localization of the Pg9 and Pg13 stem rust resistance genes. This is the first report of the localization of stem rust resistance genes on the linkage map of cultivated oat.

AB Germin gene expression is induced in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves by powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) infection. Germin is a protein marker for early cereal development and is an oxalate oxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxalate to CO2 and H2O2. The induction of germin gene expression by powdery mildew infection is consistent with the importance of H2O2 to plant defense and identifies a mechanism for the elevation of H2O2 levels in wheat leaves. Germin mRNA levels increased 2 d after inoculation of seedlings with powdery mildew and continued to increase throughout an 8-d time course. The increase in accumulation of germin mRNA was accompanied by an increase in the germin oligomer, which reached maximal levels by d 6. An increase in oxalate oxidase activity paralleled germin oligomer accumulation. Germin gene expression was induced in a relatively resistant cultivar (Bobwhite) as well as in a susceptible cultivar (Cheyenne), suggesting that the induction of germin gene expression is an indicator of powdery mildew infection rather than cultivar resistance.

AB Three new major, race-specific, resistance genes to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei) were identified in three barley lines, 'RS42-6*O', 'RS137-28*E', and 'HSY-78*A', derived from crosses with wild barley (Hordeum vulgare sap. spontaneum). The resistance gene origining from wild barley in line 'RS42-6*O', showed a recessive mode of inheritance, whereas the other wild barley genes were (semi)-dominant. RFLP mapping of these three genes was performed in segregating F-2 populations. The recessive gene in line 'RS42-6*O', was localized on barley chromosome 1S (7HS), while the (semi)-dominant genes in lines 'RS137-28*E', and 'HSY-78*A'. were localized on chromosomes 1L (7HL) and 7L (5HL), respectively. Closely linked RFLP clones mapped at distances between 2.6 cM and 5.3 cM. Hitherto, specific loci for powdery mildew resistance in barley had not been located on these chromosomes. Furthermore, tests for linkage to the unlocalized resistance gene Mlp revealed free segregation. Therefore, these genes represent new loci and new designations are suggested: mlt ('RS42-6*O'), Mlf ('RS137-28*E'), and Mlf ('HSY-78*A'). Comparisons with mapped QTLs for mildew resistance were made and are discussed in the context of homoeology among the genomes of barley (H-vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and rye (Secale cereale). Duplications of RFLP bands detected in the neighbourhood of Mlf and mlt might indicate an evolutionary interrelationship to the Mla locus for mildew resistance.

AB In cereals, interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations (wide crosses) which yield karyotypically stable hybrid plants have been used as starting points to widen the genetic base of a crop and to construct stocks for genetic analysis. Also, uniparental genome elimination in karyotypically unstable hybrids has been utilized for cereal haploid production. We have crossed hexaploid oat (2n=6x=42, Avena sativa L.) and maize (2n=2x=20, Zea mays L.) and recovered 90 progenies through embryo rescue. Fifty-two plants (58%) produced from oatxmaize hybridization were oat haploids (2n=3x=21) following maize chromosome elimination. Twenty-eight plants (31%) were found to be stable partial hybrids with 1-4 maize chromosomes in addition to a haploid set of 21 oat chromosomes (2n=21+1 to 2n=21+4). Ten of the ninety plants produced were found to be apparent chromosomal chimeras, where some tissues in a given plant contained maize chromosomes while other tissues did not, or else different tissues contained a different number of maize chromosomes. DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were used to identify the maize chromosome(s) present in the various oat-maize progenies. Maize chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were detected in partial hybrids and chromosomal chimeras. Maize chromosomes 1 and 10 were not detected in the plants analyzed to-date. Furthermore, partial self-fertility, which is common in oat haploids, was also observed in some oat-maize hybrids. Upon selfing, partial hybrids with one or two maize chromosomes showed nearly complete transmission of the maize chromosome to give self-fertile maize-chromosome-addition oat plants. Fertile lines were recovered that contained an added maize chromosome or chromosome pair representing six of the ten maize chromosomes, Four independently derived disomic maize chromosome addition lines contained chromosome 4, one line carried chromosome 7, two lines had chromosome 9, one had chromosome 2, and one had chromosome 3. One maize chromosome-8 monosomic addition line was also identified. We also identified a double disomic addition line containing both maize chromosomes 4 and 7. This constitutes the first report of the production of karyotypically stable partial hybrids involving highly unrelated species from two subfamilies of the Gramineae (Pooideae - oat, and Panicoideae - maize) and the subsequent recovery of fertile oat-maize chromosome addition lines. These represent novel material for gene/marker mapping, maize chromosome manipulation, the study of maize gene expression in oat, and the transfer of maize DNA, genes, or active transposons to oat.

AB Genetic diversity and patterns of geographic variation among collections of Paspalum scrobiculatum (kodo millet) and P. polystachyum were studied using molecular markers generated through the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method. A high level of polymorphism in RAPD markers was observed among the individual accessions, demonstrating the high genetic diversity of the crop. The markers obtained from the RAPD method were analyzed with the cluster analysis, principal coordinates and minimum spanning tree methods. Three major groups were resolved, one representing the African accessions, and two for the Indian accessions. The accessions of the north African kodo miller and P. polystachyum (considered conspecific with P. scrobiculatum) were quite distinct. The Australian kodo miller showed higher affinity to the African types. The study demonstrated that the RAPD technique can be applied to resolving degrees and patterns of genetic variation at the population and species levels, identifying cultivars, and defining gene pools of this crop.

AB The distribution of genes and recombination in the wheat genome was studied by comparing physical maps with the genetic linkage maps. The physical maps were generated by mapping 80 DNA and two phenotypic markers on an array of 65 deletion lines for homoeologous group 5 chromosomes. The genetic maps were constructed for chromosome 5B in wheat and 5D in Triticum tauschii. No marker mapped in the proximal 20% chromosome region surrounding the centromere. More than 60% of the long arm markers were present in three major clusters that physically encompassed <18% of the arm. Because 48% of the markers were cDNA clones and the distributions of the CDNA and genomic clones were similar, the marker distribution may represent the distribution of genes. The gene clusters were identified and allocated to very small chromosome regions because of a higher number of deletions in their surrounding regions. The recombination was suppressed in the centromeric regions and mainly occurred in the gene-rich regions. The bp/cM estimates varied from 118 kb for gene-rich regions to 22 Mb for gene-poor regions. The wheat genes present in these clusters are, therefore, amenable to molecular manipulations parallel to the plants with smaller genomes like rice.

ID HESSIAN FLY; RESISTANCE
AB A 2RL.2BS wheat-rye translocation, present in the wheat germplasm line Hamlet, carries a gene for resistance to Hessian fly biotype L, one of the most virulent biotypes presently encountered in wheat production environments. Unlike several other wheat-rye chromosome translocations common in wheat breeding programs, 2RL lacks genes encoding storage proteins or other easily selected markers. Oligonucleotide primers synthesized from published sequences derived from the R173 family of moderately repetitive rye DNA were used in the DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify specific markers for 2RL. The same primers, when used with DNA extracted from additional wheat-rye translocation lines of importance to the wheat breeding community, gave distinctive PCR products for each genotype. The single primer pair, PAWS5 and PAWS6, may, therefore, have wide applicability for the identification of wheat-rye chromosomal translocations presently encountered in wheat breeding populations.

AB A GUS-transformed strain of B. sorokiniana was used to study the relationship between fungal growth, lesion development and natural root cortical cell death (RCD) in roots of different cereals. Roots of 10-day-old seedlings, grown on filter paper, were inoculated with the fungus and at different time intervals lesion size and GUS-activity in the roots were determined. A significant, positive correlation was found between GUS-activity and ergosterol content in barley roots infected with this transformed strain and these results indicate that GUS can be used as a marker to study fungal growth in plant tissue. The fungus had a slower growth rate in resistant barley varieties, i.e., those producing smaller lesions, than in more susceptible varieties.
   In wheat and triticale, the fungal growth was faster than in barley, despite the smaller and lighter coloured lesions in these species. This may be explained by the fact that wheat and triticale have a faster rate of root cortical senescence than barley. Presumably, dying cortex cells cannot respond to the fungal invasion by producing phenolic compounds that cause browning of the tissue. Among seven investigated cereal species, there was a positive correlation between the degree of RCD and fungal biomass increase in roots after inoculation.

AB An F-2 population was established for mapping the two dominant genes for dwarfness (Ddw1) and hairy peduncle (Hp) on chromosome 5R. The location of both genes was shown to be on the segment of chrome some 5RL which was ancestrally translocated and is homoeologous to Triticeae 4L. Hp co-segregated with the wheat gDNA probe WG199, localised in wheat on chromosomes 5AL, 4BL and 4DL. No segregation was observed between the traits hairy peduncle and hairy leaf sheath. The locus for Ddw1 was found to map distally to Hp/Xwg199 but proximal to the isozyme marker beta-amy-R1. The genetical distances were 5.6 cM between Hp/Xwg199 and Ddw1 and 11.5 cM between Ddw1 and beta-amy-R1, respectively. The map position of Ddw1 suggests that it is homoeologous to the wheat dominant dwarfing gene Rht12, present on chromosome 5AL and linked to beta-amy-A1.

AB On the basis of gene frequency data of three flavone glycosylating genes, populations of the agricultural weed Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) in Europe can be divided into two chemical races: an eastern and a western race. Morphological data also show a clear east-west division. When the two datasets are combined at least nine different geographical races can be distinguished using cluster analysis. Because these observations are hard to explain by selection, it has been proposed that these different races probably originated as a consequence of migration during the spread of agriculture over Europe in the past. To discriminate between selection and genetic drift many more selectively neutral easy-to-score characters are needed. In order to test whether random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) might be suitable for this purpose, we performed a small-scale RAPD analysis on 16 geographical different populations. Using Jaccard's coefficient of similarity, we calculated genetic distances by pair-wise comparisons of both unique and shared amplification products, and a dendrogram was subsequently constructed using an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetical averages (UPGMA). On the basis of the dendrogram two clusters were discerned that clearly coincide with the aforementioned east-west division in populations. As there has been little or no artificial selection on this weed, its migration routes may be a good reflection of the different geographical routes agriculture has taken. We propose that a phylogenetic analysis of RAPD data of many more populations may provide additional information on the spread of agriculture over Europe.

AB We have used in vitro cultures initiated from immature zygotic embryos of the monocot Triticum aestivum, variety Chinese Spring, to investigate some features of the transcriptional regulation of the Em gene. A 210-bp cDNA fragment internal to the coding region of the Em gene was amplified by PCR, cloned and used as a probe in northern analyses. Em gene expression was found to be associated with cultures displaying an embryogenic potential and, more precisely, with the presence of somatic embryos. The time-course of Em gene expression was thereafter monitored, by PCR and northern analysis, from the initiation of cultures until the appearance of embryogenic structures and was shown to be temporally regulated during the somatic embryogenesis process. Finally, the Fm protein was observed in both somatic embryos and embryogenic cultures whereas it was not detected in non-embryogenic cultures. Our results, obtained from a monocot, ask the question of whether Em gene expression could be used as a universal late marker of somatic embryogenesis.

AB The dominant gen H9 in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., confers resistance to all known biotypes of Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say). Resistance is expressed as larval antibiosis (death of 1st instars). We isolated from a Washington (WA) population of Hessian files a virulent biotype capable of surviving on and stunting H9 wheat plants, and we established a genetic basis for the virulence. Analysis of F-1 and testcross progenies of reciprocal matings between the virulent WA biotype and avirulent Great Plains biotype indicated that the virulence trait is controlled by a single, completely recessive, sex-linked gene, which we designated a vH9. The inheritance pattern of virulence was consistent with previous genetic evidence that males are hemizygous and express only maternally derived sex chromosomes in their soma. Segregation analysis of the virulence locus with 2 sex-linked marker genes, white eye (w) and Isocitrate dehyrogenase (Idh), showed that vH9 assorts independently of Idh but is linked to w with 39.9 +/- 3.54% recombination. The results suggest that vH9 and eye color loci are located on 1 of the 2 sex chromosomes of the Hessian fly, and the Idh locus is on the other.

With Nirenberg's system, it was possible to identify most isolates as P. herpotrichoides var. herpotrichoides or P. herpotrichoides var. acuformis. However, identification was slow and sometimes inconclusive as overlap occurred between the two varieties for all criteria examined. Molecular markers identified two distinct types among the isolates tested and generally good correlation was found between the PCR-based assay and Nirenberg's system, but the molecular assay was more accurate and faster.

AB jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis [Link] Schneider) is a crop of high economic interest that is grown for the exceptional quality of its seed oil. We have taken advantage of the large variation commonly shown by ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in many plant species to assess the genetic diversity between clones and among individuals in jojoba. The variation of rDNA was analyzed with the use of a homologous 1.7-kbp probe generated by PCR and a 20-mer oligonucleotide probe targeting, respectively, the 17S and 25S coding regions. The multiple-step ladder obtained with the BamH I-EcoR I restriction fragment containing the intergenic spacer (IGS) was the best indicator of variation in length of rDNA unit. In addition to variations observed among selected clones, significant differences in the relative proportion of length variants were seen among individuals grown from seeds of unknown origin.

AB Previous research indicates that infection by the tan spot fungus (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) produces two genetically distinct symptoms in wheat (Triticum aestivum): tan necrosis and extensive chlorosis. Necrosis-inducing isolates of P. tritici-repentis release a host-selective toxin in culture that produces a reaction highly associated with the induction of tan necrosis in susceptible wheat genotypes. The objectives of this research were to determine the number of genes conditioning insensitivity to a necrosis-inducing culture filtrate in a population of wheat F-3 families, and to map the insensitivity gene(s) using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). The population consisted of 58 F-3 families derived from the cross of a resistant synthetic hexaploid, W-7976, with the susceptible cultivar 'Kulm.' At least 16 individuals from each F-3 family were infiltrated with culture filtrate from the P. tritici-repentis isolate 86-124 and were scored as insensitive or sensitive. Low-copy DNA clones that hybridized to group 5 wheat chromosomes were used to detect RFLPs associated with insensitivity. The families segregated in a ratio of 15:29:14 homozygous insensitive/segregating/homozygous sensitive, suggesting that a single nuclear gene was responsible for conditioning insensitivity to the pathogenic factor(s) in the culture filtrate. RFLPs were detected that flanked the locus conferring insensitivity at distances of 5.7 and 16.5 cM. Aneuploid analysis indicated that this gene resided on the long arm of chromosome 5B. We proposed the symbol tsn1 to designate this gene.

AB Variation at the 18S + 26S and 5S ribosomal DNA loci was assessed on 62 Erianthus Michx. clones, representing 11 species, and 15 clones from two Saccharum L. species used as a reference. Genus-specific markers for Erianthus Michx. sect. Ripidium Henrard (Old World species) were identified. Ribosomal DNA units in Erianthus sect. Ripidium exhibited an additional BamHI site compared to Saccharum, and 5S units showed length and restriction-site differences between Erianthus and Saccharum. These markers will be useful to follow introgression in Saccharum x Erianthus hybrids. Six ribosomal units (for 18 + 26S genes) were revealed in Erianthus sect. Ripidium, differing by restriction-site positions and/or length. These results provided new information on species relationships and evolution within the genus Erianthus. The Indonesian and Indian forms of E. arundinaceus (Retz.) Jeswiet gave different restriction patterns, which were similar to those of E. bengalense (Retz.) R. C. Bharadwaja and E. procerus (Roxb.) Raizade, respectively. The two 2n = 20 species, E. ele-phantinus Hook.f. and E. ravennae (L.) P. Beauv., could also be differentiated at this locus. Two of the New World Erianthus species studied, E. rufipilus (Steud.) Griseb. and E. longisetosus Andersson, appeared more like Erianthus sect. Ripidium, whereas E. trinii Hack. and E. brevibardis Michx. showed patterns consistent with Miscanthus sinensis Andersson and S. spontaneum L., respectively. Finally, the comparison of rDNA restriction maps among Erianthus sect. Ripidium, Saccharum, sorghum and maize, led to unexpected conclusions concerning the relationships between the different genera and the position of Erianthus in the ''Saccharum complex''.

AB Members of the (1 --> 3)-beta-glucan glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39) gene family have been mapped on the barley genome using three doubled haploid populations and seven wheat-barley addition lines. Specific probes or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were generated for the seven barley (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanase genes for which cDNA or genomic clones are currently available. The seven genes are all located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3HL), and genes encoding isoenzymes GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV and GVII (ABG2) are clustered in a region less than 20 cM in length. The region is flanked by the RFLP marker MWG2099 on the proximal side and the Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus (BYMV) resistance gene ym4 at the distal end, The gene encoding isoenzyme GVI lies approximately 50 cM outside tills cluster, towards the centromere. With the exception of the gene encoding isoenzyme GIV, all of the (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanase genes are represented by single copies on the barley genome. The probe for the isoenzyme GIV gene hybridized with four DNA bands during Southern blot analysis, only one of which could be incorporated into the consensus linkage map.

AB Barley yellow dwarfluteovirus (BYDV) causes serious yield losses in all cereals worldwide. The Yd2 gene from a number of Ethiopian barleys (Hordeum vulgare L.) has been the most effective means of providing resistance against BYDV in cultivated barley. Isolation of the Yd2 gene will enable characterisation of the molecular basis of the Yd2-BYDV interaction. This paper describes the first stage in a project to isolate the gene: the construction of a detailed linkage map of the Yd2 region. The map encompasses 27.6 centiMorgans (cM) of chromosome 3 and contains 19 RFLPs, 2 morpholog,ical marker loci, the centromere and Yd2. In the mapping population of 106 F-2, individuals, Yd2 perfectly cosegregated with the RFLP loci Xwg889 and XYlp, which were located on the long arm, 0.5 cM from the centromere. The two morphological marker loci, uzu dwarf and white stripe,,j, both mapped distal to Yd2. The protein product of the gene at the XYlp locus will provide a convenient assay for the selection of Yd2 during the breeding of BYDV-resistant barley varieties.

AB Sets of substitution lines have advantages over segregating populations for the rigorous analysis of loci influencing quantitative traits. A general strategy for the rapid production of substitution lines was developed. It involved the systematic application of marker-assisted selection over 2-4 generations of backcrossing. The effectiveness of this strategy was demonstrated by the production of intervarietal substitution lines in Brassica napus. A genetic map containing 158 loci, distributed across all 19 B. napus linkage groups and assayed in 200 B-1 individuals, was generated. Six complementary B-1 individuals enriched for recurrent genotype and collectively carrying almost all the donor genome were selected. A total of 288 B-2 plants derived from the selected B-1 individuals were analysed and complementary individuals carrying five or fewer donor segments were identified. Similar selection, carried out on 250 B-3 plants from two distinct B-1 lineages, identified 74 B-3 individuals carrying one or two donor segments. Together, 12 of these isolated segments represented 33% of the mapped genome. Lines homozygous for single substituted segments were derived from selfed progeny of selected B-3 plants. A full set of substitution lines will be used to elucidate the genetic control of quantitative production traits in oilseed rape over several environments.

AB Comparative genetic mapping of rice and barley, both major crop species with extensive genetic resources, offers the possibility of uniting two well-established and characterized genetic systems. In the present study, we screened 229 molecular markers and utilized 110 polymorphic orthologous loci to construct comparative maps of the rice and barley genomes. While extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including inversions and intrachromosomal translocations, differentiate the rice and barley genomes, several syntenous chromosomes are evident. Indeed, several chromosomes and chromosome arms appear to share nearly identical gene content and gene order. Seventeen regions of conserved organization were detected, spanning 287 cM (24%) and 321 cM (31%) of the rice and barley genomes, respectively. The results also indicate that most (72%) of the single-copy sequences in barley are also single copy in rice, suggesting that the large barley genome arose by unequal crossing over and amplification of repetitive DNA sequences and not by the duplication of single-copy sequences. Combining these results with those previously reported for comparative analyses of rice and wheat identified nine putatively syntenous chromosomes among barley, wheat and rice. The high degree of gene-order conservation as detected by comparative mapping has astonishing implications for interpreting genetic information among species and for elucidating chromosome evolution and speciation.

AB An important determinant of wheat grain quality is the hardness of the grain. The trait is controlled by a major locus, Ha, on the short arm of chromosome 5D, Purified starch granules from soft-grained wheats have associated with them 15-kDa polypeptides called grain softness proteins (GSPs) or ''friabilins.'' Genes that encode one family of closely related GSP polypeptides - GSP-1 genes - were mapped using chromosome substitution lines to the group 5 chromosomes, An F-2 population segregating for hard and soft alleles at the Ha locus on a near-isogenic background was used in a single-seed study of the inheritance of grain softness and of GSP-1 alleles, Grain softness versus grain hardness was inherited in a 3:1 ratio. The presence versus absence of GSPs in single seed starch preparations was coinherited with grain softness versus hardness, This showed that grain softness is primarily determined by seed, and not by maternal, genotype, in addition, no recombination was detected in 44 F-2 plants between GSP-1 restriction fragment length polymorphisms and Ha alleles, Differences between hard and soft wheat grains in membrane structure and lipid extractability have been described and, of the three characterized proteins that are part of the mixture of 15-kDa polypeptides called GSPs, at least two, and probably all three, are proteins that bind polar lipids, The data are interpreted to suggest that the Ha locus may encode one or more members of a large family of lipid-binding proteins.

AB A molecular method for the detection of Paenibacillus azotofixans in soil and the wheat rhizosphere was developed. The system consisted of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of part of the variable V1 to V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, followed by hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe homologous to part of the intervening region. In vitro specificity tests showed that the detection system worked specifically for P. azotofixans strains, and did not detect other Paenibacillus species or species of other bacterial genera. Vegetative cells of a rifampicin resistant P. azotofixans derivative were trackable in Flevo silt loam (FSL) soil in 24 h experiments using both selective plating and most probable number (MPN)-PCR combined with probing, and plate counts parallelled MPN-PCR estimations of numbers of specific targets. MPN-PCR allowed for the detection of down to 10(2) introduced cells per g of dry soil. Introduced P. azotofixans spores did not form colonies on selective plates, but were detectable via PCR. The P. azotofixans populations introduced into the silt loam soil suffered a slow decline of the detectable plate count over a period of 14 days. MPN-PCR revealed a similar decline of the number of specific DNA targets. Greater numbers of targets were found in wheat rhizosphere from Flevo silt loam soil, and these numbers persisted throughout the experiment. Soil drying resulted in enhanced persistence of the target sequences, whereas in a constantly moist soil the numbers of target sequences declined. Rewetting of dried soil resulted in declining target sequence numbers. The MPN-PCR detection method is adequate to assess the impact of stress conditions affecting P. azotofixans in FSL and probably other soils, since it abolishes the need for culturing or specific markers and is direct and unambiguous due to its high specificity.

AB A method for polyethyleneglycol (PEG) mediated direct DNA transfer into protoplasts was successfully established for transient and stable transformation of Triticum aestivum L. cell cultures. Transgenic cell lines, which had been transformed with the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (nptII) fused to different promoters, were selected and integration and expression of the marker gene was shown by Southern analysis and enzyme activity test. For investigation of expression stability, five nptII positive cell lines maintained under selection were protoplasted and clonal callus lines were cultivated from the genetically identical single cells without selection pressure. Marker gene activity of 271 clonal callus lines was determined and compared with the corresponding parental line. A reduction or loss of marker gene expression in up to 50% of the clonal cell lines was observed. Detailed analysis of randomly selected clones showed that the observed variability in marker gene expression occurred due to a reduction in the nptII transcript level and was associated with hypermethylation of the integrated DNA. The silencing effect was reversible by a 4 week culture phase on media supplemented with the demethylation agent 5-azacytidin. These differences in marker gene expression could be observed regardless of copy number and position of the integrated nptII gene. The significance of such observations for a stable expression of foreign genes in plant cells is discussed.

AB The Bt-10 bunt gene confers resistance to most races of the common bunt fungi, Tilletia tritici and T. laevis. The RAPD technique, employing a total of 965 decamer primers, was used to identify polymorphic markers between resistant (BW553) and susceptible ('Neepawa') near-isogenic lines. Primer 196 (5' CTC CTC CCC C 3') produced a 590 base pair (bp) reproducible fragment only in the resistant near-isogenic line. The 590-bp DNA fragment was present in all the 22 wheat cultivars known to carry the Bt-10 resistance gene and also in 15 resistant F-2 lines obtained from a cross between the resistant parent, BW553, and the susceptible parent, 'Neepawa'. The 590-bp fragment was absent in 16 susceptible cultivars tested and in 15 susceptible F-2 lines obtained from the cross described above. These results suggest a close linkage between the presence of the 590-bp fragment and the Bt-10 resistance gene. Primer 372 (5' CCC ACT GAC G 3') amplified a 1.0-kilobase (kb) fragment that was present only in the susceptible near-isogenic line. This 1.0-kb fragment was present in 13 of the 16 susceptible cultivars and in 13 of the 15 susceptible F-2 lines. However, the primer also amplified the 1.0-kb fragment in some resistant cultivars and resistant F, lines, suggesting a looser linkage between the occurrence of the fragment and the susceptible allele.

AB The colinearity of markers linked with resistance loci on linkage group A of diploid oat, on the homoeologous groups in hexaploid oat, on barley chromosome 1H, and on homoeologous maize chromosomes was determined. Thirty-two DNA probes from homoeologous group 1 chromosomes of the Gramineae were tested. Most of the heterologous probes detected polymorphisms that mapped to linkage group A of diploid oat, two linkage groups of hexaploid oat, barley chromosome 1H, and maize chromosomes 3, 6, and 8. Many of these DNA markers appeared to have conserved linkage relationships with resistance and prolamin loci in Avena, Hordeum, and Zea mays. These resistance loci included the Pea crown rust resistance cluster in diploid oat, the R203 crown rust resistance locus in hexaploid oat, the MIa powdery mildew resistance cluster in barley, and the rp3, wsm1, wsm2, mdm1, ht2, and htn1 resistance loci in maize. Prolamin encoding loci included Ayn in diploid oat and Hor1 and Hor2 in barley. A high degree of colinearity was revealed among the common RFLP markers on the small chromosome fragments among these homoeologous groups.

AB A new powdery mildew resistance gene designated Pm21, from Haynaldia villosa, a relative of wheat, has been identified and incorporated into wheat through an alien translocation line. Cytogenetic and biochemical analyses showed that chromosome arms 6VS and 6AL were involved in this translocation. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed on recipient wheat cultivar Yangmai 5, the translocation line, and H. villosa with 180 random primers. Eight of the 180 primers amplified polymorphic DNA in the translocation line, and the same results were obtained in four replications. Furthermore, RAPD analysis was reported for substitution line 6V, seven addition lines (1V-7V), and the F-1, as well as F-2 plants of (translocation line X 'Yangmai 5'), using two of the eight random primers. One RAPD marker, specific to chromosome arm 6VS, OPH17-1900, could be used as a molecular marker for the detection of gene Pm21 in breeding materials with powdery mildew resistance introduced from H. villosa.

AB We describe a molecular cytogenetic procedure for high resolution physical mapping of DNA markers, an essential seep toward construction of an integrated molecular-classical-cytological map. Tomato was selected as material because its pachytene chromosomes are amenable for study and because detailed molecular, classical, and cytological maps are available. Karyotyping of acetocarmine-stained pachytene chromosomes showing detailed cytogenetic landmarks was combined with direct FISH of the 5S rDNA gene. This enabled us to pinpoint the 5S rDNA gene to the first heterochromatic knob immediately adjacent to the centromere in the short arm of chromosome 1. Thus the position of the 5S rDNA gene on the molecular map was related to the position of the 5S rDNA on the cytogenetic map. The results also provide conclusive evidence of the location of a functional gene in the pericentric heterochromatic region, a rare event to date in plants. We conclude that karyotyping of pachytene chromosomes can be combined with FISH to map a DNA sequence to a cytogenetically defined region and to determine the chromatin origin of an expressed gene.

AB To understand the molecular mechanisms of erythroid differentiation, we analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR the expression of the transcription factor GATA1, the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and erythroid (beta-globin) differentiation markers in purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) after in-vitro-induced differentiation. Whether GATA1 transcription was from the proximal (with respect to the AUG, also known as erythroid) or the distal (also known as testis) promoter was analyzed as well. Low-density marrow cells which bind to wheat germ agglutinin, but not to the antibody 15.1.1, and which either do or do not retain the dye rhodamine-123 (Rho-bright and Rho-dull, respectively), were purified. Rho-dull, but not Rho-bright, cells permanently reconstitute lymphomyelopoiesis in W/W-V and severe-combined-immunodeficiency mice and, therefore, contain HSCs. Both Rho-dull and Rho-bright cells give rise to progenitor and differentiated cells (peak values at days 15 and 5, respectively) in liquid culture. Multilineage, erythroid-restricted or myeloid-restricted differentiation is observed when the cultures are stimulated with stem cell factor (SCF) + interleukin (IL)-3, SCF + IL-3 + Epo, or SCF + IL-3 + granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, respectively. Rho-dull cells have barely detectable reconstitution potential at day 5 of culture. None of the genes examined were expressed in purified Rho-bright or Rho-dull cells. The only exception was GATA1 which was expressed at maximal levels in Rho-bright cells at the onset of culture. Rho-dull cells did not express GATA1 before day 3 of culture (maximal expression at days 10-15). Activation of GATA1 and EpoR was observed in all growth factor combinations. There was a significant correlation between the amount of mRNA for the two genes expressed by the cells. In contrast, beta-globin mRNA was detected only in the presence of Epo. The transcription of GATA1 was exclusively from the proximal promoter in the absence of Epo but both proximal and distal transcripts were observed in its presence. Maximum transcription from the distal promoter (approximately equal to 0.2% of total GATA1 mRNA) coincided with maximal globin mRNA levels (day 5 or day 15 for Rho-bright and Rho-dull cells, respectively). These results indicate that GATA1 is activated at the transition point between HSCs and pluripotent progenitor cells and erythroid-specific GATA1 regulation involves activation of the distal GATA1 promoter.

AB We have studied the possibility of developing lines with the alien substitution of chromosome 5R from the rye cultivar Onokhoyskaya for its homoeologues 5A or 5D of various cultivars of common wheat recognized by the manifestation of the Hp marker gene. The scheme suggested is based on using the Hp gene as a phenotypic marker for isolation of 42-chromosome plants with the genotype 20 '' W+I'W+5R' for weak pubescence of culm. Analysis of gamete transmission frequency in the reciprocal hybrids BCl with the chromosomal constitution 20 '' W+5A'+5R' showed that the frequency of transmission of gametes 20+5R is higher through the male parent than through the female (37.8% and 17.8%, respectively), and that of gametes 21+5R is practically identical through either (7.7% and 8.4%, respectively). Following our method, we have developed nine lines with chromosome 5R substituted for 5A, one line with 5RL(5A) and monosomic alien substitution lines and addition lines with rye chromosome 5R in various recipient cultivars.

AB The major aim of this experiment was to compare the effectivness of RFLP probes and RAPD primers in evaluating genetic diversity and separating different groups of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). For this purpose. five barley varieties were chosen to represent different groups based on growth habit and head type. They were tested parallel with 12 RFLP probes in five enzyme combinations and with 19 RAPD primers. The number of DNA products and the frequency of the polymorphic bands generated by RAPD primers were higher than those obtained with the RFLP probes. The value of the polymorphic bands averaged over all the variety x primer or all the variety x probe x enzyme combinations was 3.50 for the RAPD primers and 0.82 for the RFLP probes. On the other hand RFLP was mom informative as there was much lower variation in the estimations of genetic diversity using the individual RFLP probes than using the individual RAPD primers. There was a definite distinction between the different groups of barley with RFLP. while only the variety with two-rowed heads was separated from the others with RAPD. The correlation between the JD genetic diversity values generated by the two methods was r(2)=0.69. Based on the results. RFLP probes appear more efficient in establishing a reliable grouping of relatedness between varieties, while RAPD primers are more effective than the RFLP probes in giving a good characterisation of individual varieties and breeding materials.

AB Genetic adaptation implies the shaping of population and species gene pools In response to environmental challenges. The two components of the abiotic land environment are climate and soil, both of which determine much of the evolutionary adaptedness of plants as, besides representing a set of surrounding physical, chemical and sometimes limiting traits, they determine the availability of nutrients and energy, of which they are the immediate source. Ecogeographical distribution of species and ecotypes and different physiological mechanisms and developmental patterns are good evidence of plant adaptedness to soil and climate. However, it is not always easy to determine the underlying genetics of adaptive processes, because 1) environmental factors to which the plants are responding are not always evident and are sometimes too complex, 2) several genes may be involved in the response to a given environmental factor, and 3) the same gene/s may be involved in different adaptive responses. In particular, data on Avena species and temperature as a key environmental factor will be used to illustrate some examples of climatic and edaphic adaptedness. Temperature affects the genetic evolution and geographical distribution of all organisms, and a great deal of evidence indicates that species and populations are genetically adapted to different temperature regimes. Isozymes and other molecular markers have helped in the understanding of the genetic basis of adaptedness. There are many examples of correlation between isozyme and DNA-marker variation and environmental differences. For many population geneticists, isozyme markers are just genetic markers with little or no direct involvement in adaptation. However, metabolic processes are controlled by enzymes, influenced by the environment and used to react in response to it. Evidence that isozymes, and perhaps other molecular polymorphisms, are directly involved in adaptedness will be also presented. Molecular genetic analyses at gene and population levels are opening the ways to a better understanding of plant genetic adaptation.

AB The results of genetic studies of common wheat that have been conducted in Novosibirsk, Russia, over the past 20 years by a research team are summarized. The research strategy was to develop a collection of aneuploids and substitution lines to be further used for chromosomal localization of genes and in the study of the genetic variability of wheat. On the basis of two cultivars, namely Saratovskaya 29 and Diamant, we have developed 6 sets of aneuploids with a complete set of monosomic lines for each, plus sets of lines ditelosomic and monotelosomic for ''standard'' arms. Exploiting the monotelosomics, 108 single chromosome intervarietal substitutions, 13 lines with alien substitutions (mono- and disomics) and 11 addition lines have been developed. A collection of lines isogenic for dominant marker genes of morphological characters has also been developed. The genetic collection was used in chromosomal localization of 15 genes, for many of which chromosome arms have been determined. Positively or negatively, the question of allelism within some loci has been answered.

AB The advent of molecular marker systems has made it possible to develop comparative genetic maps of the genomes of related species in the Triticeae. These maps are being applied to locate and evaluate allelic and homoeoallelic variation for major genes and quantitative trait loci within wheat, and to establish the pleiotropic effects of genes. Additionally, the known locations of genes in related species can direct searches for homoeologous variation in wheat and thus facilitate the identification of new genes. Examples of such analyses include the validation of the effects of Vm1 on chromosome 5A on flowering time in different crosses within wheat; the indication of pleiotropic effects for stress responses by the Fr1 locus on chromosome 5A; the detection of homoeologous variation for protein content on the homoeologous Group 5 chromosomes; and the detection of a new photoperiod response gene Ppd-H1 in barley from homoeology with Ppd2 of wheat.

AB The historical development of cytogenetic research in cereals performed at the Plant Breeding Institute of the Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg from its beginning in 1935 until 1992 is reviewed with special reference to polyploidy, alien introgression and aneuploidy.
   Th. Roemer founded 1935 in the framework of his Institute a Department of Mutation Research which, in 1937, was extended to a Department of Cytogenetics with R. Freisleben as the first head. Research highlights of this period were the introduction of mutation breeding, the development of autotetraploids in barley and linseed, the discovery of the crossability genes in wheat and the performance of wheat-rye crosses.
   The main objective in the period between 1950-1960 was the analysis of the relationships between chromosome behaviour and seed set in tetraploid rye and octoploid triticale.
   Since 1961 the Cytogenetics Research Group was headed by D. Mettin; he was followed by W.D. Bluthner in 1983. The research activities in this period concerning aneuploidy in rye and wheat and alien introgression are being reviewed under the following headings: Cytogenetics of rye; work with wheat aneuploids; contributions to the 1R introgression into wheat; alien introgressions into wheat to improve disease resistance and grain quality; the exploitation of molecular markers.

AB Cytological tester sets include series of aneuploids (nullisomics, monosomics, trisomics of different types, tetrasomics), series of rearranged chromosomes (translocations, inversions, duplications, deficiencies) and series of chromosomes recognizable by specific microscopically visible markers (C- or other banding, molecular markers). In rye, only a few (mainly tertiary and telocentric) monosomics and no viable nullisomics have been found. Several sets of primary trisomics and some telocentric sets, usually not fully complete, have been developed, but few are still available for gene localization. A few tertiary trisomics have been derived from translocation heterozygotes. Extensively used are different sets of additions of rye chromosomes to wheat. A relatively widely distributed set of marked chromosomes is the Wageningen translocation tester set, complemented with translocations from different other institutions. A disadvantage of rye translocations is insufficient heterozygote semisterility. Series of otherwise rearranged chromosomes have not been reported. Sets of lines with chromosomes conspicuously differing from the standard C-banding pattern have been obtained. Molecular markers are available for most rye chromosome, but lack of heterozygosity, necessary for classification after in situ hybridization is a restriction for use as cytological testers. In the cases of most translocations, C-banding and in situ molecular markers, each separate plant in a segregating population must be screened cytologically, whereas with aneuploid markers or with translocations having sufficient heterozygote semisterility, analyzing segregations is sufficient.

Leaf sections of maize and wheat plants are placed on an indicator medium containing chlorophenol red and the selection agent. Changes in the color of the medium from red to yellow resulting from altered pH indicate transformed plants within 2-5 d. The method is particularly suited to use with phosphinothricin and could be used with other suitable selectable markers.

AB Three principal approaches are used in our laboratory to analyze plant genomes: (i) The construction of high density molecular maps using a refined microdissection procedure to construct chromosomal and subchromosomal libraries. (ii) Synteny analysis: The Aegilops-based deletion mapping system in wheat that has led to the construction of a high-density physical consensus map of wheat. The integration of wheat, barley and oat RFLP markers has proven the colinearity between the wheat A-, B- and D-genomes, the H-genome of barley, and the E-genome of Agropyron. (iii) Gene mapping in situ, and chromosomes at high resolution: Sensitivity enhancement of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and an efficient preparation of plant chromosomes has been developed. A tandemly amplified repetitive sequence element from microdissected barley chromosomes has enabled the karyotyping of individual Gramineae genomes in a single step. These sequences are also useful for double or triple hybridization-experiments. The low copy genes for the: storage proteins Sec-1 and Hor-B have been topographically mapped on the satellite of chromosome 1R of rye and the syntenic locus on barley chromosome 1H.

AB Analyses, based on the structure of the rDNA region, were developed to examine the possibility of identifying and typing some of the most important Tuber spp at both the symbiotic and non-symbiotic levels. Internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using specific primer pairs on genomic DNAs, isolated from ascocarps and ectomycorrhizae of various Tuber spp and from rootlets of uninoculated host plants. The variability in the lengths of ITS amplification products of DNA isolated from fruit bodies allowed a primary discrimination of the Tuber spp considered. At the ectomycorrhizal level the same species showed a pattern which was the combination of those typical of Tuber plus the host plants. Southern analyses, performed using the ITS product of Tuber brumale as a probe, confirmed the previous results: each fungus species showed a specific pattern, as well as each Tuber-host plant combination. It is concluded that molecular markers from the rDNA region can be used to differentiate Tuber spp and that the method proposed could be used to check and certify mycorrhizally infected plants.

AB The lack of alternative selectable markers in crop transformation has been a substantial barrier for commercial application of agricultural biotechnology. We have developed an efficient selection system for wheat transformation using, glyphosate-tolerant CP4 and GOX genes as a selectable marker. Immature embryos of the wheat cultivar Bobwhite were bombarded with two separate plasmids harboring the CP4/GOX and GUS genes. After a 1 week delay, the bombarded embryos were transferred to a selection medium containing 2 mM glyphosate. Embryo-derived calli were subcultured onto the same selection medium every 3 weeks consecutively for 9-12 weeks, and were then regenerated and rooted on selection media with lower glyphosate concentrations. Transgenic plants tolerant to glyphosate were recovered. ELISA assay confirmed expression of the CP4 and GOX genes in R(0) plants. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the transgenes were integrated into the wheat genomes and transmitted to the following generation. The use of CP4 and GOX genes as a selectable marker provides an efficient, effective, anti alternative transformation selection system for wheat.

AB Linkage of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers with a single dominant gene for resistance to black root rot (Chalara elegans Nag Raj and Kendrick; Syn. Thielaviopsis basicola [Berk. and Broome] Ferraris) of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), which was transferred from N. debneyi Domin, was investigated in this study. There were 2594 repeatable RAPD fragments generated by 441 primers on DNAs of 'Delgold' tobacco, a BC5F8 near isogenic line (NIL) carrying the resistance gene in a 'Delgold' background, and 'PB19', the donor parent of the resistance gene. Only 7 of these primers produced eight RAPD markers polymorphic between 'Delgold' and 'PB19', indicating there are few RAPD polymorphisms between them despite relatively dissimilar pedigrees. Five of the eight RAPD markers were not polymorphic between 'Delgold' and the NIL. All of these markers proved to be unlinked with the resistance gene in F-2 linkage tests. Of the remaining three RAPD markers polymorphic between 'Delgold' and the NIL, two were shown to be strongly linked with the resistance gene; one in coupling and the other in repulsion. Application of the two RAPDs in the elimination of linkage drag associated with the N. debneyi resistance gene and marker-assisted selection for the breeding of new tobacco cultivars with the resistance gene is discussed.

AB Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmal., a wild, diploid ancestor of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has become an important genetic resource for wheat improvement. As this trend continues, a detailed understanding of the introgression process becomes increasingly important. This study utilized molecular markers to track introgression of T. tauschii DNA into common wheat. Genotypes of 147 BC2F1 lines derived from crosses between wheat and T. tauschii were determined for one protein, 25 restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and eight random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. MAPMAKER and GMENDEL computer programs were used to determine Linkage groups and genetic distances. Map orders and recombination distances of linked probes compared favorably with the existing T. tauschii map except for chromosome 4D, which was inherited as a unit. Certain chromosomal segments from either T. aestivum or T. tauschii were transferred more frequently than expected, and choice of recurrent parent played a role in the level of introgression that occurred. Recombination between the D genomes of T. aestivum and T. tauschii occurs at a level similar to that in an intraspecific cross; any abnormalities that exist should not hinder the ability to transfer genes of interest while eliminating Banking chromatin that may be responsible for deleterious effects.

AB Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. has become a commonly used genetic resource for wheat improvement. Although genes controlling qualitative traits such as disease and insect resistances are generally targeted in germplasm development programs, genes for quantitative traits may be introgressed along with the target genes. This study was designed to identify genomic regions associated with quantitative traits from hexaploid/diploid wheat crosses. One hundred forty-seven BC2F1-derived families from crosses between elite common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines and T. tauschii were evaluated for yield, kernel weight, protein concentration, and kernel hardness in held experiments at two locations during 2 yr. Genotypes of these families were determined by testing with one protein, 25 restriction fragment length polymorphism probes, and eight random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Two RAPD markers were associated with consistent effects on grain yield. Three markers were associated with kernel weight, accounting for 16% of the variance among families. In addition, two loci associated with protein concentration and one locus associated with kernel hardness were identified, accounting for 29 and 9% of the variance among families for the respective traits. In most instances, quantitative trait Loci had relatively small effects, and regression analysis of agronomic performance on proportion of marker alleles from T. tauschii showed that the majority of linked chromatin from the diploid species had no detectable effect on any trait. Based on these results and previous studies, T. tauschii can be considered a primary source of resistance genes for wheat improvement.

AB The differential display technique was originally developed for the isolation of differentially expressed genes from eukaryotic tissues. We have adapted this technique for the isolation of cDNA markers from specific regions of the tomato genome. For this purpose, differential display was performed on RNA extracted from leaf tissue of nearly isogenic lines for the Tm-2a gene of tomato. On average, one out of 20 primer combinations resulted in a polymorphism at the cDNA level. When used as hybridization probes, all of these cDNA fragments were single or low copy and all of them were polymorphic on Southern hybridizations using DNA from the isogenic lines. Genetic mapping revealed in each case at least one locus in the introgressed segment on chromosome 9 of tomato. Thus, this technique might provide a way for the direct isolation of transcribed sequences from specific regions of any animal or plant genome for which such lines exist.

AB In a study to optimize the use of the bar gene as a selectable marker gene in plant transformation, the selection mechanism of phosphinothricin in vitro was studied. It was found that tissues with a high anabolic activity were more sensitive to the toxicity of ammonium than tissues with a low anabolic activity. However, tissues with a low anabolic and high catabolic activity were more sensitive to glutamine deprivation. The metabolic (anabolic and catabolic) activity of callusing hypocotyl explants of Brassica napus L. was influenced by the carbon source of the medium and the light condition. The expression of the bar gene regulated by the light-inducible promoter derived from the gene coding for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase was also influenced by both light condition and carbon source. Finally, a bioassay to screen for, and to quantify the resistance of explants to, phosphinothricin is presented.

Subcloning and sequencing of a 1.4-kb segment of this clone allowed us to design PCR amplification primers to isolate homologous mtDNA segments of about 0.9 kb from 23 representative genotypes of Hevea. Complete sequences from 4 genotypes showed between 6.7% and 20.2% of nucleotide diversity, suggesting the presence of a hypervariable, or hotspot, region. A sequence of 345 nucleotides within this region was determined for the 23 genotypes. The phylogenetic relationships inferred from the sequence comparison are in general agreement with the results obtained from mtDNA RFLP analysis, indicating that this polymorphic mtDNA region is a useful molecular marker for phylogenetic analysis within Hevea.

AB The ribosomal DNA repeat units of two closely related species of the genus Fraxinus, F. excelsior and F. oxyphylla, were characterized. The physical maps were constructed from DNA digested with BamHI, EcoRI, EcoRV and SacI, and hybridized with three heterologous probes. The presence or the absence of an EcoRV restriction site in the 18s RNA gene characterizes two ribosomal DNA unit types found in both species and which coexist in all individuals. A third unit type appeared unique to all individuals of F. oxyphylla. It carries an EcoRI site in the intergenic spacer. Each type of unit displayed length variations. The rDNA unit length of F. excelsior and F. oxyphylla was determined with EcoRV restriction. It varied between 11kb and 14.5 kb in F. excelsior and between 11.8 kb to 13.8 kb in F. oxyphylla. Using SacI restriction, at least ten spacer length variants were observed in F. excelsior, for which a detailed analysis was conducted. Each individual carries 2-4 length variants which vary by a 0.3-kb step multiple. This length variation was assigned to the intergenic spacer. By using the entire rDNA unit of flax as probe in combination with EcoRI restriction, each species can be unambiguously discriminated. The species-specific banding pattern was used to compare trees from a zone of sympatry between the two species. In some cases, a conflicting classification was obtained from morphological analysis and the use of the species-specific rDNA polymorphism. Implications for the genetic management of both species are discussed.

AB The introgression of rye DNA into the wheat genome was studied using random decamer and specific primers with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA from paired near-isolines in Chisholm and Arkan backgrounds differing with respect to the presence of a 1 RS.1 BL translocation was amplified with 120 arbitrary sequence primers. Two of the primers (OPR 19 and OPJ07) amplified rye-specific DNA fragments. The OPR19 primer amplified a 1.35-kb fragment that appeared to be specific to the 1 RS.1 BL translocation, based on its presence only in lines carrying the 1 RS. 1 BL translocation. A fragment of the same size was also amplified in 1 RS.1 AL translocation lines. This 1 RS. 1 BL marker locus was designated Ximc 1. The other primer, OPJ07, amplified a 1.2-kb DNA sequence, that was designated Ximc 2, specific to the wheat-rye translocation in various wheat backgrounds. The sequences of the two marker loci were found to be different from each other. The Ximc I locus was a low-copy sequence which was also present in Balboa rye genomic DNA. Through the use of specific primers, the presence of the rye-specific marker was confirmed in hexaploid as well as in tetraploid wheat backgrounds. The use of RAPDs for the study of smaller alien introgressions into wheat is discussed.

AB A molecular-marker linkage map of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) provides a framework for integration with the classical genetic map and a record of the chromosomal rearrangements involved in the evolution of this crop species. We have constructed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) maps of the A-, B-, and D-genome chromosomes of homoeologous groups 4, 5, and 7 of wheat using 114 F-7 lines from a synthetic x cultivated wheat cross and clones from 10 DNA libraries. Chromosomal breakpoints for known ancestral reciprocal translocations involving these chromosomes and for a known pericentric inversion on chromosome 4A were localized by linkage and aneuploid analysis. Known genes mapped include the major vernalization genes Vrn1 and Vrn3 on chromosome arms 5AL and 5DL, the red-coleoptile gene Rc1 on 7AS, and presumptively the leaf-rust (Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici) resistance gene Lr34 on 7DS and the kernel-hardness gene Ha on 5DS. RFLP markers previously obtained for powdery-mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici) resistance genes Pm2 and Pm1 were localized on chromosome arms 5DS and 7AL.

AB The cis-regulatory function of a far-upstream sequence (-1,711 to -186) of the promoter of the wheat gene for histone H3 (TH012) was analyzed in cultured rice and tobacco cells in a transient expression system with the gene for beta-D-glucuronidase as a reporter gene. The far-upstream sequence was necessary for full activity of the H3 promoter in rice cells but did not enhance the activity of the proximal promoter in tobacco cells. Dissection analysis of the far-upstream sequence revealed the existence of several positive and negative cis-acting sequences in this region, some of which functioned differently in rice and tobacco cells. In gain-of-function experiments with rice cells, the sequence from -848 to -704, containing the CCAAT and octamer (CaCGGATC) motifs, functioned in an orientation-independent manner, whereas the sequence from -703 to -486 functioned in an orientation-dependent manner. By contrast, both sequences exhibited an orientation-dependent cis-function in tobacco cells. These findings suggest that some cis-regulatory sequences in the far-upstream region of the H3 promoter function differently in rice and tobacco cells.

AB The objective of this study was to characterize the leaf rust resistance locus Lr1 in wheat. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed on the resistant line Lr/16*Thatcher and the susceptible varieties Thatcher and Frisal, as well as on the segregating F-2 populations. Seventeen out of 37 RFLP probes mapping to group 5 chromosomes showed polymorphism between Lr1/6*Thatcher and Frisal, whereas 11 probes were polymorphic between the near-isogenic lines (NILs) Lr1/6*Thatcher and Thatcher. Three of these probes were linked to the resistance gene in the segregating F-2 populations. One probe (pTAG621) showed very tight linkage to Lr1 and mapped to a single-copy region on chromosome 5D. The map location of pTAG621 at the end of the long arm of chromosome 5D was confirmed by the absence of the band in the nulli-tetrasomic line N5DT5B of Chinese Spring and a set of deletion lines of Chinese Spring lacking the distal part of 5DL. Twenty-seven breeding lines containing the Lr1 resistance gene in different genetic backgrounds showed the same band as Lr1/6*Thatcher when hybridized with pTAG621. The RFLP marker was converted to a sequence-tagged-site marker using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Sequencing of the specific fragment amplified from both NILs revealed point mutations as well as small insertion/deletion events. These were used to design primers that allowed amplification of a specific product only from the resistant line Lr1/6*Thatcher. This STS, specific for the Lr1 resistance gene, will allow efficient selection for the disease resistance gene in wheat breeding programmes. In addition, the identification of a D-genome-specific probe tightly linked to Lr1 should ultimately provide the basis for positional cloning of the gene.

AB The Cl--HCO3- exchanger is the main anionic exchanger (AE) that alleviates alkaline loads in cardiac cells. We recently identified in adult ventricular cells two membrane proteins (80 and 120 kD) immunologically related to the erythroid band 3 and likely to mediate the anion exchange. In the present study, we further investigated the Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity concomitantly with the expression and intracellular localization of the band 3-like proteins during the development of neonatal rat cardiac cells maintained in culture for 17 days. Microspectrofluorometric measurements of pH, in single cells show that neonatal rat cardiomyocytes display a fully functional DIDS-sensitive Cl--HCO3- exchanger at early stages of development. Neither basal pH(i) nor the anion exchange activity changes with different stages of the culture. In Western blotting with an anti-whole erythroid band 3 antibody, we found both the 80- and the 120-kD band 3-like proteins in whole heart and cultured neonatal cardiac cells. The 80-kD protein was also recognized by an anti-AE1 antiserum, whereas the 120-kD protein was specifically detected by an anti-cardiac AE3 antibody. Thus, we propose that the proteins are encoded by two different genes, AE1 and AE3, respectively. Subcellular fractionation of isolated and cultured cardiomyocytes revealed the presence of both proteins in the membrane, nuclear, and myofibril fractions. The results obtained in biochemical experiments corroborate the confocal images of immunostained neonatal cells, which demonstrate perinuclear location of band 3-like proteins at an early stage of development and their appearance within myofilaments after cell maturation. Colocalization of band 3-like proteins with specific markers of the Golgi apparatus, wheat germ agglutinin and CTR433 antibody, suggests the presence of these proteins in the Golgi area. The later decoration of repetitive striations between each sarcomere indicates that the band 3-like proteins are assigned in development within a compartment similar to costameres, areas of attachment of myofibrils to sarcolemma. These areas are likely to play a major role in signal transduction of neurohormonal stimuli.

AB Correspondence among QTLs affecting height and/or flowering was investigated across the five races of sorghum, an interspecific sorghum F-2 population, and 32 previously published sorghum, maize, rice, wheat, and barley populations revealing 185 QTLs or discrete mutants. Among nine QTLs mapped in the interspecific sorghum population (six affecting height and three affecting flowering), at least seven (78%) are associated with ''conversion,'' backcross-introgression of alleles imparting reduced height or earlier flowering from cultivated sorghums into one or more exotic Sorghum bicolor races. One chromosomal region was ''converted'' in all S. bicolor races-in the interspecific F-2, this region explained 54.8% of height variation (putatively the Dw2 gene) and 85.7% of flowering time variation (putatively Ma1). Comparative data suggest that Ma1 and Dw2 orthologs influence height and flowering of other Poaceae taxa and support classical dogma that the sorghum phenotypes attributed to Ma1 and Dw2 (respectively) are due to different genetic loci. Other sorghum QTLs also showed correspondence with those in other Poaceae, more frequently than would be expected by chance. Possible homoeologous QTLs were found within both the maize and sorghum genomes. Comparative QTL mapping provides a means to unify, and thereby simplify, molecular analysis of complex phenotypes.

AB In situ hybridization with biotin-labelled DNA probes was used to determine the physical locationmarkers from an RFLP-based genetic map of homoeologous group 7 in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). The observed results indicated all probes hybridized to the corresponding group 7 chromosomes of all three wheat genomes and that the gene orders on the physical map were basically the same as that of the RFLP-based genetic map. The distance for each marker from the centromere on the physical map was different from those shown on the genetic map. Comparison of the genetic distance and the physical distance between two pairs of markers (Xpsr129 to Xpsr121, and Xpsr129 to Xpsr117) showed that the region between Xpsr129 and Xpsr121 contains a potential 'hot' spot of recombination on the chromosome arm. There appears to be considerable differences in crossing-over along the chromosomes. Most of the polymorphic markers are physically located in the middle portion of the chromosome arm to which they were genetically located, indicating reduced recombination in the centromeric and telomeric regions. Markers on the physical map were located outside the C-banded regions. The translocation break point involving 7BS and a colinear relationship among the homoeologous group 7 chromosomes are discussed.

AB To characterize the celery (Apium graveolens L, var. dulce, 2n = 2x = 22) genome, 126 celery cDNA clones and 340 random 10-mer primers were used to generate restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers between two cultivated types. Different abundance classes of the genomic sequences represented by the cDNA clones and the RAPD markers were observed. Most of the cDNA clones were single-copy sequences, suggesting the true diploid nature of the celery genome. Nearly half of the 39 RAPD markers tested by Southern hybridization were multiple-copy sequences. Of the RAPD markers tested, 28% was single- and low-copy, and 26% was high-copy sequences, The polymorphism level of the cDNA clones was 23 % when tested with four restriction enzymes (EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, and HaeIII), A positive association was observed between RFLP level and the size of cDNA inserts or hybridized restriction fragments. Deletion, insertion, and base substitution were important in the formation of the RFLP markers, Eighty-two (23%) of the 340 primers tested yielded useful RAPD markers, but only 3.8% of the amplified products were polymorphic Base substitution may be the most important mechanism for the RAPD markers in celery, The RAPD fragments revealed no RFLP markers when tested by Southern hybridization, implying that RAPD markers are an important complement to RFLP markers in genomic mapping in celery, Random methylation of cytosine was determined in 5S rDNA on BamHI and HindIII cutting sites that produced ladder patterns characteristic of tandem repeats.

AB Quantitative field resistance of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis DC f, sp. tritici EM) is an important trait that is selected for by plant breeders. Due to the necessary assessment in the field, the estimation of quantitative held resistance is very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the availability of easily scorable markers for this trait would be of great advantage in wheat breeding. In this study, host-responses that can be scored on individual plants at the seedling stage were assessed to see if they could serve as markers for quantitative resistance in the held. The accumulation characteristics of five defence-related gene transcripts and the formation of papillae and cell wall appositions following an infection by powdery mildew were compared in six wheat lines and one spell (triticum spelta L.). The lines represented a broad spectrum of different degrees of quantitative field resistance but carried no effective major resistance gene against powdery mildew. No clear correlation was found between the kinetics of levels of accumulation of defence-related defence-related gene transcripts following infection at the seedling stage and the degree of quantitative field resistance. However, cytological analysis showed that the proportion of adaxial epidermal cells that responded to pathogen attack by the formation of papillae or cell wall appositions appeared to be an indicator of high quantitative field resistance. In lines exhibiting a high quantitative field resistance, more than 80% of attacked adaxial cells responded, while in the more susceptible lines, this value dropped to less than 20%. Thus, the easily scorable proportion of attacked cells that show no cytologically visible host-response may provide a valuable marker to predict the degree of quantitative field resistance.

AB An Aegilops cylindrica chromosome induces terminal deletions of chromosomes in wheat as identified by C-banding. We are constructing high-density physical maps of wheat chromosomes and have detected additional chromosome rearrangements. Among 63 lines with chromosomal subarm deletions in group 7 chromosomes, 7 lines (11.1%) were shown to harbor additional chromosome rearrangements. Two other lines were also omitted from the physical mapping because of the nature of the breakpoint calculations. The presence or absence of chrome some-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers indicated that additional interstitial deletions are present in 3 lines (4.8%) with deletions in the short chromosome arms and in 4 lines (6.3%) with deletions in the long chromosome arms. We also used chromosome pairing analysis of F-1 plants of deletion lines with double ditelosomic lines of 'Chinese Spring' wheat to detect small terminal deletions. The deletion of the most distal 1% of chromosome arm 7AL was associated with a pairing reduction of 60%.

AB Several gene linkage maps have been produced for cultivated barley. We have produced a new linkage map for barley, based on a cross between Hordeum vulgar e subsp, spontaneum and Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare (Hvs x Hvv), having a higher level of polymorphism than most of the previous barley crosses used for RFLP mapping. Of 133 markers mapped in the Hvs x Hvv F-2 population, 69 were previously mapped on other barley maps, and 26 were mapped in rice, maize, or wheat. Two known gene clones were mapped as well as two morphological markers. The distributions of previously mapped markers were compared with their respective barley maps to align the different maps into one consensus map. The distributions of common markers among barley, wheat, rice and maize were also compared, indicating colinear linkage groups among these species.

AB A bioluminescence marker system was used to characterize colonization of the rhizosphere by a bacterial inoculum, both in terms of population activity and at the single-cell level. Plasmid pQF70/44, which contains luxAB genes under the control of a strong constitutive phage promoter, was introduced into the rhizobacterium and model biocontrol agent Enterobacter cloacae. Light output from the lux-modified strain was detected by luminometry of samples from growing cultures of E. cloacae and from inoculated soil and wheat root samples. The minimum detection limits for fully active cells under optimum conditions were 90 and 435 cells g(-1) for liquid culture and soil, respectively. The metabolic activities of the lux-marked population of E. cloacae, characterized by luminometry, contrasted in rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil. Cells in the rhizosphere were active, and there was a linear relationship between light output and cell concentration. The activity of cells in nonrhizosphere soil could not be detected unless the soil was supplied with substrate, Novel use of a charge-coupled device is reported for the spatial characterization of rhizosphere colonization by E. cloacae (pQF70/44) at the single-cell and population levels. Used macroscopically, the charge-coupled device identified differences in colonization due to competition from indigenous soil organisms. The lux-marked bacterium was able to colonize all depths of roots in the absence of competition but was restricted to the spermosphere in the presence of competition (nonsterile soil). The combined use of luminometry, dilution plate counts, and charge-coupled device imaging (macroscopic and microscopic) demonstrates the potential of luminescence-based detection as a powerful system for assessment of rhizosphere colonization by lux-marked microbial inocula.

AB Monoclonal antibody ER-MP12 defines an antigen (Ag) on murine hematopoietic stem cells that is differentially expressed by the various subsets in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. To test whether ER-MP12 could be an asset for further subfractionation of these subsets, we physically sorted our previously defined low-density ER-MP20(-) (i.e., Ly-6C(-)) Rhodamine-123(dull) (Rh123(dull)), and wheat germ agglutinin(dim) (WGA(dim)) Stem cell populations on the basis of ER-MP12 Ag expression. In addition, we determined the distribution of the ER-MP12 Ag on bone marrow 6 days after 5-FU treatment. Long-term and transiently repopulating stem cell subsets were both identified in vitro using the cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay. The data show that sorting on the basis of ER-MP12 improves the separation of primitive and more mature stem cell subsets in the Rh123(dull) but not in the WGA(dim) subpopulation However, the combination of sorting cells on the basis of an intermediate ER-MP12 expression and a low WGA affinity (ER-MP12(medium) WGA(dim)) allows an 840-fold enrichment for in vitro long-term repopulating cells (day-28 CAFC) when compared with unseparated bone marrow. The distribution of the ER-MP12 Ag on 5-FU-treated bone marrow stem cells was similar to that in normal bone marrow stem cells, suggesting that the level of Ag expression is not dependent on cell-cycle status. Together, the combination of ER-MP12 and WGA offers the advantage of a positive selection strategy for hematopoietic stem cells, allowing different stem cell subsets to be distinguished on the basis of their primitiveness. Since no mature bone marrow cells are found within the WGA(dim)ER-MP12(medium) subpopulation, the combination of ER-MP12 and WGA enables hematopoietic stem cells to be highly enriched and thus makes the use of a cocktail of lineage-specific ic antibodies redundant.

AB The nucleolus organizing regions (NORs) on the short arms of chromosomes 1A(m) and 5A(m) of diploid wheat, Triticum monococcum L., are at the most distal loci in the linkage maps of these two chromosome arms. This distal location differs from the interstitial location of the Nor loci on chromosome arms IBS of tetraploid Triticum turgidum L. and hexaploid T. aestivum L., 5DS of T. aestivum and diploid Ae. tauschii Coss., and 5HS of barley. Moreover, the barley 5HS locus is at a different location than the 5DS locus. However, other markers, including the centromeres, are colinear. These findings showed that the major Nor loci have repeatedly changed position in the chromosome arms during the radiation of species in the tribe Triticeae without rearrangements of the linkage groups. It is suggested that Nm loci may change position via dispersion of minor loci, that are shown here to exist in the T, monococcum genome, magnification of gene copy numbers in these minor loci, and subsequent deletion of the original major loci. Implications of these findings for the use of rRNA nucleotide sequences in phylogenetic reconstructions are pointed out.

AB DNA markers distributed over large chromosomal regions exhibit conservation of order (collinearity) in different cereal species, but it is not known whether this is maintained on a finer scale, i.e. less than or equal to 2 cM, To address this, sets of two or more genetically linked DNA markers were localised to yeast artificial chromosomes containing rice DNA inserts. Linkage analysis of these DNA markers in barley revealed complete correspondence with their genetic order in rice, the distance between linked sequences on rice chromosomes being <1.6 cM or less than or equal to 1 x 10(6) bp (1 Mb), Thus, DNA markers separated in this range are collinear in rice, barley and, by inference, other members of the Triticeae, These results are discussed with respect to the use of rice as a key system for the isolation of cereal genes.

AB Mitotic recombination has been postulated by some researchers as a mechanism to explain the lack of segregation for certain traits in plants derived from tissue culture. Three genetic marker lines were used to examine whether mitotic recombination could be detected from plants regenerated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) tissue culture. One line, CI 11014, had two dominant genes An (awned) and Gl (pubescence) in linkage group 12. The other two, CI 11020 and CI 245714, had two corresponding recessive genes nn (awnless) and gl (glabrous). A total of 1788 R(1) plants regenerated from immature panicles of F-1 plants from the crosses Ct 11020 x CI 11014 and CI 245714 x CI 11014, and from the parental lines, were evaluated from 1988 to 1990 in the greenhouse, and 360 R(2) lines derived from these F-1 plants and parental lines were evaluated in the held. No mitotic recombination occurred for the genes investigated in this experiment. A high somaclonal variation frequency (47.5%) for the awnless characteristic was observed. The variation was not due to mutation of the dominant gene An, but was apparently caused by mutation of an inhibitor gene. Results from these experiments suggested that somaclonal variation was not always random and that specific loci had higher mutation rates during the somaculture procedure. Previous suggestions that changes in DNA methylation pattern caused by the tissue culture process were not random were consistent with the data from our studies.

AB Fertility restoration for Triticum timopheevi Zhuk. cytoplasmic male sterility in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is controlled by both major fertility restorer (Rf) genes and modifier genes together with environment effects. Therefore, the breeding of efficient and stable male-fertility restorer lines (R-lines) should be facilitated by marker-assisted selection. This study was conducted to identify restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers for the Rf genes, Rf1 and Rf4 in restorer line R113, and Rf3 and a Rf gene on 5D in cultivar Primepi. Polymorphic markers were mapped in testcross F-1 populations and their association with fertility restoration was analyzed by analysis of variance. Tbe results indicated that Rf4 was linked to Xksug48 located on 6BS in R113, Rf3 was linked to Xbcd249 and Xcdo442 on IBS, and Xcdo786 may be associated with the 5D Rf gene in Primepi. In addition, in R113 two other chromosome regions with fertility restoration-associated loci were detected by CD0786 and H1 on 5AL and CDO1189 on 7BS. A locus on 5DS, detected by BCD1871, showed significant epistatic effect on the expression of Rf genes. In Primepi, a locus on 5AL, detected by Xbcd183 and Xbcd876, had effects similar to Xcdo786. Two loci in 'Qu Xian Early A', identified by Xbcd871 and Xwg1026, may be associated with genes controlling ease of restoration in this male-sterile line (A-line). Except for Xbcd1871 and Xwg1026, the effects of other significant RFLP loci were additive in both populations.

AB During the development of disomic additions of rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosomes to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), two reverse tandem duplications on cheat chromosomes 3D and 4A were isolated. By virtue of their meiotic pairing, the reverse tandem duplications initiated the chromatid type of the breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle. This BFB cycle continued through pollen mitoses and in the early endosperm divisions, but no clear evidence of its presence in embryo mitoses was found. The chromosome type of BFB cycle was initiated by fusion of two broken chromosome ends resulting in a dicentric or a ring chromosome. Chromosome type BFB cycles were detected in embryo mitoses and in root tips, but they did not persist until the next meiosis and were not transmitted to the progeny. Active BFB cycles induced breakage of other wheat chromosomes that resulted in additional reverse tandem duplications and dicentric and ring chromosomes. Four loci, on chromosome arms 2BS, 3DS, 4AL, and most likely on 7DL, were particularly susceptible to breakage. The BFB cycles produced high frequency of variegation for pigmentation of the aleurone layer of kernels and somatic chimeras for a morphological marker. With the exception of low mutation rate, the observed phenomena are consistent with the activity of a Ds-like element. However, it is not clear whether such an element, if indeed present, was of wheat or rye origin.

AB The influence of the location of heterologous DNA in Pseudomonas fluorescens R2f on gene stability, expression and transfer following introduction into soil was studied. Three strains with markers on different genetic elements were used, i.e a selftransmissible plasmid (RP4p), a mobilizable plasmid (pSKTG) and a chromosomally inserted marker gene cassette (KTG). in vitro filter mating experiments showed that the selftransmissible plasmid was transferred with high frequencies (about 10(-2)) and that this plasmid could mobilize pSKTG with similar frequencies. The chromosomally inserted marker cassette could be mobilized by RP4p to a recipient strain with low frequency (10(-8)). In sterile soil, transfer of the chromosome could not be detected in the presence of RP4p. When the 3 strains were introduced into 2 soils of different texture planted with wheat, they showed poor survival in Ede loamy sand and good survival in Flevo silt loam. Moreover, a partial, but significant loss of expression of the gentamycin resistance gene aadB was observed in Ede loamy sand, but not in Flevo silt loam.
   RP4p was found to be transferred from an introduced donor to indigenous bacteria in both non-sterile soils planted with wheat, whereas transconjugants harbouring the mobilizable plasmid pSKTG or the chromosomally inserted marker cassette were not detected when a donor strain lacking an IncP plasmid was used.

AB The geographical distribution of Pm10, Pm11, Pm14, and Pm15 wheat genes for resistance to inappropriate formae speciales of Erysiphe graminis was investigated using gene-for-gene relationships. Pm10 and Pm15 were very common among many indigenous accessions of common wheat collected from various areas in the world. The diversity of genotypes, which consisted of allelic combination at those loci, was high near the center of origin of common wheat and decreased with increasing distance from the center. In Europe, an apparent contrast of predominant genotypes occurred between the south and the north, suggesting that these genes are useful markers for revealing the routes by which common wheat spread in Europe. On a whole, the genes for resistance to inappropriate formae speciales were observed to be widely distributed throughout the world, We suggest that the difference between these genes and the genes for resistance to faces of an appropriate forma specialis may only be in their distribution and that of their corresponding avirulence genes.

AB Molecular markers were used to characterise sugarcane intergeneric hybrids between S. officinarum and E. arundinaceus. Very simple diagnostic tools for hybrid identification among the progeny were derived from isozyme electrophoresis and a sequence-tagged PCR. Two enzyme systems (GOT and MDH B) and PCR amplification revealing spacer-size variation in the 5s-rDNA cluster were found most convenient. Specific characterisation of the two genomic components was possible using RFLP and in situ hybridisation. The strong molecular differentiation between S. officinarum and E. arundinaceus allows the identification of numerous Erianthus-specific RFLP bands in the hybrids. Genomic DNA in situ hybridisation allows for the differentiation of the chromosomes contributed by S. officinarum and E. arundinaceus in chromosome preparations of the hybrids. In situ hybridisation with the 18s-5.8s-25s rDNA probe highlights the basic chromosome numbers in the two parental species. The potential of these techniques to monitor the Erianthus genome during the introgression process is discussed.

AB A targeted mapping strategy using representational difference analysis (RDA) was employed to isolate new restriction fragment length polymorphism probes for the long arm of chromosome 6 in rye (6RL), which carries a gene for resistance to Hessian fly larvae. Fragments from the 6RL arm were specifically isolated using a 'Chinese Spring' (CS) wheat - rye ditelosomic addition line (CSDT6RL) as tester, and CS and (or) CS4R as the driver for the genomic subtraction. Three RDA experiments were performed using BamHI amplicons, two of which were successful in producing low-copy clones. All low-copy clones were confirmed to have originated from 6RL, indicating substantial enrichment for target sequences. Two mapping populations, both of which are derived from a cross between two similar wheat-rye translocation lines, were used to map five RDA probes as well as five wheat probes. One of the populations was prescreened for recombinants by C-banding analysis. Fifteen loci, including seven new RDA markers, were placed on a map oi the distal half of 6RL. The Hessian fly resistance gene was localized by mapping and C-banding analysis to approximately the terminal 1% of the arm. The utility of RDA as a method of targeted mapping in cereals and prospects for map-based cloning of the resistance gene are discussed.

AB A molecular-marker map of bread wheat having many markers in common with other grasses in the Gramineae family is a prerequisite for molecular level genetic studies and breeding in this crop species. We have constructed restriction fragment length polymorphism maps of the A-, B-, and D-genome chromosomes of homoeologous group 2 of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Their) using 114 F-7 lines from a synthetic x bread wheat cross and clones from ii libraries. Chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D comprise 57, 60, and 56 markers and each spans about 200 cM. Comparisons between chromosomes are facilitated by 26 sets of homoeoloci. Genes mapped include a heterologous abscisic acid responsive locus cloned as pBS128, the epidermal waxiness inhibitor W2(1), and two presumed leaf rust and stem rust resistance genes. Anomalies suggesting ancestral rearrangements in chromosome 2B are pointed out and features of wheat group 2 chromosomes that are common to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rice (Oryza spp.), and T. tauschii are discussed.

AB A prerequisite for molecular level genetic studies and breeding in wheat is a molecular marker map derailing its similarities with those of other grass species in the Gramineae family. We have constructed restriction fragment length polymorphism maps of the A-, B-, and D-genome chromosomes of homoeologous group 3 of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) using 114 F-7-8 lines from a synthetic X bread wheat cross. The map consists of 58 markers spanning 230 cM on chromosome 3A. 62 markers spanning 260 cM on 3B, and 10 markers spanning 171 cM on 3D. Thirteen libraries of genomic or cDNA clones from wheat, barley, and T. tauschii, the wheat D genome donor, are represented, facilitating the alignment and comparison of these maps with maps of other grass species. Twenty four clones reveal homoeoloci on two of the three genomes and the associated linkages are largely comparable across genomes. A consensus sequence of orthologous loci in grass species genomes is assembled from this map and from existing maps of the chromosome 3 homoeologs in barley (Hordeum spp.). T. tauschii, and rice (Oryza spp.). It illustrates the close homoeology among the four species and the partial homoeology of wheat chromosome 3 with oat (Avena spp.) chromosome C. Two orthologous red grain color genes, R3 and R1, are mapped on chromosome arms 3BL and 3DL.

AB A genetic map of 92 RFLP loci and two storage protein loci was made using 94 doubled-haploid lines from a cross between the winter barley variety Igri and the spring variety Triumph. The markers were combined with data from two field experiments (one spring sown and one autumn (fall) sown) and a glasshouse experiment to locate a total of 13 genes (five major genes and eight quantitative trait loci (QTL)) controlling flowering time. Two photoperiod response genes were found; Ppd-H1 on chromosome 2(2H)S regulated flowering time under long days, while Ppd-H2 on chromosome 5(1H)L was detected only under short days. In the field experiments Ppd-HI strongly affected flowering time from spring and autumn sowings, while Ppd-H2 was detected only in the autumn sowing. The glasshouse experiment also located two vernalization response genes, probably Sh and Sh(2), on chromosomes 4(4H)L and 7(5H)L, respectively. The vernalization response genes had little effect on flowering time in the field. Variation in flowering time was also affected by nine additional genes, whose effects were nor specifically dependent on photoperiod or vernalization. One was the dense dwarfing gene on chromosome 3(3H)L. The remaining eight were QTLs of smaller effect. One was located on chromosome 2(2H), one on 3(3H), one on 4(4H), one on 7(5H), two on 6(6H), and two on 1(7H). Model fitting showed that the 13 putative genes, and their interactions, could account for ail the observed genetical variation from both spring and autumn sowings, giving a complete model for the control of flowering time in this cross.

AB The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to the wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr24 derived from Agropyron elongatum (3DL/3 Ag translocation). Two near isogenic lines (NILs), 'Arina' and Lr24/7* ''Arina'', were screened for polymorphism at the DNA level with 115 RFLP probes. Twenty-one of these probes map to the homoeologous group 3. In addition, 360 RAPD primers were tested on the NILs. Six RFLP probes showed polymorphism between the NILs, and 11 RAPD primers detected one additional band in the resistant NIL. The genetic linkage of the polymorphic markers with Lr24 was tested on a segregating F-2 population (150 plants) derived from a cross between the leaf rust resistant Lv24/7* ''Arina'' and the susceptible spelt (Triticum spelta) variety 'Oberkulmer'. All 6 RFLP markers were completely linked to Lr24: one was inherited as a codominant marker (PSR1205), one was in coupling phase (PSR1203) and 4 were in repulsion phase (PSR388, PSR904, PSR931, PSR1067) with Lr24. The localization of these probes on chromosome 3D was confirmed by nulli-tetrasomic analysis. Distorted,genotypic segregation was found for the codominant RFLP marker PSR1205. This distortion can be explained by the occurrence of hemizygous plants. One of the 11 RAPD markers (OPJ-09) also showed complete linkage to the Lr24 resistance gene. The polymorphic RAPD fragment was cloned and sequenced. Specific primers were synthesized, and they produced an amplification product only in the resistant plants. This specific marker allows a reliable and rapid screening of a large number of genotypes in practical breeding. Analysis of 6 additional lines containing Lr24 revealed that 3 lines have a smaller chromosomal segment of A. elongatum than lines derived from 'Agent', a commonly used gene donor for the Lr24 resistance gene.

AB We report the results of chromosome maps of wheat homoeologous chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D using 40 RFLP markers and 39 homozygous deletion lines. Deletion breakpoints divide the chromosomes into 45 sub-arm intervals with 32 intervals distinguished by molecular markers. The chromosome maps confirm the homoeology of arms 4AS to 4BL and 4DL, and 4AL to 4BS and 4DS. The chromosome map of 4A reveals novel information concerning the 4AL-5AL-7BS cyclical translocation. The presence of homoeologous group-4 long-arm markers, Xksu C10 and Xpsr 1051, intervening between the translocated 5AL and 7BS chromosome segments in 4AL suggests that the translocation events are more complex than was earlier believed. Chromosome maps confirm a pericentric inversion in Chinese Spring chromosome 4B. The consensus chromosome map is compared to the genetic map of wheat to construct a cytogenetic ladder-map (CLM). The CLM reveals an unequal distribution of recombination along the length of the chromosome arms. Recombination is highest in the distal half, and low in the proximal half, of the chromosome arms.

AB The A genome of the Triticeae is carried by three diploid species and subspecies of the genus Triticum: T. monococcum ssp, monococcum, T. monococcum ssp. boeoticum, and T. urartu, the A-genome donor of bread wheat. These species carry many genes of agronomic interest, including disease resistances, and may also be used for the genetic mapping of the A genome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variability present in a sample of 25 accessions representative of this group using RFLP markers. Twenty probes, consisting of genomic DNA or cDNA from wheat, were used in combination with four restriction enzymes. A high level of polymorphism was found, especially at the interspecific level. Selecting the most informative enzymes appeared to be of great importance in order to obtain a stable structure for the diversity observed with only 20 probes. The results are largely consistent with taxonomy and data relating to geographical origins. The probes were also tested on 14 wheat cutivars. A good correlation coefficient was found for their informative values on wheat cultivars and diploid lines. Whether the group of species studied here would be useful for genetic mapping remains to be determined. Nevertheless, RFLP markers will be useful to follow genes that can possibly be introgressed from these species into cultivated wheat.

AB A population of single chromosome recombinant lines was developed from the cross between a frost-sensitive, vernalization-insensitive substitution line, 'Chinese Spring' (Triticum spelta 5A) and a frost-tolerant, vernalization-sensitive line, 'Chinese Spring' ('Cheyenne' 5A), and used to map the genes Vrn1 and Fr1 controlling vernalization requirement and frost tolerance, respectively, relative to RFLP markers located on this chromosome. The Vrn1 and Fr1 loci were located closely linked on the distal portion of the long arm of 5AL, but contrary to previous observations, recombination between them was found. Three RFLP markers, Xpsr426, Xcdo504 and Xwg644 were tightly linked to both. The location of Vrn1 suggests that it is homoeologous to other spring habit genes in related species, particularly the Sh2 locus on chromosome 7 (5H) of barley and the Sp1 locus on chromosome 5R of rye.

AB Polyploid plants in the genus Tripsacum, a wild relative of maize, reproduce through gametophytic apomixis of the diplosporous type, an asexual mode of reproduction through seed. Moving gene(s) responsible for the apomictic trait into crop plants would open new areas in plant breeding and agriculture. Efforts to transfer apomixis from Tripsacum into maize at CIMMYT resulted in numerous intergeneric F-1 hybrids obtained from various Tripsacum species. A bulk-segregant analysis was carried out to identify molecular markers linked to diplospory in T. dactyloides. This was possible because of numerous genome similarities among related species in the Andropogoneae. On the basis of maize RFLP probes, three restriction fragments co-segregating with diplospory were identified in one maize-Tripsacum dactyloides F-1 population that segregated 1:1 for the mode of reproduction. The markers were also found to be linked in the maize RFLP map, on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 6. These results support a simple inheritance of diplospory in Tripsacum. Manipulation of the mode of reproduction in maize-Tripsacum backcross generations, and implications for the transfer of apomixis into maize, are discussed.

AB Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were used to map male fertility restoring gene that was transferred from chromosome 6U of Aegilops umbellulata Zhuk. to wheat. Segments of chromosome 6U bearing the gene that restore fertility to T. timopheevi Zhuk. male sterile cytoplasm were identified in all four translocation lines by two probes, BCD21 and BCD342. Lines 040-5, 061-1 and 061-4 are T6BL.6BS-6U translocations, while line 2114 is a T6AL.6AS-6U translocation. Line 2114 has a much larger 6U chromosomal segment and lower frequency of transmission of male gametes with the alien segment than the other three lines. The restoring gene carried by the 6U segment in 2114 showed high expressivity and complete penetrance. This restoring gene is designated Rf6. A homoeologous chromosome recombination mechanism is discussed for the alien gene transfer.

AB Backcross populations derived from direct hybrids between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the wild diploid T. tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. have utility for germplasm evaluation, but also can furnish genetic material directly into a germplasm-enhancement program. Three hundred ninety-one BC2F2-derived lines from winter wheat x T. tauschii crosses were selected on the basis of disease resistance and general phenotype from populations undergoing field evaluation to determine whether resistant lines agronomically similar or superior to their recurrent parents could be developed. The selected backcross lines were evaluated for yield and grain-quality traits under light to moderate infection by leaf rust (caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici Rob. ex Desm.) and heavy infection by wheat soilborne mosaic and spindle-streak mosaic viruses at two locations in 1991. Approximately 50% of the lines were selected for further field evaluation at two locations in 1992, and three lines were entered in advanced yield trials in a total of eight environments in 1992 and 1993. At all stages of selection, BC2F2-derived Lines were identified with disease resistance, grain yield, and grain quality superior to those of their recurrent parents. Lines differing from their recurrent parents in grain yield, either positively or negatively, occurred in both the disease-resistant and disease-susceptible classes. In advanced yield trials where leaf rust did not affect grain yield, leaf rust-resistant BC2F2-derived lines yielded similarly to their recurrent parents and to cultivars currently grown commercially over large areas. Despite the wide differences in phenotype between common wheat and T. tauschii, two backcrosses were sufficient to transfer resistance genes while almost the wheat parent's phenotype.

AB The heavy metal lead was administered to Arabidopsis thaliana plants by foliar spray. At a concentration of 14mol m(-3), the lead nitrate suspension induced densely distributed necrotic lesions on A. thaliana leaves. A number of Arabidopsis ecotypes were tested and a differential response to heavy-metal toxicity was noted, The necrosis provoked as a result of the phytotoxic effect of lead had a similar appearance to the necrotic lesions observed in a hypersensitive response of A. thaliana to inoculation with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Lummerzheim et al. 1993, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions 6, 532-544), In addition to this phenotypic resemblance, accumulation of polyphenols and callose depositions observed by microscopic analysis, as well as increases in the activities of the stress-related proteins beta-1,3-glucanases, chitinases and peroxidases, revealed significant similarities in the plant response to the two treatments examined, lead toxicity and bacterial infection, The results allow the establishment of markers for both types of stress.

AB Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance has been transferred to wheat from a group 7 chromosome of Thinopyrum (Agropyron) intermedium. The source of the resistance gene was the L1 disomic addition line, which carries the 7Ai-1 chromosome. The resistance locus is on the long arm of this chromosome. BYDV resistant recombinant lines were identified after three or more generations of selection against a group 7 Th. intermedium short arm marker (red coleoptile) and selection for the presence of BYDV resistance. One recombinant line produced by ph mutant induced homoeologous pairing and 14 recombinant lines induced by cell culture have been identified. Resistance in seven of the cell culture induced recombinants has been inherited via pollen according to Mendelian segregation ratios for up to eight generations. Meiotic analysis of heterozygotes indicates that the alien chromatin in the cell culture induced recombinants is small enough to allow regular meiotic behaviour. The ph-induced recombinant was less regular in meiosis. A probe, pEleAcc2, originally isolated from Th. elongatum and that hybridizes to dispersed repeated DNA sequences, was utilised to detect Th. intermedium chromatin, which confers resistance to BYDV, in wheat backgrounds. Quantification of these hybridization signals indicated that the translocations involved a portion of alien chromatin that was smaller than the complete long arm of 7Ai-1. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis confirmed the loss of the short arm of 7Ai-1 and indicated the retention of segments of the long arm of 7Ai-1. Two 7Ai-1L DNA markers always assorted with the BYDV resistance. A third 7Ai-1L DNA marker was also present in seven of eight recombinants. In all recombinants except TC7, the 7Ai-1L markers replaced the 7DL markers. None of the wheat group 7 markers was missing from TC7. It is concluded that all the resistant lines are the result of recombination with wheat chromosome 7D, except line TC7, which is the result of recombination with an unidentified nongroup 7 chromosome.

AB A gibberellic acid-insensitive dwarfing gene in rye (ct1) was mapped in an F-2 population on chromosome 7R close to the centromere. Two RFLP markers were found, which flank the gene at distances of 1 and 3 cM, respectively. A total of 11 markers were mapped on 7R of which six cluster around the centromere and show segregation distortion in the case of the codominant markers. The ctl gene is closely linked to copies of both alpha-amylase and EmBP, as is the ct2 gene on chromosome 5R. Because of the different chromosomal locations of the GA(3)-insensitive dwarfing genes in rye and wheat it is concluded that these genes are not homoeologous. This is supported by further differences in their phenotypic and genotypic expressions.

AB RFLP markers for the wheat powdery mildew resistance genes Pml and Pm2 were tagged by means of near-isogenic lines. The probe Whs178 is located 3 cM from the Pml gene. For the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm2, two markers were identified. The linkage between the Pm2 resistance locus and one of these two probes was estimated to be 3 cM with a F-2 population. Both markers can be used to detect the presence of the corresponding resistance gene in commercial cultivars. ''Bulked segregant analysis'' was applied to identify linkage disequilibrium librium between the resistance gene Pm18 and the above-mentioned marker, which was linked to this locus at a distance of 4 cM. Furthermore, the RAPD marker OPH-11(1900) (5'-CTTCCGCAGT-3') was selected with pools created from a population segregating for the resistance of 'Trigo BR 34'. The RAPD marker was mapped about 13 cM from this resistance locus.

AB Bulk segregant analysis was used to obtain a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker specific for the rye chromosome arm of the 1BL.1RS translocation, which is common in many high-yielding bread wheat varieties. The RAPD-generated band was cloned and end-sequenced to allow the construction of a pair of oligonucleotide primers that PCR-amplify a DNA sequence only in the presence of rye chromatin. The amplified sequence shares a low level of homology to wheat and barley, as judged by the low strength of hybridization of the sequence to restriction digests of genomic DNA. Genetic analysis showed that the amplified sequence was present on every rye chromosome and not restricted to either the proximal or distal part of the 1RS arm. In situ hybridization studies using the amplified product as probe also showed that the sequence was dispersed throughout the rye genome, but that the copy number was greatly reduced, or the sequence was absent at both the centromere and the major sites of heterochromatin (telomere and nucleolar organizing region). The probe, using both Southern blot and in situ hybridization analyses, hybridized at a low level to wheat chromosomes, and no hybridizing restriction framents ments could be located to individual wheat chromosomes from the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of wheat aneuploids. The disomic addition lines of rye chromosomes to wheat shared a similar RFLP profile to one another. The amplified sequence does not contain the RIS 1 sequence acid therefore represents an as yet undescribed dispersed repetitive sequence. The specificity of the amplification primers is such that they will provide a useful tool for the rapid detection of rye chromatin in a wheat background. Additionally, the relatively low level of cross-hybridization to wheat chromatin should allow the sequence to be used to analyse the organization of rye euchromatin in interphase nuclei of wheat lines carrying chromosomes, chromosome segments or whole genomes derived from rye.

AB Mating studies, and RAPD and RFLP analyses used in connection with phenetic and phylogenetic algorithms, were used to reassess the species identity of 23 putative strains of Coprinus psychromorbidus. The results of the mating studies carried out among some of these strains suggest at least four different species. Statistical analyses based on index of genetic dissimilarity and number of evolutionary steps of RAPD and RFLP data resolved 21 of the 23 putative strains into four distinct groups. We propose that the 23 strains, previously grouped into the single taxon, C. psychromorbidus, belong to four or more different taxa. Advantages of molecular characterization of fungi using the RAPD technique are discussed. RAPD profiles appear to be better suited to molecular analyses oriented toward the characterization and clustering of the low temperature basidiomycetes than are RFLP profiles based on ribosomal DNA genes. Statistical treatment of RAPD data indicated that RAPD profiles, including all major and minor DNA bands, were highly reproducible.

AB The regulation of a barley heat shock gene (Hvhsp17) has been investigated by means of transient expression assays with monocot and dicot protoplast systems. The complete 1700-bp 5' region of Hvhsp17, and the deletions of 600 and 170 bp, respectively, were fused with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (beta-GUS) marker gene, to give the following expression vectors: pHSGUS1 (-1700 pHS/GUS fusion), pHSGD1 (-600 pHS/GUS fusion) and pHSGD2 (-170 pHS/GUS fusion). pHSGUS1 and pHSGD1 contain two heat shock elements (HSEs) located in position -238 and -168, respectively, while pHSGD2 contains only one HSE located near the TATA box. As control expression vector, plasmid pBI221 (Clontech) was used, in which the beta-GUS gene is under the control of the CaMV 35S constitutive promoter. All expression vectors were transfected into protoplasts derived from leaf mesophyll cells of tobacco (dicot) and some cereal species (monocots). beta-GUS activity was determined after a heat shock treatment of 1 h at 40 degrees C. Transient expression assays showed that the promoter of Hvhsp17 was active and regulated by thermal induction only in monocot cell systems, while not expressed in tobacco cells. Analyses performed with the deletion constructs, indicated that thermal activation of beta-GUS was obtained only when both the HSEs were present in the promoter region.

AB Nucleolar activity of 22 samples belonging to nine diploid species of Capsicum was analyzed in somatic metaphases and interphase nuclei. They are: C, chacoense, C. parvifolium, C. frutescens, C. chinense, C. annuum var. annuum, C. baccatum var. pendulum, C. pubescens, all with 2n = 24, and C, mirabile var. mirabile and C. campylopodium with 2n = 26. Silver staining was applied for the first time in Capsicum, providing useful markers for chromosome identification in combination with other banding techniques already employed in the genus. From two to eight AgNORs (silver-stained nucleolus organizing regions) were found in the diploid complement of the taxa studied. Nucleolar organizers are located at secondary constrictions of chromosomes which are conventionally stained or banded (C-banding or fluorochrome banding). Polymorphism of AgNORs and attached satellites often occurs. Nucleoli are usually fused to a variable extent. Number and position of active rDNA loci are variable not only between but also within species and populations. Homologies in position of NORs between species were established. The data obtained are related to previous conclusions on phylogenetic relationships in Capsicum. Possible trends of karyotype evolution concerning nucleolar organizers are discussed, and four NORs in the diploid complement (on chromosome pairs #1 [m] and #12 [st]) are regarded as the plesiomorphic condition.

AB Group 1 chromosomes of the Triticeae tribe have been studied extensively because many important genes have been assigned to them. In this paper, chromosome 1 linkage maps of Triticum aestivum, T. tauschii, and T. monococcum are compared with existing barley and rye maps to develop a consensus map for Triticeae species and thus facilitate the mapping of agronomic genes in this tribe. The consensus map that was developed consists of 14 agronomically important genes, 17 DNA markers that were derived from known-function clones, and 76 DNA markers derived from anonymous clones. There are 12 inconsistencies in the order of markers among seven wheat, four barley, and two rye maps. A comparison of the Triticeae group 1 chromosome consensus map with linkage maps of homoeologous chromosomes in rice indicates that the linkage maps for the long arm and the proximal portion of the short arm of group 1 chromosomes are conserved among these species. Similarly, gene order is conserved between Triticeae chromosome 1 and its homoeologous chromosome in oat. The location of the centromere in rice and oat chromosomes is estimated from its position in homoeologous group 1 chromosomes of Triticeae.

AB Near-isolines carrying four different genes for resistance to leaf rust were used to find linked molecular markers for these genes. Clones used to detect polymorphism were selected on the basis of the reported chromosomal location of the resistance genes. Both Lophopyron-derived resistance genes, Lr19 and Lr24, cosegregated with eight molecular markers assigned to chromosomes 7DL and 3DL, respectively. One clone cosegregated with Lr9 and two closely linked RFLP markers were found for Lr32, mapping at 3.3 +/- 2.6 and 6.9 +/- 3.6 cM from the resistance gene. The Lophopyron-chromatin segment in isolines carrying chromosomes 7E (Lr19) and 3E (Lr24) replaced a large portion of chromosome 7D and the distal portion of chromosome 3D, respectively. Clones assigned to these chromosomes on the basis of aneuploid analysis hybridized to 7E and 3E segments, thus confirming cytological results that these introgressed segments represent homoeologous chromosomes. The linked RFLP markers could be used to identify the resistance genes and generate new combinations in breeding populations, especially in the absence of disease in the environment or when virulence is lacking.

AB The aim of this study was to test whether the null allele Ep-D1c of the endopeptidase Ep-D1 can be used as a marker for the Lr19 leaf rust resistance gene. The frequency of Ep-D1c was determined in 1134 winter wheat, spring wheat and spelt breeding lines and varieties. Only eight lines were found to carry Ep-D1c. Six of these lines originated from crosses with RL6040, the gene donor for Lr19. The other two lines were leaf-rust susceptible in the seedling stage and therefore did not carry Lr19. The genetic distance between Ep-D1c and Lr19 was determined in a reciprocal cross between the lines FAP75184 (Ep-D1c, Lr19) and FAP75106 (Ep-D1a, leaf-rust susceptible in the seedling stage). Out of 840 F-2 seedlings screened, 162 were homozygous for Ep-D1c. From 150 of these F-2 plants, F-3 seedlings were screened for segregation for leaf-rust resistance with isolates avirulent on Lr19. Only one F-2 plant produced susceptible F-3 progeny indicating a recombination event between Ep-D1c and Lr19. From these data, a genetic distance of 0.33 +/- 0.3 3cM between Ep-D1c and Lr19 was calculated. The results show that Ep-D1c is a useful marker for a practical breeding programme allowing the rapid identification of plants homozygous for Lr19.

AB In eukaryotes, tandem arrays of simple-sequence repeat sequences can find applications as highly variable and multi-allelic PCR-based genetic markers. In hexaploid bread wheat, a large-genome inbreeding species with low levels of RFLP, di- and trinucleotide tandem repeats were found in 22 published gene sequences, two of which were converted to PCR-based markers. These were shown to be genome-specific and displayed high levels of variation. These characteristics make them especially suitable for intervarietal breeding applications.

AB Bymoviruses, ie BaYMV, BaMMV, WYMV, WSSMV, OMV and RNMV, cause serious damages to their host-plants, resulting in high yield losses in susceptible crops. Due to their transmission by the soil-borne fungus Polymyxa graminis, chemical measures against these diseases are neither efficient nor acceptable for economical and ecological reasons. Therefore, breeding resistant varieties is an important aim for plant breeding. Besides classical breeding methods completed by the production of DH-lines and marker-facilitated selection procedures, recombinant DNA-techniques may give way to new strategies in breeding for resistance to bymovirus in Poaceae in the near future.

AB The DNA-based markers of molecular genetics were combined with the analytical tools of population genetics to learn about the population biology of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola. DNA-based genetic markers, including restriction fragment length polymorphisms in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, DNA fingerprints, and electrophoretic karyotypes were used in combination to show that the amount and distribution of genetic variation within and among field populations of M. graminicola is similar around the world. Measures of gametic disequilibrium suggested that the sexual stage of reproduction has a more significant impact on the genetic structure of M. graminicola populations than asexual reproduction. A field experiment conducted over a 3-year period showed that populations had a high degree of genetic stability over time. The potential effects of selection were quantified in a cultivar mixture experiment with four wheat cultivars that varied in resistance to M. graminicola. In combination, these experiments demonstrated the utility of selectively neutral genetic markers to elucidate the population genetics of fungi.

AB The classical approach of gene transfer to a given plant species delivers the foreign gene to transformable cells and then puts the effort into generating plants. This approach is very difficult in many important crop plants, including cereals, and the results of regeneration are very genotype-dependent. In contrast, we use regenerable cells and try to transform them. Shoot apical meristems provide a tissue which regenerates in situ a fertile plant for most given genotypes or species. Transformation of meristem cells may lead to transgenic sectors in chimeras. These sectors may contribute to the gametes and, thus, to transgenic offspring, which then should be homohistonts and not sectorial chimeras like their parents. Our model plant for these studies is wheat. Microtargeting is a ballistic approach which is particularly suitable for the controlled delivery of microprojectiles to meristem cells in situ (Sautter et al., 1991). We summarize in this paper our experience with ballistic microtargeting of transgenes to wheat shoot apical meristem cells in situ.

AB An aspect of cereal science that is becoming increasingly important is comparative genetics. Establishment of the relationship between genomes within polyploids, between species within tribes and between species within families will allow not only the integration of genetic maps but also the knowledge acquired of each of the species. Using a set of homoeologous probes, workers found the relationship between the three wheat genomes to be precisely collinear, after taking a few major translocation events into account. Transfer of the wheat map to rye led to the elucidation of similar relationships between the three wheat genomes and that of rye. Genome collinearity, however, extends even beyond tribes. In a comparison of the genomes of wheat, rice and maize, it was shown that despite the separation of these genomes for possibly 50 million years, gene order was still highly conserved. This collinearity between genomes can be exploited in a number of ways.

AB Cytological tester sets include series of aneuploids (nullisomics, monosomics, trisomics of different types, tetrasomics), series of rearranged chromosomes (translocations, inversions, duplications, deficiencies) and series of chromosomes recognizable by specific microscopically visible markers (C- or other banding, molecular markers). In rye, only a few (mainly tertiary and telocentric) monosomics and no viable nullisomics have been found. Several sets of primary trisomics and some telocentric sets, usually not fully complete, have been developed, but few are still available for gene localization. A few tertiary trisomics have been derived from translocation heterozygotes. Extensively used are different sets of additions of rye chromosomes to wheat. A relatively widely distributed set of marked chromosomes is the Wageningen translocation tester set, complemented with translocations from different other institutions. A disadvantage of rye translocations is insufficient heterozygote semisterility. Series of otherwise rearranged chromosomes have not been reported. Sets of lines with chromosomes conspicuously differing from the standard C-banding pattern have been obtained. Molecular markers are available for most rye chromosome, but lack of heterozygosity, necessary for classification after in situ hybridization is a restriction for use as cytological testers. In the cases of most translocations, C-banding and in situ molecular markers, each separate plant in a segregating population must be screened cytologically, whereas with aneuploid markers or with translocations having sufficient heterozygote semisterility, analyzing segregations is sufficient.

AB A consensus linkage map of the barley genome was constructed. The map is based on six doubled haploid and one F-2 population. The mapping data for three of the doubled haploid populations was obtained via the GrainGenes database. To allow merger of the maps, only RFLP markers that produce a single scorable band were included. Although this reduced the available markers by about half, the resultant map contains a total of 587 markers including 87 of known function. As expected, gene order was highly conserved between maps and all but two discrepancies were found in closely linked markers and are likely to result from the small population sizes used for some maps. The consensus map allows the rapid localisation of markers between published maps and should facilitate the selection of markers for high-density mapping in defined regions.

AB Thirty-five isolates of Stagonospora nodorum from barley, wheat, and other hosts were identified as either the barley or wheat biotypes based on cultural characters and host specificity. Identification of the biotypes based on these phenotypic criteria was compared with genetic identification by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Twenty-six probes randomly isolated from genomic DNA of a barley biotype isolate were used in the hybridization to differentiate the barley and wheat biotypes. Eighteen and 17 of the 26 probes detected no variation among 14 isolates of the barley biotype and 13 isolates of the wheat biotype, respectively, and unambiguously differentiated the two biotypes. Genetic distance, an estimate of accumulated number of allele substitutions per locus, is 2.286 between the barley and wheat biotypes. The genetic similarity was very high (>0.82) within each of the two biotypes and was very low (0.12) between the two biotypes. Clustering of the isolates based on individual hybridizing DNA bands correlated with biotype identification based on biological characters. The wheat and barley biotypes were then compared with isolates of Stagonospora avenae f. sp. triticea and an isolate of Stagonospora arenaria by hybridizing with 31 anonymous DNA probes (11 from a wheat biotype, 12 from a barley biotype, and eight from S. a. triticea). Two isolates of S. nodorum of unknown biotype, SN91-X and SN038NY-89, used in a previous study, were considered to be the wheat biotype based on DNA banding patterns. Based on allele frequencies of the 31 RFLP loci, the estimated genetic distance between the barley biotype and the wheat biotype of S. nodorum was as great as between any of the two biotypes and S. a. triticea. Likewise, analysis based on discrete hybridizing bands showed that the barley biotype had a closer relationship with S, a. triticea than with the wheat biotype. Two probes from the barley biotype were specific for the barley biotype and did not detect any DNA bands in the wheat biotype. These barley biotype-specific probes may be used as natural markers for identification of the barley biotype.

AB We cryopreserved whole rice calli (Oryza sativa L cv Taipei 309) to investigate the ability of the surviving cells to regenerate plants and yield protoplasts competent for genetic transformation. Four out of six callus lines cryopreserved after four months in culture contained small sectors able to continue cell division and subsequently regenerate fertile plants. Both cryopreservation efficiency and regeneration ability decreased when using eight month old cultures. High yields of protoplasts were obtained from different cryopreserved callus lines. Protoplasts were transfected with chimeric genes consisting of the maize ubiquitin 1 promoter, first exon and first intron fused to the coding region of either the GUS or BAR marker genes. Levels of transient gene expression from both marker genes were similar to those previously obtained using protoplasts derived from callus that had not been frozen. Stable transformants were selected by their resistance to Bialaphos and could be identified with the pH indicator chlorophenol red. Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of the BAR gene into the rice genome. Therefore, cryopreservation does not affect the ability of rice cells to integrate and express foreign genes.

AB Scutella of immature barley embryos were found to exhibit high activity of endogenous beta-glucuronidase which interferes with the expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase that was transferred into the scutella by biolistic transformation, The amount of intrinsic activity was strongly genotype dependent and could be detected with both the histochemical and fluorimetrical assay. This interfering activity could not be eliminated by performing the assay at pH 7.0 nor using additional methanol in the incubation buffer. Only pretreatment of the bombarded scutella for 60 min at 55 degrees C followed by staining at the same temperature in a modified buffer was found to completely suppress barley-endogenous beta-glucuronidase, In addition to the spots of strong GUS activity, these improved conditions made it possible to observe high numbers of smaller GUS-spots that became visible on the white scutellum, being no longer masked by a previous non-specific blue staining pattern. Further, this protocol can be used for unequivocally differentiating between transgenic and non-transgenic barley plants.

AB Plants of the partial amphiploid Inia 66/Thinopyrum distichum (2n = 70)//Inia 66 (2n = 56) were used as male parents in crosses with the monosomic series in the common wheat cultivar Inia 66. The genome and homoeologous group of the monosomic used in the cross affected the distribution of chromosome number of the progeny plants in the F-2 and F-4. Meiosis in the pollen mother cells of the B1F7 partial amphiploids was not stable, and not different from that of the B1F1 in which univalents and multivalents were observed. Disomic addition lines were selected on the basis of morphology and meiotic stability in the F-2, F-4 and F-5. Eleven of the fourteen possible wheat-Th. distichum disomic addition lines were identified using chromosome C-band pattern, as well as size and arm ratio, as genetic markers. Addition of T. distichum chromosome J(dll) produced a phenotype indicating homoeology with wheat group-2 chromosomes. Clear indications of homoeology based on morphological characteristics were not obtained in any of the other addition lines, probably due to the mixed homoeology of the Th. distichum chromosomes relative to wheat. The addition lines were all susceptible to leaf rust, unlike the germplasm-line Indis which carries a leaf rust resistance gene on a translocation segment derived from Th. distichum. Instability of meiotic pairing was observed in all addition lines. The stability, or not, of progeny chromosome counts did not reflect the level of chromosome pairing instability in the parental plants. SDS-PAGE for gliadin-type seed proteins revealed two addition lines which expressed seed storage proteins uncommon to Inia 66 but typical of Th. distichum.

AB Disease resistance is a critical goal for many wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement programs. Wheat cultivars are affected by multiple diseases including the rusts and powdery mildew. The F-6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from 'Thatcher'*3/'CI13227' that had been previously characterized as having adult-plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr46 were further tested for resistance to stripe rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew. In field plot tests, the RILs segregated for resistance to stripe rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew, with the highest logarithm of odds (LOD) peak at the sequence tagged site marker csLV46, which is closely linked to Lr46 on chromosome 1BL. Marker csLV46 had the highest LOD scores and R-2 values for powdery mildew resistance, followed by stripe rust and leaf rust resistance. Tests for stem rust resistance had the lowest LOD scores. An additional quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 7AL for leaf rust resistance derived from CI13227 was detected in two of the three leaf rust tests. A QTL for stem rust resistance on chromosome 7AL derived from Thatcher was detected in two of the three stem rust tests.

AB Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP), a wild relative of wheat, could provide many desirable genes for wheat improvement. Microdissection and degenerate oligonucleotide primed -polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) is an effective way to isolate specific sequences. The development of specific sequences and functional markers of P genome could lay the foundation for gene mapping and cloning. In this study, chromosomes 6PS and 6PL were microdissected from wheat-A. cristatum 6PS and 6PL addition lines, and DOP-PCR products from both microdissected chromosomes were used as probes to hybridize with mitotic metaphase chromosomes of diploid A. cristatum, wheat-A. cristatum addition lines 6PS, 6PL, and 6P. The results showed that the distribution patterns on A. cristatum chromosomes using DOP-PCR products of microdissected 6PS as the probe were similar to those using DOP-PCR products of microdissected 6PL as the probe. They both distributed along all chromosomes, and chromosome 6P and other chromosomes were similar according to the hybridization pattern. There were no signals on wheat chromosomes indicating that DOP-PCR products contain P-genome specific sequences. Actually, we obtained a P-genome specific sequence from the DOP-PCR products of 6PS, which could be used as a fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe to identify P genome chromatin in wheat-A. cristatum introgression lines. These results could provide a basis for the study of structure and evolution of P genome chromosomes. Furthermore, this study may lead to mapping and cloning of the desirable genes on 6P chromosome.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a powerful tool for the discovery of important genes and alleles in crop plants and their wild relatives. Despite great advances in NGS technologies, whole-genome shotgun sequencing is cost-prohibitive for species with complex genomes. An attractive option is to reduce genome complexity to a single chromosome prior to sequencing. This work describes a strategy for studying the genomes of distant wild relatives of wheat by isolating single chromosomes from addition or substitution lines, followed by chromosome sorting using flow cytometry and sequencing of chromosomal DNA by NGS technology. We flow-sorted chromosome 5M(g) from a wheat/Aegilops geniculata disomic substitution line [DS5M(g) (5D)] and sequenced it using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system at approximately 50 3 coverage. Paired-end sequences were assembled and used for structural and functional annotation. A total of 4236 genes were annotated on 5M(g), in close agreement with the predicted number of genes on wheat chromosome 5D (4286). Single-gene FISH indicated no major chromosomal rearrangements between chromosomes 5M(g) and 5D. Comparing chromosome 5M(g) with model grass genomes identified synteny blocks in Brachypodium distachyon, rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Chromosome 5M(g)-specific SNPs and cytogenetic probe-based resources were developed and validated. Deletion bin-mapped and ordered 5M(g) SNP markers will be useful to track 5M-specific introgressions and translocations. This study provides a detailed sequence-based analysis of the composition of a chromosome from a distant wild relative of bread wheat, and opens up opportunities to develop genomic resources for wild germplasm to facilitate crop improvement.

AB A protocol is described for production of micrograms of DNA from single copies of flow-sorted plant chromosomes. Of 183 single copies of wheat chromosome 3B, 118 (64%) were successfully amplified. Sequencing DNA amplification products using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system to 103 coverage and merging sequences from three separate amplifications resulted in 60% coverage of the chromosome 3B reference, entirely covering 30% of its genes. The merged sequences permitted de novo assembly of 19% of chromosome 3B genes, with 10% of genes contained in a single contig, and 39% of genes covered for at least 80% of their length. The chromosome-derived sequences allowed identification of missing genic sequences in the chromosome 3B reference and short sequences similar to 3B in survey sequences of other wheat chromosomes. These observations indicate that single-chromosome sequencing is suitable to identify genic sequences on particular chromosomes, to develop chromosome-specific DNA markers, to verify assignment of DNA sequence contigs to individual pseudomolecules, and to validate whole-genome assemblies. The protocol expands the potential of chromosome genomics, which may now be applied to any plant species from which chromosome samples suitable for flow cytometry can be prepared, and opens new avenues for studies on chromosome structural heterozygosity and haplotype phasing in plants.

AB The huge size, redundancy, and highly repetitive nature of the bread wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.)] genome, makes it among the most difficult species to be sequenced. To overcome these limitations, a strategy based on the separation of individual chromosomes or chromosome arms and the subsequent production of physical maps was established within the frame of the International Wheat Genome Sequence Consortium (IWGSC). A total of 95,812 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of short-arm chromosome 5A (5AS) and long-arm chromosome 5A (5AL) arm-specific BAC libraries were fingerprinted and assembled into contigs by complementary analytical approaches based on the FingerPrinted Contig (FPC) and Linear Topological Contig (LTC) tools. Combined anchoring approaches based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) marker screening, microarray, and sequence homology searches applied to several genomic tools (i. e., genetic maps, deletion bin map, neighbor maps, BAC end sequences (BESs), genome zipper, and chromosome survey sequences) allowed the development of a high-quality physical map with an anchored physical coverage of 75% for 5AS and 53% for 5AL with high portions (64 and 48%, respectively) of contigs ordered along the chromosome. In the genome of grasses, Brachypodium [Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv.], rice (Oryza sativa L.), and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] homologs of genes on wheat chromosome 5A were separated into syntenic blocks on different chromosomes as a result of translocations and inversions during evolution. The physical map presented represents an essential resource for fine genetic mapping and map-based cloning of agronomically relevant traits and a reference for the 5A sequencing projects.

AB Development of wheat-alien translocation lines will facilitate its practical utilization in wheat improvement. The objective of the present study was to produce compensating wheat-Thinopyrum bessarabicum whole arm Robertsonian translocations (RobTs) involving chromosomes 2B of wheat and 2E(b) of Th. bessarabicum through the mechanism of centric breakage-fusion. F-2 population from crosses between DS2E(b)(2B) substitution line and bread wheat "Roushan" (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) as female parent were made. Forty one F (2) lines (L1-L41) were screened for their chromosome composition. Three 2E(b) specific PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers were used for screening F (2) progeny derived from plants double-monosomic for chromosome 2B and 2E(b). Two RobTs (similar to 5%) were observed among F (2) plants. Homozygous translocation (T2E(b)S.2BL) with good plant vigor and full fertility were selected from F (3) families. The T2E(b)S.2BL stock has longer awn than that of its parents. It is cytogenetically stable, and may be useful in wheat improvement.

AB Much effort has been directed at identifying sources of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat. We sought to identify molecular markers for what we hypothesized was a new major FHB resistance locus originating from the wheat cultivar 'Freedom' and introgressed into the susceptible wheat cultivar 'USU-Apogee'. An F-2:3 mapping population from a cross between Apogee and A30, its BC4 near-isoline exhibiting improved FHB resistance, was evaluated for resistance. The distribution of FHB resistance in the population approximated a 1: 3 moderately resistant : moderately susceptible + susceptible ratio. Separate disease evaluations established that A30 accumulated less deoxynivalenol and yielded a greater proportion of sound grain than Apogee. Molecular mapping revealed that the FHB resistance of A30 is associated with molecular markers on chromosome arm 3DL that exhibit a null phenotype in A30 but are present in both Apogee and Freedom, indicating a spontaneous deletion occurred during the development of A30. Aneuploid analysis revealed that the size of the deleted segment is approximately 19% of the arm's length. Our results suggest that the deleted interval of chromosome arm 3DL in Apogee may harbor FHB susceptibility genes that promote disease spread in infected spikes, and that their elimination increases FHB resistance in a novel manner.

AB Four F-1 hybrids of hot pepper (Capsicum spp.), the result of crossing soft-fleshed, hot, red-fruited lines with hard-fleshed, sweet, red-and yellow-fruited cultivars, were used as donor plants for in vitro anther culture. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that one-third of the plantlets derived from anther culture contained 2C DNA. Thirty-five fully-developed diploid plants were then used for genetic analysis. Ripe fruit colour, pericarp structure and taste, and the effect of marker gene activity were included in the evaluation. Seventy-four percent of the plants examined differed from the donor plant phenotype in their marker characteristics. Differences occurred in one (16 plants), two (nine plants), or three (one plant) of the characteristics considered. The other nine diploid plants showed differences from the corresponding stock plant in terms of quantitative fruit characteristics such as length, width, fresh weight, pericarp weight, pericarp as a proportion of fruit weight, wall thickness, and dry matter content. Significant differences were found in three-to-six of the characters listed. The results confirmed the androgenic origin of all diploid plants. Also, high levels of genetic variation were found in the androdiploids produced, both in terms of the yield and market value of their fruit. The weight of all fruit per plant ranged from 44 g to 1.24 kg. For each diploid, there were recombinants that were significantly different from their donor plant. The androdiploids could provide attractive stock material for breeding new cultivars of Capsicum spp.

AB The stem rust fungus, particularly race TTKSK (Ug99), poses a serious threat to world wheat production. Gene Sr42 or SrCad (which could be the same gene or an allele of Sr42) is effective against race TTKSK. However, known genetic markers for Sr42 are mostly SSR markers which are generally labor intensive to use. In this study, we mapped a race TTKSK resistance gene derived from PI 595667 at the same locus as Sr42 on chromosome 6DS. Based on position, pedigree and infection-type information, we propose that this gene is SrCad (Sr42). We enriched the genetic map for the Sr42 region using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and array-derived SNP markers. In total, 21 SNP markers were discovered, spanning a genetic distance of 27.2 cM. Nine of them are derived from GBS and twelve from the Illumina iSelect 90K SNP assay. Ten of the twenty-one SNP markers are closely linked (<2.2 cM, or co-segregating) with Sr42. We converted five of the closely linked SNP markers into uniplex KASP assays which will better facilitate marker-assisted selection. We validated the KASP assay in a doubled haploid wheat population derived from a three-way cross between accessions PI 410954, RB07, and Faller that shared an uncharacterized resistance gene mapped at approximately the same locus as PI 595667. The development of closely linked (co-segregating), codominant, sequence-based SNP assays will aid marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning of Sr42.

AB The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) quantitative trait locus (QTL) QSb. bhu-5B, which determines resistance to spot blotch (causative pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana), was mapped to an interval of 0.62 cM on chromosome arm 5BL via the analysis of a recombinant inbred line population bred from a cross between 'YS116' and 'Sonalika.' 'YS116' is an F-12 selection from the cross 'Yangmai 6' (source of resistance) 9 'Sonalika,' which contains only one spot blotch resistance QTL. Lines tested from F-3 to F-5 were inoculated in the field with B. sorokiniana over three consecutive seasons. Measurements of both disease severity and the area under the disease progress curve were used to assess each line's disease response. In the present population, QSb. bhu-5B, which is flanked by the SSR loci Xgwm639 (0.28 cM) and Xgwm1043, behaved as a single Mendelian gene and was given the gene symbol Sb2. The physical location of Sb2 is within the 5BL1-0.55-0.75 deletion bin. Both Xgwm1043 and Xgwm639 were effective as indirect selection tools in various genetic backgrounds.

AB Molecular identification of wheat powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes in breeding lines or cultivars is important for resistance breeding. Wanfengjian 34, a Chinese wheat breeding line with desirable agricultural performance in China, showed high level of resistance to powdery mildew at both seedling and adult stages. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the resistance to different Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates in Wanfengjian 34 was controlled by a single dominant Pm gene, temporarily designated PmWFJ. PmWFJ was mapped to chromosome arm 5DS and flanked by the simple sequence repeat marker Cfd81 and sequence characterized amplified region marker SCAR112 with genetic distance of 0.1 and 1.0 cM, respectively. PmWFJ shared the same locus with the documented Pm genes on the multi-allelic Pm2 locus by allelism tests between PmWFJ and Pm2 alleles, but showed unique powdery mildew reaction pattern compared with these documented Pm genes. Therefore, PmWFJ appears to be a new allele at the documented Pm2 locus. Four closely linked markers of PmWFJ were validated the applicability in 131 cultivar backgrounds for marker-assisted selection.

AB The tolerance of triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) cultivars to aluminum (Al) stress observed in acid soils is an important agronomic trait affecting seed yield. Traditionally, breeding of Al-tolerant cultivars was selection based; for example, using a physiological test. However, such selection methods are relatively slow and require numerous plants for phenotype evaluation. Alternatively, DNA-based molecular marker systems could be applied to identify markers useful for selection purposes. Among many marker platforms available, Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) is one of the most promising. DArT markers preselected for conversion to specific PCR assays were chosen based on association mapping studies using diverse materials. Forty-nine DArT markers were selected and tested for redundancy based on their segregation patterns and sequences, and 40 were successfully converted into specific PCR assays. However, only 24 of these proved to be polymorphic. Where possible, the chromosomal locations of the converted markers were verified. The markers assigned to chromosome 7R that were the most highly correlated with Al-tolerant and non-tolerant plants were chosen for marker assisted selection using genetically diverse triticale materials.

AB The HfrDrd gene has been reported to be induced specifically in the wheat's defence response to Hessian fly larvae and is not a general stress-responsive gene. The gene is located on chromosome 7DS with a homeologue on 7AS. In this study, two SNPs in the gene that result in amino acid substitutions in the dirigent-like protein have been identified. Both are C/T polymorphisms at nt position 86 and 143 in exon 1 of the gene. The first SNP (from 50 end) causes an alanine-to-valine substitution. The second is a serine-to-leucine change and is located in the conserved dirigent domain. Both 'T' nucleotide SNPs are characteristic of the Hessian fly-resistant genotype, Iris (JX501668, JX501669). Only SNP 143 has been found to be significantly associated with Hessian fly resistance. One hundred and seventy-one Australian cultivars screened were susceptible and have the 'C' nucleotide at SNP 143. The 'T' SNP at nt 143 was found in thirteen resistant cultivars, and the heterozygous state was identified in four other resistant cultivars. This study has identified other resistant genotypes which do not carry the 'T' nucleotide at nt 143 in the gene. Their resistance mechanism possibly involves other Hessian fly-response (Hfr) genes. SNP 143 will be useful for deployment in developing varieties with the resistant HfrDrd allele.

AB Preharvest sprouting (PHS) is one of the major constraints of wheat production in areas where prolonged rainfall occurs during harvest. TaPHS1 is a gene that regulates PHS resistance on chromosome 3A of wheat, and two causal mutations in the positions +646 and +666 of the TaPHS1 coding region result in wheat PHS susceptibility. Three competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed based on the two mutations in the coding region and one in the promoter region and validated in 82 wheat cultivars with known genotypes. These markers can be used to transfer TaPHS1 in breeding through marker-assisted selection.
   Screening of 327 accessions of wheat A genome progenitors using the three KASP markers identified different haplotypes in both diploid and tetraploid wheats. Only one Triticum monococcum accession, however, carries both causal mutations in the TaPHS1 coding region and shows PHS susceptibility. Five of 249 common wheat landraces collected from the Fertile Crescent and surrounding areas carried the mutation (C) in the promoter (-222), and one landrace carries both the causal mutations in the TaPHS1 coding region, indicating that the mis-splicing (+646) mutation occurred during common wheat domestication.
   PHS assay of wheat progenitor accessions demonstrated that the wild-types were highly PHS-resistant, whereas the domesticated type showed increased PHS susceptibility.
   The mis-splicing TaPHS1 mutation for PHS susceptibility was involved in wheat domestication and might arise independently between T. monococcum and Triticum aestivum.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important crop in South Asia and epidemics of stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, can impact negatively on food security. In a pro-active assessment of the risk posed by this disease, germplasm collections received from Bangladesh and Nepal in 2011 were screened for their response to Sr31-virulent stem rust races belonging to the Ug99 group. According to a molecular marker assay, 44% of Bangladesh lines and 48% of Nepal lines contained Sr31. In seedling tests, most entries were susceptible to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race PTKST, confirming the ineffectiveness of Sr31. No lines contained Sr24 or Sr36, two major genes that have been overcome by races within the Ug99 group. Despite seedling susceptibility, many lines exhibited high levels of adult plant resistance in the field. The presence of the Sr2 marker allele of csSr2 in some of these lines indicated that this gene is likely to play a role in the adult plant resistance observed. This study showed that sufficient protection to Ug99 exists in Bangladesh and Nepal wheat germplasm, and that the appropriate release of resistant cultivars will insure against a possible future incursion of this dangerous pathogen.

AB Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, an obligate aerial biotrophic fungus, would be one of the most damaging wheat (Triticum aestivum) diseases without the extensive use of conventional fungicides. In our study, the expression levels of some basal defence-related genes were investigated during a compatible interaction in order to evaluate wheat reactions to infection, along with the different stages of the infectious process in planta. As fungal conidia initiated their germination and developed appressorial germ tube (AGT), early defence reactions involved the expression of a lipoxygenase (LOX)- and an oxalate oxidase (OXO)-encoding genes, followed by activations of corresponding LOX (EC 1.13.11.12) and OXO (EC 1.2.3.4) activities, respectively. When penetration of AGT took place, up-regulation of chitinases (CHI) and PR1-encoding genes expression occurred along with an increase of CHI (EC 3.2.1.14) activity. Meanwhile, expression of a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase-encoding gene also took place. Up-regulation of a phospholipase C- and lipid transfer proteins-encoding genes expression occurred during the latest stages of infection. Neither the phi glutathione S-transferase (GST)-encoding gene expression nor the GST (EC 2.5.1.13) activity was modified upon wheat infection by powdery mildew. Whether these defence reactions during such a compatible interaction are markers of immunity or susceptibility, and whether they have the ability to contribute to protection upon modulation of their timing and their intensity by resistance inducers are discussed.

AB Using GWAS, 13 significant SNPs distributed on six of the seven Aegilops tauschii chromosomes (all but 5D) were identified, and several candidate P-deficiency-responsive genes were proposed from searches of public databases.
   Aegilops tauschii, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) D-genome progenitor, possesses numerous genes for stress resistance, including genes for tolerance of phosphorus (P) deficiency. Investigation of the genetic architecture of A. tauschii will help in developing P-deficiency-tolerant varieties of wheat. We evaluated nine traits in a population of 380 A. tauschii specimens under conditions with and without P application, and we performed genome-wide association studies for these traits using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips containing 7185 markers. Using a general linear model, we identified 119 SNPs that were significantly associated with all nine traits, and a mixed linear model revealed 18 SNPs associated with all traits. Both models detected 13 significant markers distributed on six of the seven A. tauschii chromosomes (all but 5D). Searches of public databases revealed several candidate/flanking genes related to P-deficiency tolerance. These genes were grouped in five categories by the types of proteins they encoded: defense response proteins, enzymes, promoters and transcription factors, storage proteins, or proteins triggered by P deficiency. The identified SNPs and genes contain essential information for cloning genes related to P-deficiency tolerance in A. tauschii and wheat, and they provide a foundation for breeding P-deficiency tolerant wheat cultivars.

AB Two mapping approaches were use to identify and validate milling and baking quality QTL in soft wheat. Two LG were consistently found important for multiple traits and we recommend the use marker-assisted selection on specific markers reported here.
   Wheat-derived food products require a range of characteristics. Identification and understanding of the genetic components controlling end-use quality of wheat is important for crop improvement. We assessed the underlying genetics controlling specific milling and baking quality parameters of soft wheat including flour yield, softness equivalent, flour protein, sucrose, sodium carbonate, water absorption and lactic acid, solvent retention capacities in a diversity panel and five bi-parental mapping populations. The populations were genotyped with SSR and DArT markers, with markers specific for the 1BL.1RS translocation and sucrose synthase gene. Association analysis and composite interval mapping were performed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). High heritability was observed for each of the traits evaluated, trait correlations were consistent over populations, and transgressive segregants were common in all bi-parental populations. A total of 26 regions were identified as potential QTL in the diversity panel and 74 QTL were identified across all five bi-parental mapping populations. Collinearity of QTL from chromosomes 1B and 2B was observed across mapping populations and was consistent with results from the association analysis in the diversity panel. Multiple regression analysis showed the importance of the two 1B and 2B regions and marker-assisted selection for the favorable alleles at these regions should improve quality.

AB Wheat lines with shortened Th. ponticum chromatin carrying Fhb7 and molecular markers linked to Fhb7 will accelerate the transfer of Fhb7 to breeding lines and provide an important resource for future map-based cloning of this gene.
   Fusarium head blight is a major wheat disease globally. A major FHB resistance gene, designated as Fhb7, derived from Thinopyrum ponticum, was earlier transferred to common wheat, but was not used in wheat breeding due to linkage drag. The aims of this study were to (1) saturate this FHB resistance gene region; (2) develop and characterize secondary translocation lines with shortened Thinopyrum segments carrying Fhb7 using ph1b; (3) pyramid Fhb7 and Fhb1 by marker-assisted selection. Fhb7 was mapped in a 1.7 cM interval that was flanked by molecular markers XsdauK66 and Xcfa2240 with SSR, diversity arrays technology, EST-derived and conserved markers. KS24-2 carrying Fhb7 was analyzed with molecular markers and genomic in situ hybridization, confirming it was a 7DS.7el(2)L Robertsonian translocation. To reduce the Thinopyrum chromatin segments carrying Fhb7, a BC1F2 population (Chinese Spring ph1bph1b*2/KS24-2) was developed and genotyped with the markers linked to Fhb7. Two new translocation lines (SDAU1881 and SDAU1886) carrying Fhb7 on shortened alien segments (approximately 16.1 and 17.3 % of the translocation chromosome, respectively) were developed. Furthermore, four wheat lines (SDAU1902, SDAU1903, SDAU1904, and SDAU1906) with the pyramided markers flanking Fhb1 and Fhb7 were developed and the FHB responses indicated lines with mean NDS ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 had successfully combined Fhb7 and Fhb1. Three new molecular markers associated with Fhb7 were identified and validated in 35 common wheat varieties. The translocation lines with shortened alien segments carrying Fhb7 (and Fhb1) and the markers closely linked to Fhb7 will be useful for improving wheat scab resistance.

AB New QTL for Septoria tritici blotch detected in hexapoid spring wheat under field conditions across diverse environments.
   Septoria tritici blotch caused by the ascomycete fungus Zymoseptoria tritici presents a serious and consistent challenge to global wheat production. In particular the augmented use of soil management practices that leave large amounts of wheat stubble on the soil surface and global warming increases the chance of Septoria tritici blotch epidemics to emerge more frequently including in developing countries. Two recombinant inbred line populations developed from a cross between the susceptible Moroccan spring bread wheat variety 'NASMA' and the CIMMYT resistant lines, 'IAS20*5/H567.71' and 'RPB709.71/COC' were used to study the genetics and map adult-plant resistance to Septoria tritici blotch under field conditions in different environments. Resistance to Septoria tritici blotch in both populations was quantitative and overall, five across environment consistent resistance loci on chromosomes 1BS, 3AL, 5AL and 7AS were detected in the two populations. The QTL on chromosome 1BS and 7AS are likely to be allelic with the known Septoria tritici blotch genes Stb3 and Stb11. All identified QTL were additive and explained between 4 and 27 % of the phenotypic variation. Epistatic interaction was not observed. Low cost KASP assays were developed as flanking markers for all five QTL that will facilitate molecular breeding. Our study represents the first mapping effort under field conditions utilizing two spring bread wheat resistant sources evaluated over multiple environments.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is an important foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. In the present study, CIMMYT line 19HRWSN-122 and 36 lines with known Lr (leaf rust resistance) genes were inoculated with 13 Chinese P. triticina pathotypes for postulation of Lr genes at the seedling stage. Line 19HRWSN-122 showed high resistance to all 13 P. triticina pathotypes in the greenhouse, indicating that it carries effective seedling resistance. This may be due to a resistance gene combination, an effective gene to all pathotypes present in China or a new resistance gene. With the objective of mapping the putatively new gene for resistance to leaf rust, 20 F-1, 280 F-2 plants and 254 F-2:3 lines from the cross 19HRWSN-122 x Zhengzhou 5389 (susceptible) were inoculated with P. triticina pathotype THJP in the greenhouse. Results based on the F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 lines indicated that a single dominant gene, temporarily designated LrHR122, was present in 19HRWSN-122. Bulked segregant analysis was performed on equal amounts of genomic DNA from ten resistant and ten susceptible F-2:3 lines. Molecular markers polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible bulks were used to genotype F-2:3 lines. LrHR122 was linked to one SSR marker, one STS marker, one SCAR marker and three EST markers on chromosome 3DL. Marker SCS1302 (609) co-segregated with LrHR122, and the closest flanking markers were BE442875 and STS24-16 at genetic distances of 0.4 and 0.4 cM, respectively. Lr24 is known to be located on chromosome 3DL near LrHR122. In seedling tests, lines with both LrHR122 and Lr24 showed high resistance to all 13 Chinese P. triticina pathotypes. According to the pedigree and chromosome position LrHR122 should be Lr24. Lr24 was closely linked to one SSR marker and three EST markers in the terminal region of 3DL. These markers should be useful for marker assisted selection in breeding leaf rust resistant wheat cultivars.

AB Three race-specific genes were identified in a cross between the durably leaf rust resistant wheat cultivar Buck Poncho (BP) and leaf rust susceptible cultivar Purple Straw (P). Two seedling resistance genes, temporarily named LrBP1 and LrBP2, and one adult plant resistance gene named LrBP3 were identified. Multi-pathotype tests on seedlings of BP and Thatcher near-isogenic lines carrying single resistance genes indicated that Lr10 and Lr11 were candidates for LrBP1 and LrBP2, respectively. The identification of LrBP1 as Lr10 was corroborated by markers previously reported to be linked to Lr10. LrBP2 was linked to 12 markers located on the short arm of chromosome 2D, the closest of which was SCAR32/35 at 0.3 cM. Lr11 was previously located in chromosome 2A, but monosomic analysis and telocentric mapping indicated that Lr11 was distally located in chromosome 2DS. The presence of the expected PCR fragment of SCAR32/35 in BP and wheat lines carrying Lr11, and results from an allelism test between a stock carrying LrBP2 with one carrying Lr11, indicated that these two genes are most likely the same. Thirteen markers located in chromosome 6A were loosely linked to LrBP3. Lines carrying the three resistance genes were evaluated for leaf rust response in the field. None of the gene combinations showed infection severities as low as BP, indicating that the three genes only partially explained the observed level of resistance in BP.

AB The synchronization of flowering with the time of most favorable temperatures and light has substantial effects on grain yield and quality. In bread wheat, the major developmental genes determining vernalization requirement (Vrn-1) and photoperiod response are used in breeding cultivars adapted to different latitudes and climates. Fine regulation of flowering date is provided by minor genes whose allelic variation is not well studied. Although spring cultivars Saratovskaya 29 (S29) and Yanetzkis Probat (YP) carry the same two dominant Vrn-1 alleles, YP is several days later in flowering compared to S29. The aim of the current study was to establish the chromosomal and map locations of loci determining this difference. Inter-cultivar single chromosome substitution lines S29(YP) and a set of recombinant chromosome substitution double haploid lines grown at three contrasting climatic and geographic locations in Western Siberia and Europe. The substitution line S29(YP 4D*7A) carrying the entire donor chromosome 4D and an additional fragment of chromosome 7A showed the largest delay in flowering at all sites. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) between microsatellite markers Xgwm0089 and Xgwm4736 on chromosome 4D was detected only in Europe following substantially earlier sowing. It was manifested under increasing day length, and, therefore, was regarded as a photoperiod response locus. Another QTL associated with (TG)(8 or 9)-(CG)(3) polymorphism of the TaFTA gene on chromosome 7A was effective under both long and short days thus representing an intrinsic earliness per se gene. This knowledge could aid the fine regulation of flowering in cultivars tailored for growing in specific agro-climatic conditions.

AB Aegilops tauschii is the D-genome progenitor of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). It is considered to be an important source of genetic variation for wheat breeding, and its genome is an invaluable reference for wheat genomics. We conducted a genome-wide association study using 7,185 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across 322 diverse accessions of Ae. tauschii that were systematically phenotyped for 29 morphological traits in order to identify marker-trait associations and candidate genes, assess genetic diversity, and classify the accessions based on phenotypic data and genotypic comparison. Using the general linear model and mixed linear model, we identified a total of 18 SNPs significantly associated with 10 morphological traits. Systematic search of the flanking sequences of trait-associated SNPs in public databases identified several genes that may be linked to variations in phenotypes. Cluster analysis using phenotypic data grouped accessions into four clusters, while accessions in the same cluster were not from the same Ae. tauschii subspecies or from the same area of origin. This work establishes a fundamental research platform for association studies in Ae. tauschii and also provides useful information for understanding the genetic mechanism of agronomic traits in wheat.

AB Background: 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) is the sixth and penultimate enzyme in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway, and is the target of the herbicide glyphosate. The EPSPS genes of allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) have not been well characterized. Herein, the three homoeologous copies of the allohexaploid wheat EPSPS gene were cloned and characterized.
   Methods: Genomic and coding DNA sequences of EPSPS from the three related genomes of allohexaploid wheat were isolated using PCR and inverse PCR approaches from soft white spring "Louise'. Development of genome-specific primers allowed the mapping and expression analysis of TaEPSPS-7A1, TaEPSPS-7D1, and TaEPSPS-4A1 on chromosomes 7A, 7D, and 4A, respectively. Sequence alignments of cDNA sequences from wheat and wheat relatives served as a basis for phylogenetic analysis.
   Results: The three genomic copies of wheat EPSPS differed by insertion/deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), largely in intron sequences. RT-PCR analysis and cDNA cloning revealed that EPSPS is expressed from all three genomic copies. However, TaEPSPS-4A1 is expressed at much lower levels than TaEPSPS-7A1 and TaEPSPS-7D1 in wheat seedlings. Phylogenetic analysis of 1190-bp cDNA clones from wheat and wheat relatives revealed that: 1) TaEPSPS-7A1 is most similar to EPSPS from the tetraploid AB genome donor, T. turgidum (99.7 % identity); 2) TaEPSPS-7D1 most resembles EPSPS from the diploid D genome donor, Aegilops tauschii (100 % identity); and 3) TaEPSPS-4A1 resembles EPSPS from the diploid B genome relative, Ae. speltoides (97.7 % identity). Thus, EPSPS sequences in allohexaploid wheat are preserved from the most two recent ancestors. The wheat EPSPS genes are more closely related to Lolium multiflorum and Brachypodium distachyon than to Oryza sativa (rice).
   Conclusions: The three related EPSPS homoeologues of wheat exhibited conservation of the exon/intron structure and of coding region sequence, but contained significant sequence variation within intron regions. The genome-specific primers developed will enable future characterization of natural and induced variation in EPSPS sequence and expression. This can be useful in investigating new causes of glyphosate herbicide resistance.

AB Background: Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a major cereal disease in semi-arid areas worldwide. Of the various QTL reported, the one on chromosome arm 3BL (Qcrs.cpi-3B) has the largest effect that can be consistently detected in different genetic backgrounds. Nine sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) for this locus were made available in a previous study. To identify markers that could be reliably used in tagging the Qcrs.cpi-3B locus, a NIL-derived population consisting of 774 F-10 lines were generated and exploited to assess markers selected from the existing linkage map and generated from sequences of the 3B pseudomolecule.
   Results: This is the first report on fine mapping a QTL conferring FCR resistance in wheat. By three rounds of linkage mapping using the NILs and the NIL-derived population, the Qcrs.cpi-3B locus was mapped to an interval of 0.7 cM covering a physical distance of about 1.5 Mb. Seven markers co-segregating with the locus were developed. This interval contains a total of 63 gene-coding sequences based on the 3B pseudomolecule, and six of them were known to encode disease resistance proteins. Several of the genes in this interval were among those responsive to FCR infection detected in an earlier study.
   Conclusions: The accurate localization of the Qcrs.cpi-3B locus and the development of the markers co-segregating with it should facilitate the incorporation of this large-effect QTL conferring FCR resistance into breeding programs as well as the cloning of the gene(s) underlying the QTL.

AB Background: The large and complex genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., similar to 17 Gb) requires high resolution genome maps with saturated marker scaffolds to anchor and orient BAC contigs/sequence scaffolds for whole genome assembly. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping has proven to be an excellent tool for the development of such maps for it offers much higher and more uniform marker resolution across the length of the chromosome compared to genetic mapping and does not require marker polymorphism per se, as it is based on presence (retention) vs. absence (deletion) marker assay.
   Methods: In this study, a 178 line RH panel was genotyped with SSRs and DArT markers to develop the first high resolution RH maps of the entire D-genome of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78. To confirm map order accuracy, the AL8/78-RH maps were compared with: 1) a DArT consensus genetic map constructed using more than 100 biparental populations, 2) a RH map of the D-genome of reference hexaploid wheat 'Chinese Spring', and 3) two SNP-based genetic maps, one with anchored D-genome BAC contigs and another with anchored D-genome sequence scaffolds. Using marker sequences, the RH maps were also anchored with a BAC contig based physical map and draft sequence of the D-genome of Ae. tauschii.
   Results: A total of 609 markers were mapped to 503 unique positions on the seven D-genome chromosomes, with a total map length of 14,706.7 cR. The average distance between any two marker loci was 29.2 cR which corresponds to 2.1 cM or 9.8 Mb. The average mapping resolution across the D-genome was estimated to be 0.34 Mb (Mb/cR) or 0.07 cM (cM/cR). The RH maps showed almost perfect agreement with several published maps with regard to chromosome assignments of markers. The mean rank correlations between the position of markers on AL8/78 maps and the four published maps, ranged from 0.75 to 0.92, suggesting a good agreement in marker order. With 609 mapped markers, a total of 2481 deletions for the whole D-genome were detected with an average deletion size of 42.0 Mb. A total of 520 markers were anchored to 216 Ae. tauschii sequence scaffolds, 116 of which were not anchored earlier to the D-genome.
   Conclusion: This study reports the development of first high resolution RH maps for the D-genome of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78, which were then used for the anchoring of unassigned sequence scaffolds. This study demonstrates how RH mapping, which offered high and uniform resolution across the length of the chromosome, can facilitate the complete sequence assembly of the large and complex plant genomes.

AB Leymus mollis (2n = 4x = 28, NsNsXmXm) possesses novel and important genes for resistance against multi-fungal diseases. The development of new wheat-L. mollis introgression lines is of great significance for wheat disease resistance breeding. M11003-3-1-15-8, a novel disomic substitution line of common wheat cv. 7182 -L. mollis, developed and selected from the BC1F5 progeny between wheat cv. 7182 and octoploid Tritileymus M47 (2n = 8x = 56, AABBDDNsNs), was characterized by morphological and cytogenetic identification, analysis of functional molecular markers, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and disease resistance evaluation. Cytological observations suggested that M11003-3-1-15-8 contained 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. The GISH investigations showed that line contained 40 wheat chromosomes and a pair of L. mollis chromosomes. EST-STS multiple loci markers and PLUG (PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene) markers confirmed that the introduced L. mollis chromosomes belonged to homoeologous group 7, it was designated as Lm#7Ns. While nulli-tetrasomic and sequential FISH-GISH analysis using the oligonucleotide Oligo-pSc119.2 and Oligo-pTa535 as probes revealed that the wheat 7D chromosomes were absent in M11003-3-1-15-8. Therefore, it was deduced that M11003-3-1-15-8 was a wheat-L. mollis Lm#7Ns (7D) disomic substitution line. Field disease resistance demonstrated that the introduced L. mollis chromosomes Lm#7Ns were responsible for the stripe rust resistance at the adult stage. Moreover, M11003-3-1-15-8 had a superior numbers of florets. The novel disomic substitution line M11003-3-1-15-8, could be exploited as an important genetic material in wheat resistance breeding programs and genetic resources.

AB In previous studies, our research team successfully transferred the Ns genome from Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng into Triticum aestivum (common wheat cv. 7182) using embryo culture. In the present study, one of these lines, i.e., hybrid progeny 25-10-3, which matured about 10-14 days earlier than its wheat parent, was assessed using sequenced characterized amplified region (SCAR) analysis, EST-SSR and EST-STS molecular markers, and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). We found that this was a stable wheat-P. huashanica disomic addition line (2n = 44 = 22 II) and the results demonstrated that it was a 6Ns disomic chromosome addition line, but it exhibited many different features compared with previously characterized lines, i.e., a longer awn, early maturation, and no twin spikelets. It was considered to be an early-maturing variety based on the early stage of inflorescence initiation in field experiments and binocular microscope observations over three consecutive years. This characteristic was distinct, especially from the single ridge stage and double ridge stage until the glume stage. In addition, it had a higher photosynthesis rate and economic values than common wheat cv. 7182, i.e., more spikelets per spike, more florets per spikelet, more kernels per spike, and a higher thousand-grain weight. These results suggest that this material may comprise a genetic pool of beneficial genes or chromosome segments, which are suitable for introgression to improve the quality of common wheat.

AB Wheat-rye translocations carry valuable genes for pest resistance; this has led to their incorporation into wheat varieties. To develop gene-based 1RS specific markers, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) mapped to the short arm of wheat homoeologous group 1 were downloaded from a public database. ESTs and mature transcript sequences of nine species from the Poaceae family were BLASTed to perform comparative analysis. ESTs selected using the BLAST tool were used for primer design. The target sequences of primers were expected to exist in most species of the Poaceae family, and therefore, cross-species primers were designed. Amplicons obtained using these cross-species primer pairs were sequenced in the 1BL.1RS near-isolines (OK91G113' [1BL.1RS] and OK91G114' [non-translocation]), Chinese Spring' and Petkus' rye (1RS donor for 1BL.1RS translocations). Through in silico analysis and primer validation, we were able to develop four 1RS-specific markers and these markers were confirmed with analysis involving 15 1RS translocation lines.

AB Hybrid chlorosis, one of the reproductive barriers between tetraploid wheat and its D-genome progenitor, Aegilops tauschii, inhibits normal growth of synthetic wheat hexaploids. Hybrid chlorosis appears to be due to an epistatic interaction of two loci from the AB and D wheat genomes. Our previous study assigned the causal D-genome gene for hybrid chlorosis, Hch1, to the short arm of chromosome 7D. Here, we constructed a fine map of 7DS near Hch1 using 280 F-2 individuals from a cross of two wheat synthetic lines, one showing normal growth and the other showing hybrid chlorosis. The hybrid chlorosis phenotype was controlled by a single dominant allele of the Hch1 locus in the synthetic hexaploids. Hch1 was closely linked to four new markers within 0.2 cM, and may be localized near or within the two Ae. tauschii scaffolds containing the linked markers on 7DS. Comparative analysis of the Hch1 chromosomal region for Ae. tauschii, barley and Brachypodium showed that a local inversion occurred in the region proximal to Hch1 during the divergence between barley and Ae. tauschii, and that the Hch1 region on wheat 7DS is syntenic to Brachypodium chromosome 1. These observations provide useful information for further studies toward map-based cloning of Hch1.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is a crop of global significance. However, a third of the genes of barley are largely inaccessible to conventional breeding programmes as crossovers are localised to the ends of the chromosomes. This work examines whether crossovers can be shifted to more proximal regions simply by elevating growth temperature.
   We utilised a genome-wide marker set for linkage analysis combined with cytological mapping of crossover events to examine the recombination landscape of plants grown at different temperatures.
   We found that barley shows heterochiasmy, that is, differences between female and male recombination frequencies. In addition, we found that elevated temperature significantly changes patterns of recombination in male meiosis only, with a repositioning of Class I crossovers determined by cytological mapping of HvMLH3 foci. We show that the length of synaptonemal complexes in male meiocytes increases in response to temperature.
   The results demonstrate that the distribution of crossover events are malleable and can be shifted to proximal regions by altering the growth temperature. The shift in recombination is the result of altering the distribution of Class I crossovers, but the higher recombination at elevated temperatures is potentially not the result of an increase in Class I events.

AB Shortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis) is a troublesome grass weed infesting winter wheat and oilseed rape productions in China. Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl failed to control shortawn foxtail of AHSX-1 population collected from a wheat field in Shou County, Anhui province. Molecular analyses revealed that Asp(2078)Gly mutation of ACCase and Trp(574)Leu mutation of AHAS were present in plants of the AHSX-1 population. The homozygous plants were isolated and cultured until seed maturity. Whole-plant herbicide bioassays were conducted in the greenhouse using the purified seeds of F1 generation. Dose-response experiments showed that the AHSX-1 population has evolved a very high level resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (RI = 275) and mesosulfuron-methyl (RI = 788). To determine the sensitivity to other herbicides, assays were conducted at the single recommended rate of each herbicide. Based on the results, the AHSX-1 population was considered to be highly resistant to clodinafop-propargyl, pyroxsulam and flucarbazone-sodium, moderately or highly resistant to quizalofop-p-ethyl, clethodim, sethoxydim and pinoxaden, and susceptible to isoproturon and chlorotoluron. This is the first report of Asp(2078)Gly mutation in shortawn foxtail and the two robust dCAPS markers designed could quickly detect Asp(2078) and Trp(574) mutations in ACCase and AHAS gene of shortawn foxtail, respectively.

AB Wheat-Haynaldia villosa translocations T6V#2S.6AL and T6V#4S.6DL, carriers of Pm21 and PmV, respectively, continue to contribute powdery mildew resistance in wheat varieties in China. Based on colinearity between Brachypodium distachyon and Triticeae species, genomic sequences from gene intervals of B. distachyon physically linked to a homolog of Stpk-V, a key part of Pm21, were used to design primers and screen for codominant and stable markers. An anonymous marker, MBH1, tagging both Pm21 in 6V#2S and PmV in 6V#4S was identified. It also distinguished wheat 6AS- and 6DS-derived homoeoalleles of MBH1. Sequence length comparisons showed a decreasing order of 6AS > 6DS > 6V#2S > 6V#4S. F-2 segregation analyses were conducted on crosses Yangmai 18 (T6V#2S.6AL)/Yangmai 19 and Yangmai 16/Yangmai 22 (T6V#4S.6DL). MBH1 detected homozygosity of both Pm21 and PmV in segregating populations. The results also showed that T6V#2S.6AL is more transmittable than T6V#4S.6DL. Using MBH1, we reconfirmed the identities of powdery mildew resistance genes in Yangmai 21, Zhenmai 9, and Yangmai 97G59. The resistance donor to all three was T6V#2S.6AL, indicating that the published pedigrees were not correct. Pm21 in NAU419-Y15, an intercalary translocation carrying Pm21, was also tagged by MBH1. MBH1 is a broadly applicable marker for selecting and distinguishing the translocation chromosomes carrying Pm21 and PmV, which continue to be effective in China.

AB DNA-based methods are rapid, cost-effective and broadly applicable approaches for food authentication. Recently, the requirements for food safety and food integrity have increased with improved quality of life. Methodologies regarding food authentication based on DNA analysis are more commonly being used. With the increasing number of vegetarians, searching for markers for blind identification across kingdom species, such as an ingredient of animal origin in vegetarian food, would be valuable and attractive. Using bioinformatic analysis of an existing data source composed of 481 ultraconserved sequences, we selected 6 new candidate DNA segments that exist in most vertebrates but that do not exist in plants. Then, primers were designed for all of the candidate DNA markers, and DNA samples isolated from cow, pig, chicken, duck, soy bean, rice, pepper, wheat, sunflower and colza were amplified using each primer pair. None of the plant DNA samples generated a PCR product, while the DNA samples of animal origin were amplified successfully using 5 of the candidate segment primers; the 6th segment primer failed to amplify the DNA and was discarded. Moreover, a simulation experiment containing a plant product contaminated by an animal component indicated that the candidate DNA markers can be used for the rapid detection of animal adulterants in vegetarian products with a promising 5% detection limit. The identified candidate DNA markers for the blind identification of animal adulteration in vegetarian food may be highly desirable in the vegetarian food market, and these markers may facilitate the study of molecular technology for food authentication.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating fungal disease in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Chinese wheat cultivars Lumai 21' and Jingshuang 16' show moderate levels of adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in the field, and they showed a mean maximum disease severity (MDS) ranging from 24 to 56.7% and 26 to 59%, respectively, across different environments. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to stripe rust in an F-3 population of 199 lines derived from Lumai 21'xJingshuang 16'. The F-3 lines were evaluated for MDS in Qingshui, Gansu province, and Chengdu, Sichuan province, in the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 cropping seasons. Five QTL for APR were detected on chromosomes 2B (2 QTL), 2DS, 4DL and 5DS based on mean MDS in each environment and averaged values from all three environments. These QTL were designated QYr.caas-2BS.2, QYr.caas-2BL.2, QYr.caas-2DS.2, QYr.caas-4DL.2 and QYr.caas-5DS, respectively. QYr.caas-2DS.2 andQYr.caas-5DS were detected in all three environments, explaining 2.3-18.2% and 5.1-18.0% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. In addition, QYr.caas-2BS.2 and QYr.caas-2BL.2 colocated with QTL for powdery mildew resistance reported in a previous study. These APR genes and their linked molecular markers are potentially useful for improving stripe rust and powdery mildew resistances in wheat breeding.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) possesses a large and highly repetitive genome of 5.1Gb that has hindered the development of a complete sequence. In 2012, the International Barley Sequencing Consortium released a resource integrating whole-genome shotgun sequences with a physical and genetic framework. However, because only 6278 bacterial artificial chromosome (BACs) in the physical map were sequenced, fine structure was limited. To gain access to the gene-containing portion of the barley genome at high resolution, we identified and sequenced 15622 BACs representing the minimal tiling path of 72052 physical-mapped gene-bearing BACs. This generated 1.7Gb of genomic sequence containing an estimated 2/3 of all Morex barley genes. Exploration of these sequenced BACs revealed that although distal ends of chromosomes contain most of the gene-enriched BACs and are characterized by high recombination rates, there are also gene-dense regions with suppressed recombination. We made use of published map-anchored sequence data from Aegilops tauschii to develop a synteny viewer between barley and the ancestor of the wheat D-genome. Except for some notable inversions, there is a high level of collinearity between the two species. The software HarvEST:Barley provides facile access to BAC sequences and their annotations, along with the barley-Ae.tauschii synteny viewer. These BAC sequences constitute a resource to improve the efficiency of marker development, map-based cloning, and comparative genomics in barley and related crops. Additional knowledge about regions of the barley genome that are gene-dense but low recombination is particularly relevant.

AB A new broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance allele Pm2c was identified and mapped in Chinese wheat landrace Niaomai.
   Chinese wheat landrace Niaomai showed resistance to 27 of 28 Chinese Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) races. Genetic analysis of an F-2 population and its derived F-2:3 families from the cross Niaomai x Mingxian 169 and backcross population, Niaomai/2*Mingxian 169, indicated that the resistance of Niaomai to Bgt races was conferred by a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated PmNM. Molecular tagging showed that PmNM was located on chromosome 5DS and flanked by SSR markers Xcfd81 and Xcfd78 with the genetic distances of 0.1/0.4 cM and 4.9/7.5 cM, respectively. Niaomai showed a different array of responses compared to lines with Pm2a, Pm2b, PmD57-5D, PmLX66, PmX3986-2 and Pm48 genes, sharing the same Xcfd81 allele but differing from Xcfd78 allele for Pm2a and Pm2b lines. Allelism tests based on crosses of Niaomai with Ulka/8*Cc and KM2939 showed that PmNM is allelic to Pm2a and Pm2b. We concluded that PmNM is a new allele of Pm2, re-designated Pm2c. Pm2c could be transferred into wheat cultivars by marker-assisted selection to improve the powdery mildew resistance of breeding cultivars/lines.

AB A novel powdery mildew resistance gene and a new allele of Pm1 were identified and fine mapped. DNA markers suitable for marker-assisted selection have been identified.
   Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat and causes significant yield losses worldwide. Diploid A genome species are an important genetic resource for disease resistance genes. Two powdery mildew resistance genes, identified in Triticum boeoticum (A(b)A(b)) accession pau5088, PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2 were mapped on chromosome 7AL. In the present study, shotgun sequence assembly data for chromosome 7AL were utilised for fine mapping of these Pm resistance genes. Forty SSR, 73 resistance gene analogue-based sequence-tagged sites (RGA-STS) and 36 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were designed for fine mapping of PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2. Twenty-one RGA-STS, 8 SSR and 13 SNP markers were mapped to 7AL. RGA-STS markers Ta7AL-4556232 and 7AL-4426363 were linked to the PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2, at a genetic distance of 0.6 and 6.0 cM, respectively. The present investigation established that PmTb7A.1 is a new powdery mildew resistance gene that confers resistance to a broad range of Bgt isolates, whereas PmTb7A.2 most probably is a new allele of Pm1 based on chromosomal location and screening with Bgt isolates showing differential reaction on lines with different Pm1 alleles. The markers identified to be linked to the two Pm resistance genes are robust and can be used for marker-assisted introgression of these genes to hexaploid wheat.

LA English
DT Article
ID LANDRACES
AB A new stem rust resistance gene Sr49 was mapped to chromosome 5BL of wheat. Usefulness of the closely linked markers sun209 and sun479 for marker-assisted selection of Sr49 was demonstrated.
   Landrace AUS28011 (Mahmoudi), collected from Ghardimaou, Tunisia, produced low stem rust response against Australian pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) carrying virulence for several stem rust resistance genes deployed in modern wheat cultivars. Genetic analysis based on a Mahmoudi/Yitpi F3 population indicated the involvement of a single all-stage stem rust resistance gene and it was temporarily named SrM. Bulked segregant analysis using multiplex-ready SSR technology located SrM on the long arm of chromosome 5B. Since there is no other all-stage stem rust resistance gene located in chromosome 5BL, SrM was permanently designated Sr49. The Mahmoudi/Yitpi F3 population was enhanced to generate F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for detailed mapping of Sr49 using publicly available genomic resources. Markers sun209 and sun479 flanked Sr49 at 1.5 and 0.9 cM distally and proximally, respectively. Markers sun209 and sun479 amplified PCR products different than the Sr49-linked alleles in 146 and 145 common wheat cultivars, respectively. Six and seven cultivars, respectively, carried the resistance-linked marker alleles sun209 (148bp) and sun479 (200bp) ; however, none of the cultivars carried both resistance-linked alleles. These results demonstrated the usefulness of these markers for marker-assisted selection of Sr49 in breeding programs.

AB A genetic analysis of plant characters associated with lodging resistance, yield and other agronomic traits was made on two doubled haploid winter wheat populations grown at two UK locations in the 2004/2005, 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 seasons. Wide genetic variation was found for traits that affect lodging, including plant height, components of stem strength (stem diameter, wall width and material strength), components of anchorage strength (spread and depth of the root plate), ear area and shoot number per plant. Heritabilities were estimated for each of the key lodging traits, with plant height having the highest heritability and anchorage traits the lowest values. Six quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling plant height had individual height effects (2 x the additive effect) of 3-9 cm and taken together, could potentially increase plant height by up to 34 cm. Three of the height QTL were also associated with greater yield or greater thousand grain weight, and three were associated with components of stem strength or anchorage strength. QTL were also identified for each of the measured lodging traits, which were unrelated to height. Individual QTL with the largest estimated effects on lodging resistance were for height, stem diameter, stem material strength, stem failure moment, root plate spread and root plate depth. Diagnostic genetic markers for the most important QTL regions are now required to enable breeders to efficiently combine multiple traits together in a single variety that will increase lodging resistance and yield simultaneously.

AB Powdery mildew (Pm), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most serious diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in many regions of the world. Rapid loss of resistance caused by pathogen virulence requires continual improvement of Pm resistance through utilization of novel resistance genes. Pm07J126, in wheat line 07jian126, is a dominant resistance gene, conferring immunity to the prevailing Bgt population in Sichuan province. Previous studies showed that Pm07J126 might be derived from rye (Secale cereale L.) and that it was closely linked with SSR marker barc183. In this study, we localized Pm07J126 to the distal end of chromosome 6DS based on markers barc183 and cfd135. Collinearity analysis of wheat, Brachypodium and rice helped to identify an sequence tagged site marker in close proximity to barc183 in chromosome bin 6DS6-0.99-1.00. Marker Xcib9 that co-segregated with Pm07J126 should be useful for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Zymoseptoria tritici (synonyms: Mycosphaerella graminicola and Septoria tritici), is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. STB can be managed by fungicide application and by host resistance. The use of fungicides is less effective due to the development of fungal populations resistant to commercially available fungicides. As a result, host plant resistance is considered as one of the best strategies of STB management. In our preliminary study, the spring wheat cultivar 'Largo' showed a high level of resistant to multiple isolates of Z. tritici. The main objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for STB resistance in Largo and DNA markers associated with QTL. The 118 F-7 recombinant-inbred lines were developed from a cross between the synthetic hexaploid wheat Largo and the spring wheat susceptible line ND495 by single-seed descent. Disease severity in the mapping population was assessed at flag leaf stage 21 days after inoculation in the greenhouse at North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND in 2009 and 2010. Approximately, 2500 Diversity Arrays Technology(A (R)) (DArT) markers were used for genetic mapping. Among them, 263 DArT markers were polymorphic and revealed the 37 linkage groups. The new putative QTL (QStb.2A) associated with STB resistance was flanked by the two DArT markers wPt_3896 and wPt_4197, (wPt_4555) and is mapped on chromosome 2A. Single marker analysis also detected three additional DArT markers associated with other QTLs; however, chromosomal locations of these markers are unknown. Our results indicated that the DArT markers identified in this study can be useful for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs and for combing this novel QTL with other STB resistance genes.

AB The bread wheat line WR95 showed seedling resistance to several Indian stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici) isolates. Genetic analysis of stem rust resistance in WR95 was undertaken in populations derived from crosses NI5439/WR95 and Agra Local/WR95. The F-1, F-2, and F-3 generations derived from the cross NI5439/WR95 were tested against stem rust isolate 40A and genetic analysis showed a recessive gene for resistance. The results were confirmed in another F-2 population derived from the cross Agra Local/WR95. Interestingly, genetic analysis in F-2 population from the later cross i.e. Agra Local/WR95 identified a dominant gene against isolates 11 and 11A. The recessive gene against isolate 40A was mapped to the long arm of 5D chromosome. WR95 showed resistance to virulent isolates of Sr30 which is also located on 5DL chromosome. The dominant gene in WR95 that conferred the resistance to isolate 11 and 11A was mapped towards telomeric region of the long arm of 2B chromosome. The long arm of chromosome 2B also carries stem rust resistance genes Sr9, Sr16 and Sr28. WR95 showed resistance to virulent isolates to Sr9b (11, 11A, 21A-2 and 40A), Sr9e (15-1 and 40A) and Sr28 (11, 11A, 15-1, 21A-2 and 40A). The map position of dominant gene identified in WR95 is different from Sr9 and Sr28 while Sr16 is towards telomeric region and not mapped so far. Therefore, the dominant gene in WR95 may be either Sr16 or a new gene.

AB The growth of the leaf blade is one of the limiting factors of the life cycle of a plant. The leaf elongation rate in early plant growth stages is important for plant establishment. The rlb (reduction of leaf blade) mutation in Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 6x = 42, BBAADD genome) caused a severe interruption of leaf blade development, a reduction of spike length and spikelet number, and decreased plant height. The heterozygous plants of the hybrid 'ANK-31' (rlb near-isogenic line of T. aestivum 'Novosibirskaya 67')/Novosibirskaya 67 was used to conserve the rlb trait, since the heterozygous plants were fertile and were characterized by incisions on the leaf edge. The F-2 of ANK-31/T. aestivum 'Chinese Spring' segregated 559 normal leaf: 162 reduction of leaf blade, fitting a 3:1 ratio. This results confirmed that the recessive allele at a single locus controlled the rlb phenotype. Using microsatellite probes, the rlb gene was mapped between Xgwm133 and Xgwm582 in chromosome arm 6DL. We discussed possible use of ANK-31 to find the negative determinants of leaf development.

AB The precise elimination of selectable marker genes is highly desirable, when their function is no longer needed, because their presence raised worldwide public concerns against the release of genetically modified plants. This is the first report of simultaneous application of the minimal gene cassette and cold-inducible Cre/lox recombination system in wheat. The bar selection and cre-recombinase genes were eliminated from T-0 and T-1 transgenic lines with 44 and 51 % efficiency. This approach provides a new, reasonably effective technique to produce selection gene-free transgenic wheat lines either immediately after tissue culture, or from the subsequent transgenic generation. The advantage of this method is that it does not require any additional cold treatment during the plant regeneration/growing because the transgene elimination is ensured by the vernalisation. Application of this method prevents gene flow by pollen and seed, because the selection and recombinase genes are eliminated before pollen development, therefore reducing the risk of GM plants.

AB In the present work, three DNA sequences encoding wheat proteins (alpha 2-gliadin, agglutinin isolectin and thioredoxin h) were compared to trace gluten-containing cereals in food products. Quantitative real-time PCR methods using hydrolysis probes were successfully developed to target the three sequences for the detection of wheat DNA. The comparison of the three systems highlights the best sensitivity when tracing the alpha 2-gliadin marker sequence, showing an absolute limit of detection (LOD) of 2 pg of wheat DNA and a relative LOD of 0.005% (50 mg/kg) of wheat in soybean, which corresponds to 4.5 mg/kg of gluten. All the systems reveal high specificity for detecting other gluten-containing cereals, such as barley and rye. Therefore, the developed real-time PCR systems can be used as non-immunological tools to confirm the presence of gluten-containing cereals in foods, towards the safety of celiac patients and wheat allergic individuals.

AB The origin, evolution, and distribution of cultivated barley provides powerful insights into the historic origin and early spread of agrarian culture. Here, population-based genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the evolution and origin of barley and how domestication and subsequent introgression have affected the genetic diversity and changes in cultivated barley on a worldwide scale. A set of worldwide cultivated and wild barleys from Asia and Tibet of China were analyzed using the sequences for NAM-1 gene and gene-associated traits-grain protein content (GPC). Our results showed Tibetan wild barley distinctly diverged from Near Eastern barley, and confirmed that Tibet is one of the origin and domestication centers for cultivated barley, and in turn supported a polyphyletic origin of domesticated barley. Comparison of haplotype composition among geographic regions revealed gene flow between Eastern and Western barley populations, suggesting that the Silk Road might have played a crucial role in the spread of genes. The GPC in the 118 cultivated and 93 wild barley accessions ranged from 6.73 to 12.35% with a mean of 9.43%. Overall, wild barley had higher averaged GPC (10.44%) than cultivated barley. Two unique haplotypes (Hap2 and Hap7) caused by a base mutations (at position 544) in the coding region of the NAM-1 gene might have a significant impact on the GPC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes of NAM-1 associated with GPC in barley could provide a useful method for screening GPC in barley germplasm. The Tibetan wild accessions with lower GPC could be useful for malt barley breeding.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were undertaken to identify SNP markers associated with yield and yield-related traits in 123 Pakistani historical wheat cultiyars evaluated during 2011-2014 seasons under rainfed field conditions. The population was genotyped by using high-density Illumina iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay, and finally 14,960 high quality SNPs were used in GWAS. Population structure examined using 1000 unlinked markers identified seven subpopulations (K = 7) that were representative of different breeding programs in Pakistan, in addition to local landraces. Forty four stable marker-trait associations (MIAs) with -log p 4 were identified for nine yield-related traits. Nine multi-trait MTAs were found on chromosomes 1AL, 1BS, 2AL, 2BS, 2BL, 4BL, 5BL, 6AL, and 6BL, and those on 5BL and 6AL were stable across two seasons. Gene annotation and syntey identified that 14 trait-associated SNPs were linked to genes haying significant importance in plant development. Favorable alleles for days to heading (DH), plant height (PH), thousand grain weight (TGVV), and grain yield (GY) showed minor additive effects and their frequencies were slightly higher in cultiyars released after 2000. However, no selection pressure on any favorable allele was identified. These genomic regions identified have historically contributed to achieve yield gains from 2.63 million tons in 1947 to 25.7 million tons in 2015. Future breeding strategies can be devised to initiate marker assisted breeding to accumulate these favorable alleles of SNPs associated with yield-related traits to increase grain yield. Additionally, in silico identification of 454-contigs corresponding to MTAs will facilitate fine mapping and subsequent cloning of candidate genes and functional marker development.

AB Background: Molecular marker-assisted breeding provides an efficient tool to develop improved crop varieties. A major challenge for the broad application of markers in marker-assisted selection is that the marker phenotypes must match plant phenotypes in a wide range of breeding germplasm. In this study, we used the legume crop species Lupinus angustifolius (lupin) to demonstrate the utility of whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing on the development of diagnostic markers for molecular plant breeding.
   Results: Nine lupin cultivars released in Australia from 1973 to 2007 were subjected to whole genome re-sequencing. The re-sequencing data together with the reference genome sequence data were used in marker development, which revealed 180,596 to 795,735 SNP markers from pairwise comparisons among the cultivars. A total of 207,887 markers were anchored on the lupin genetic linkage map. Marker mining obtained an average of 387 SNP markers and 87 InDel markers for each of the 24 genome sequence assembly scaffolds bearing markers linked to 11 genes of agronomic interest. Using the R gene PhtjR conferring resistance to phomopsis stem blight disease as a test case, we discovered 17 candidate diagnostic markers by genotyping and selecting markers on a genetic linkage map. A further 243 candidate diagnostic markers were discovered by marker mining on a scaffold bearing non-diagnostic markers linked to the PhtjR gene. Nine out from the ten tested candidate diagnostic markers were confirmed as truly diagnostic on a broad range of commercial cultivars. Markers developed using these strategies meet the requirements for broad application in molecular plant breeding.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that low-cost genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were sufficient and very effective in the development of diagnostic markers for marker-assisted selection. The strategies used in this study may be applied to any trait or plant species. Whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides a powerful tool to overcome current limitations in molecular plant breeding, which will enable plant breeders to precisely pyramid favourable genes to develop super crop varieties to meet future food demands.

AB Facultative/winter six-row malting barley is a distinct elite germplasm pool and a valuable resource that may prove useful in meeting the challenges of climate change. To preserve its diversity and make it accessible to the research and agricultural communities, the Oregon State University and University of Minnesota barley breeding programs are publicly releasing their winter/facultative six-row malt advanced lines named the TCAP FAC-WIN6 (MP-1, NSL 512632 MAP), which also function as a genomewide association studies (GWAS) panel. The FAC-WIN6 contains 296 lines-180 facultative and 116 winter-selected for disease resistance, malt quality, and general agronomic performance. To date, all lines have data for 6892 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and phenotypic data from six experiments (representing 3 yr, eight locations), including traits such as malt quality, disease resistance, nitrogen use efficiency, and winter hardiness. The FAC-WIN6 is one of 24 barley and wheat mapping panels and populations from the USDA-ARS Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (TCAP). As such, all of the TCAP FAC-WIN6 genotypic and phenotypic data can be freely downloaded from the TCAP's online database, T3 (http://triticeaetoolbox.org/barley/). Preliminary GWAS have identified novel loci for wort beta-glucan, low temperature tolerance, and disease resistance. Given these results, the FAC-WIN6 is a singular resource both for future winter six-row barley breeding and for identifying and deploying genes for key barley traits in all backgrounds.

AB Like other eukaryotes, the nuclear genome of plants consists of DNA with a small proportion of low-copy DNA (genes and regulatory sequences) and very abundant DNA sequence motifs that are repeated thousands up to millions of times in the genomes including transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNA. Retrotransposons, one class of TEs, are sequences that amplify via an RNA intermediate and reinsert into the genome, are often the major fraction of a genome. Here, we put research on retrotransposons into the larger context of plant repetitive DNA and genome behaviour, showing features of genome evolution in a grass genus, Brachiaria, in relation to other plant species. We show the contrasting amplification of different retroelement fractions across the genome with characteristics for various families and domains. The genus Brachiaria includes both diploid and polyploid species, with similar chromosome types and chromosome basic numbers x = 6, 7, 8 and 9. The polyploids reproduce asexually and are apomictic, but there are also sexual species. Cytogenetic studies and flow cytometry indicate a large variation in DNA content (C-value), chromosome sizes and genome organization. In order to evaluate the role of transposable elements in the genome and karyotype organization of species of Brachiaria, we searched for sequences similar to conserved regions of TEs in RNAseq reads library produced in Brachiaria decumbens. Of the 9649 TE-like contigs, 4454 corresponded to LTR-retrotransposons, and of these, 79.5 % were similar to members of the gypsy superfamily. Sequences of conserved protein domains of gypsy were used to design primers for producing the probes. The probes were used in FISH against chromosomes of accesses of B. decumbens, Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria ruziziensis and Brachiaria humidicola. Probes showed hybridization signals predominantly in proximal regions, especially those for retrotransposons of the clades CRM and Athila, while elements of Del and Tat exhibited dispersed signals, in addition to those proximal signals. These results show that the proximal region of Brachiaria chromosomes is a hotspot for retrotransposon insertion, particularly for the gypsy family. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and a chromosome-centric cytogenetic approach allows the abundance, organization and nature of transposable elements to be characterized in unprecedented detail. By their amplification and dispersal, retrotransposons can affect gene expression; they can lead to rapid diversification of chromosomes between species and, hence, are useful for studies of genome evolution and speciation in the Brachiaria genus. Centromeric regions can be identified and mapped, and retrotransposon markers can also assisting breeders in the developing and exploiting interspecific hybrids.

TI Leaf Rust Resistance in Wheat Line RL6062 is an Allele at the Lr3 Locus
SO CROP SCIENCE

ID F-SP TRITICI; COMMON WHEAT; SYSTEM; GENE
AB RL6062, a 'Thatcher' backcross line of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), has resistance to leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Erikss.) derived from a line of common wheat from Iran. RL6062 has an intermediate infection type (IT) of small to moderate uredinia surrounded by distinct chlorosis. RL6062 was crossed with Thatcher and the F-2 seedlings and F-3 families segregated for a single leaf rust resistance gene. Bulk segregant analysis of homozygous resistant and homozygous susceptible F-3 families using diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers indicated that the leaf rust resistance was on chromosome 6BL. RL6062 was crossed with Thatcher lines with genes Lr9, Lr3a, Lr3b, and Lr3c that are also located on chromosome 6BL. The F-2 seedlings of RL6010-Lr9/RL6062 segregated for IT that ranged from immune response to high IT with large uredinia that lacked necrosis or chlorosis. The F-3 families derived from F-2 seedlings with high IT were homozygous susceptible or segregated for intermediate IT and high IT, confirming that resistance in RL6062 was not allelic to Lr9. The F-2 seedlings of RL6002-Lr3a/RL6062 segregated for IT that varied from flecks to moderately large size uredinia that lacked chlorosis or necrosis. The F-3 families derived from F-2 seedlings that had intermediate to high IT segregated for low IT of fleck to intermediate IT, and none of the seedlings had high IT. The lack of segregation for susceptible plants in the F-3 families indicated that the leaf rust resistance in RL6062 is an allele at the Lr3 locus. Alleles at the Lr3 locus had intermediate to recessive expression.

AB Grain hardness is an important quality trait that influences product development in wheat. This trait is governed by variation in puroindoline proteins (PINA and PINB). Our study evaluated 551 Indian wheat germ-plasm lines for diversity in Pina and Pinb genes. Eighty-two lines were shortlisted for full length sequencing and grain hardness studies. Sequencing studies identified six unknown alleles: two for the Pina gene and four for the Pinb gene. Five of them were novel with non-synonymous changes in the corresponding amino acid sequences. Identified mutations in the deduced mature proteins and their pre- and pro-peptides influenced the hardness characteristics of the grain. We classified these 82 varieties into different hardness categories with reference to international and Indian systems of classification. The majority of Indian wheat varieties were categorized as hard. This study revealed that unexplored Indian wheat germplasm can be a good source of genetic variability for both Pina and Pinb genes, helping in marker-assisted breeding and in obtaining wheat with different textural properties.

AB Whole-grain wheat (Triticum aestivum L) products provide essential nutrients to humans, but bran attributes may hinder consumption. Differences in grain attributes including flavor/aroma can be identified using the house mouse (Mus musculus L.) as a model system. A potential application of this model system is to identify genes or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring consumption-related traits using genetic mapping. These analyses require a quantitative phenotype to test marker trait associations. Two-choice feeding trials are common in consumption studies, but do not provide an independent, quantitative phenotype. The objective of this study was to examine the use of 'check' varieties against which to compare sample varieties to generate Student's t values for use as phenotypic values. Two checks, which had previously been identified as "Yummy" and "yucky" (Y, y) were compared against each sample variety. The resulting t values provided an independent quantitative phenotype of the sample varieties. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), is an endemic pest in Tunisia and is among the most destructive biotic stresses of commercial cereals. Genes in wheat that confer resistance to this insect provide the most efficient and economical means of crop protection. Yet, attempts to breed for resistant cereal genotypes are hampered by the periodic emergence of virulent pest biotypes that are unaffected by the plant's resistance factors in use. Therefore, it is crucial to undertake permanent surveys in order to establish baseline information on the status of germplasm resources. A survey of infestation was conducted during the growing season 2011/2012, over the four most important cereal-growing provinces of Tunisia (Beja, Jendouba, Kef and Siliana), which highlighted variation in the incidence and severity of attacks between regions and periods of the year. We recorded two intense outbreaks occurring in early March and late April, suggesting that eradication should be applied in the month of February to hinder the development of subsequent generations. Unlike this constancy in the insect biological rhythm, the genetics of its physiological interaction with the cereal host seems to be altered by mutations leading to the development of new virulent strains. When testing 25 cereal genotypes to infestation by Hessian fly in Beja, Jendouba andKef, we found that the bread wheat cultivar 'Salambo 80' was susceptible. This genotype was resistant to Hessian fly in North Tunisia ten years before. In contrast to 'Salambo 80', bread wheat 'Mahon 73' was characterized by stable resistance across different infestation circumstances, indicating that it would provide a solution for breeding against the Hessian fly races currently prevailing in North Tunisia. The herein reported results represent an additional step of a long-termeffort that should be maintained and updated to keep up with the co-evolutionary dynamics associating cereals to their feeding fly, and stay continuously alerted of biotype development.

AB In the spring wheat-growing regions of western Canada, early maturity is an important trait for timely harvest to avoid frost damage, and associated harvest and post-harvest problems. Earliness is genetically regulated by vernalization, photoperiod, earliness per se genes, and complex gene interactions. In this study, we explored the effect of these gene complexes on the expression of 11 agronomic traits in the CDC Teal x CDC Go Canadian western red spring wheat-mapping population. The population of 187 recombinant inbred lines was genotyped with 341 DArT polymorphic markers and a functional Vrn-B1 marker, and phenotyped over 3 years in replicated trials. The dominant allele of Vrn-B1 reduced the number of days to heading, flowering and maturity, and increased leaf color concentration and plant height, but did not affect grain yield in the presence of common genetic backgrounds with dominant Vrn-A1a and Ppd-D1 alleles at two epistatic loci, Vrn-A1 and Ppd-D1. A total of 21 QTLs were identified for all phenotypic traits recorded, except plant height and grain protein content. Two earliness per se QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1A (QEps.dms-1A) and 4A (QEps.dms-4A) in all three growing seasons, contributing 15-27 and 8-10 %, respectively, to the total genetic variation in days to maturity. The two earliness QTLs and Vrn-B1 exhibited additive interaction. Lines carrying dominant alleles at these three loci headed, flowered and matured 1.7, 1.9 and 4 days earlier, respectively, but yielded 0.43 t ha(-1) less than lines with recessive alleles.

AB The Nicotiana tabacum x N. africana cross is a semilethal cross, where greater than 99 % of progeny die in the cotyledonary stage due to an interspecific lethality reaction. The low frequencies of surviving plants are mixtures of maternal tobacco haploids and aneuploid F-1 hybrids. For effective use of surviving haploids in a breeding program, an efficient method is needed to distinguish them from aneuploid hybrids during the seedling stage. The first objective of this research was to investigate the use of N. africana engineered with a green fluorescent protein (gfp) transgene for distinguishing haploids from other surviving plants derived from this cross. Results demonstrated gfp expression to be a useful phenotypic marker for separation of aneuploid hybrids at the seedling stage. Microsatellite marker genotyping, flow cytometry determinations, and chromosome counts resulted in identification of progeny that exhibited intermediate DNA amounts and variable chromosome numbers donated by the N. africana parent. Three individuals with near-haploid DNA content were identified that carried N. africana markers and n = 24 + 2 or n = 24 + 3 chromosomes. The results present evidence of genetic instability in progeny from the N. tabacum x N. africana cross and suggest that, in contrast to previous belief, chromosome elimination may play at least a partial role in the generation of haploids from this cross. Additionally, microsatellite marker genotyping demonstrated a role for a gene or genes located near the end of N. tabacum chromosome H (linkage group 11) in the interspecific lethality reaction.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Resistance is the best way to control the disease. YrSP, a gene originally from 'Spaldings Prolific' wheat and providing resistance to a broad spectrum of races, is used for differentiating striiformis f. sp. tritici races but its chromosomal location is not clear. To map YrSP, a near-isogenic line (AvSYrSPNIL) was backcrossed to the recurrent parent, Avocet S. Genetic analysis of the BC7F1, BC8, BC7F2, and BC7F3 progenies confirmed a single dominant gene for resistance. In total, 182 BC7F2 plants and their derived BC7F3 lines were phenotyped with an avirulent P. striiformis f sp. triad race and genotyped with simple-sequence repeat (SSR), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. A linkage map was constructed with 3 SSR, 17 SNP, and 3 STS markers covering 23.3 centimorgans (cM). Markers IWA638 and dp269 were 0.6 cM proximal and 1.5 cM distal, respectively, to YrSP. The gene was mapped in chromosome bin 2BL-C-0.5, physically within the proximal 50% of the chromosome 2BL arm. Allelism tests based on F-2 phenotypes indicated that YrSP is closely linked to but not allelic with genes Yr5, Yr7, Yr43, Yr44, and Yr53. Infection type data from tests with 10 historical and currently predominant P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races in the United States also demonstrated differences in specificity between YrSP and the other genes. The specificity of YrSP is useful in differentiating P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races and studying the plant pathogen interactions, and the information of chromosomal location of the gene and its tightly linked markers should be useful in developing resistant cultivars when combined with other genes for resistance to stripe rust.

AB Thinopyrum intermedium, which has many useful traits, is valuable for wheat breeding. A new wheat-Thinopyrum addition line, SN100109, was developed from the progeny of common wheat cultivar Yannong 15 and Th. intermedium. It was resistant to most races of Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt), which caused powdery mildew in wheat, and its reactions were different from the reactions of gene Pm40 and Pm43. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular marker analysis were used to identify the genomic composition of SN100109. GISH results showed that SN100109 was a wheat-Th. intermedium disomic addition line containing one pair of J chromosomes, and the resistance gene was located on the alien additional chromosomes of SN100109. And four molecular markers BE425942, BF482714, Xgdm93 and BV679214 which were assigned to homologous group 2, were specific molecular markers of the additional chromosomes. All the results indicated that SN100109 contained one pair of 2J chromosomes. SN100109 can be used as a novel germplasm source for introducing powdery mildew resistance genes to wheat in breeding programs.

AB Leaf senescence is a notably important trait that limits the yield and biomass accumulation of agronomic crops. Therefore, determining the chromosomal position of the expression sequence tags (ESTs) that are associated with leaf senescence is notably interesting in the manipulation of leaf senescence for crop improvement. A total of 32 ESTs that were previously identified during the delaying leaf senescence stage in the stay-green wheat cultivar CN17 were mapped to 42 chromosomes, a chloroplast, a mitochondrion, and a ribosome using in silico mapping. Then, we developed 19 pairs of primers based on these sequences and used them to determine the polymorphisms between the stay-green cultivars (CN12, CN17, and CN18) and the control cultivar MY11. Among the 19 pairs of primers, 5 pairs produced polymorphisms between the stay-green cultivar and the non-stay-green control. Further studies of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomics show that JK738991 is mapped to 3B, JK738983 is mapped to 5D, and JK738989 is mapped to 2A, 4A, and 3D. The other two ESTs, JK738994 and JK739003, were not assigned to a chromosome using the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomics, which indicates that these ESTs may be derived from rye DNA in the wide cross. In particular, the ESTs that produce polymorphisms are notably useful in identifying the stay-green cultivar using molecular marker-assisted selection. The results also suggest that the in silico mapping data, even from a comparison genomic analysis based on the homogeneous comparison, are useful at some points, but the data were not always reliable, which requires further investigation using experimental methods.

AB Plant-model-assisted phenotyping and metabolomics enable phenotypic and genetic dissection of early vigour traits in a rice diversity panel.Early vigour of rice, defined as seedling capacity to accumulate shoot dry weight (SDW) rapidly, is a complex trait. It depends on a genotype propensity to assimilate, store, and/or use non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) for producing large and/or numerous leaves, involving physiological trade-offs in the expression of component traits and, possibly, physiological and genetic linkages. This study explores a plant-model-assisted phenotyping approach to dissect the genetic architecture of rice early vigour, applying the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to morphological and NSC measurements, as well as fitted parameters for the functional-structural plant model, Ecomeristem. Leaf size, number, SDW, and source-leaf NSC concentration were measured on a panel of 123 japonica accessions. The data were used to estimate Ecomeristem genotypic parameters driving organ appearance rate, size, and carbon dynamics. GWAS was performed based on 12 221 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Twenty-three associations were detected at P < 1x10(-4) and 64 at P < 5x10(-4). Associations for NSC and model parameters revealed new regions related to early vigour that had greater significance than morphological traits, providing additional information on the genetic control of early vigour. Plant model parameters were used to characterize physiological and genetic trade-offs among component traits. Twelve associations were related to loci for cloned genes, with nine related to organogenesis, plant height, cell size or cell number. The potential use of these associations as markers for breeding is discussed.

AB A genealogical analysis of accessions in the global gene pool of the wheat database GRIS4.0 showed that the use of the genetic material of Aegilops in wheat breeding began about half a century ago. During this time, more than 1350 varieties and 9000 lines, the pedigree of which contains Aegilops species, were created in different regions of the world. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the distribution of wheat varieties containing the genetic material of Aegilops was investigated. Analysis of the data showed that most commercial varieties with a pedigree including Ae. tauschii and/or Ae. umbellulata were created and grown in North America. More than 70% of the varieties were produced with Ae. ventricosa, which is common in western and central Europe. A gradual increase in the proportion of varieties with Aegilops genetic material was recorded from 1962 to 2011. The percentage of varieties created with the involvement of Ae. umbellulata increased from 1-5% in the 1960s to 25-29% in the 2000s. Those created with Ae. tauschii increased from 0 to 14-18%, and those created with Ae. ventricosa increased from 1 to 34-37%. The increases in the number of these varieties indicates that the resistance genes from Aegilops species retain their effectiveness. Genealogical analysis of the varieties in which resistance genes from Aegilops were postulated revealed that varieties or lines that were sources of identified genes were often absent in the pedigree. This may be due to an incorrect pedigree record or errors in the identification of resistance genes by phytopathological testing and/or the use of molecular markers, or confusion in nurseries. Preliminary analysis of pedigrees provides an opportunity to reveal discrepancies between the pedigree and postulated genes.

AB In the wake of terrorist attacks using anthrax and ricin, white powder is often encountered in cases of malicious mischief and terrorist threats. Wheat flour is a common white powder encountered in such criminal investigations. We used DNA analysis to investigate wheat flour samples for identification and discrimination as trace evidence. Species identification of commercially available wheat flour was carried out by sequencing a partial region of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit gene (rbcL). Samples were discriminated using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. The rbcL sequences of all wheat flour samples were identical and showed a high level of similarity to known wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sequences. Furthermore, flours had characteristic patterns in STR analyses, with specific cultivars showing distinctive patterns. These results suggested that the identification of wheat flour species is possible using rbcL sequencing, and that STR analysis is useful for discriminating between samples.

AB Wheat powdery mildew is caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. The allelic series of the wheat Pm3 gene conferring race-specific resistance against powdery mildew has been well characterized functionally, and recently the corresponding avirulence gene AvrPm3a/f triggering the specific recognition by Pm3a and Pm3f alleles was cloned. Here, we describe the genetic and molecular analysis of two additional Blumeria loci involved in the resistance mediated by the Pm3c and Pm3f alleles. We genetically identified the two loci and mapped at high resolution one locus involved in the avirulence towards both Pm3c and Pm3f. The single candidate gene Bcg1 was identified in a physical target interval of 26 kb defined by flanking genetic markers. Bcg1 encodes a small secreted protein sharing structural homology with ribonucleases and belongs to a family of clustered putative effector genes under diversifying selection. We found a very good, but not complete, correlation of Bcg1 haplotypes with the phenotypes of natural isolates. Two mutants were generated that were affected in their phenotypes towards Pm3a and Pm3f but did not show any sequence polymorphism in Bcg1. Our results suggest that avirulence to Pm3 in Blumeria is determined by a complex network of genes, in which Bcg1 might have a central role as a modifier of the Pm3/AvrPm3 interactions.

AB Grain weight, an essential yield component, is under strong genetic control and at the same time markedly influenced by the environment. Genetic analysis of the thousand grain weight (TGW) by genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with a panel of 358 European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties using phenotypic data of field tests in eight environments. Wide phenotypic variations were indicated for the TGW with BLUEs (best linear unbiased estimations) values ranging from 35.9 to 58.2g with a mean value of 45.4 g and a heritability of H-2 = 0.89. A total of 12 candidate genes for plant height, photoperiodism and grain weight were genotyped on all varieties. Only three candidates, the photoperiodism gene Ppd-D1, dwarfing gene Rht-B1 and the TaGW-6A gene were significant explaining up to 14.4, 2.3, and 3.4% of phenotypic variation, respectively. For a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of TGW-OIL genotyping data from 732 microsatellite markers and a set of 7769 mapped SNP-markers genotyped with the 90k iSELECT array were analyzed. In total, 342 significant (-log(10) (P-value) >= 3.0) marker trait associations (MIAs) were detected for SSR-markers and 1195 MIAs (-log(10)(P-yalue) >= 3.0) for SNP-markers in all single environments plus the BLUEs. After Bonferroni correction, 28 MIAs remained significant for SSR-markers (-log(10) (P-value) >= 4.82) and 58 MIAs for SNP-markers (-log(10) (P-value) >= 5.89). Apart from chromosomes 4B and 6B for SSR-markers and chromosomes 4D and 5D for SNP-markers, MIAs were detected on all chromosomes. The highest number of significant SNP-markers was found on chromosomes 3B and 1B, while for the SSRs most markers were significant on chromosomes 6D and 3D. Overall, TGW was determined by many markers with small effects. Only three SNP-markers had R-2 values above 6%.

AB The melon aphid Aphis gossypii Glover is one of the most serious pests in cucumber production, often causing severe damage in commercial fields. Identifying and deploying resistant germplasm and understanding the inheritance of melon aphid resistance are required for cucumber geneticists to develop an effective breeding strategy. In this study, resistance of 30 cucumber selections to melon aphid was evaluated at the seedling stage. Six generations, P-1, P-2, F-1, BC1, BC2 and F-2 derived from the cross of JY30 (susceptible) x EP6392 (resistant), were used as genetic populations to study the inheritance of melon aphid resistance in cucumber with the mixed major gene plus polygene inheritance model with the joint analysis method of multiple generations. Eight of the 30 tested selections displayed resistance to the melon aphid. The resistance of cucumber to melon aphids was controlled by one additive and dominant major gene plus additive and dominant polygenes, and was affected by environment as well. The additive effect and the dominant effect of the major gene were greater than the additive effect and the dominant effect of the polygenes. The heritabilities of the major gene in BC1, BC2 and F-2 were 63.62 %, 0 % and 70.39 %, respectively. The polygenic heritabilities were 22.62 %, 37.0 % and 9.32 %, and the ratios of the environmental variance to phenotype variance were 58.54 %, 63.16 % and 30.77 %. We conclude that selections of cucumber with high resistance to melon aphid could be screened in advanced generations.

   METAANALYSIS
AB As an important cereal disease in humid and semi-humid areas, Fusarium head blight (FHB) has caused severe epidemics on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in different countries worldwide. By causing both yield loss and quality degradation, FHB presents a two-fold threat to farmers and consumers. Since the beginning of FHB research at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) in the early 1980s, a large-scale FHB screening has been conducted to identify and incorporate new resistance genes into elite CIMMYT germplasm. Candidates of the 15th Fusarium head blight screening nursery (FHBSN) were derived from different CIMMYT wheat breeding programs and were tested for 3 years successively in El Batan, Mexico, before being included in the 15th FHBSN set. From 2010 to 2012, a set of 44 out of 2794 lines were gradually selected depending on their FHB indices, pedigree information, and phenological traits like plant height and days to heading. The performance of these lines varied across years under different disease pressure, but they all showed high level of resistance compared to the susceptible checks. In 2013, the nursery was again evaluated in El Batan, as well as in artificially inoculated field trials in Norway, Uruguay, the Netherlands, and Japan (2014), and in naturally infected experiments in Toluca, Mexico, and Canada. Although not all lines demonstrated strong resistance across environments, promising lines with good FHB resistance can still be identified in each location. The genotypes were haplotyped with PCR-based markers for ten loci on seven chromosomes associated with known FHB resistance, and the results suggested that 24 of the genotypes (55 %) carried the 4BS QTL as in Wuhan 1, which was the most frequent QTL in this nursery, and the 7A QTL as in T. dicoccoides was noticed in five (11 %) of the genotypes. The resistance QTLs on chromosomes 3B, 5A and 6B as in Sumai 3 and 3A as in T. dicoccoides were not detected in any of the genotypes denoting the uniqueness of these lines. Fifteen (34 %) of the genotypes may not carry any of the ten QTLs examined. The results provide valuable information that could be successfully utilized by breeders to select resistant parents for crosses since novel resistance sources were detected for better targeted crosses toward diversifying and/or pyramiding FHB resistance.

AB One of the important approaches for disease control in sugarcane is to develop a disease-resistant variety; this may be accomplished through identification of resistance genes in sugarcane. In this study, PCR primers targeting the conserved motifs of the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) class and kinase class of the resistance gene analogues (RGAs) were used to amplify the RGAs from a red rot-resistant sugarcane cultivar (Saccharum spp. hybrid) HSF 240. Upon subcloning and sequencing, fifteen putative RGAs were identified. These RGAs shared 63-98% identity to the reported disease-resistant genes in the NCBI GenBank database. Deduced amino acid sequences also showed the presence of expected conserved domains characteristic of RGAs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these RGAs clustered with R genes from other plant species. The findings will be useful for studying disease-resistant genes in sugarcane.

AB Stripe rust (or yellow rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating fungal disease of common wheat. Wheat line P9897 showed adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust for several years. To map resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL), F-2:3 lines from a cross of P9897 with susceptible Mingxiang 169 were phenotyped for stripe rust response in replicated field trials in 2013. Resistance gene analog polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers were used to identify markers linked to the resistance QTL. Two QTL, QYr.nafu-2BL and QYr.nafu-3BS conferring APR to stripe rust, were mapped to 8.8 and 3.3 cM intervals on chromosome 2BL and 3BL, respectively. QYr.nafu-2BL is likely a new APR gene for resistance to stripe rust, and QYr.nafu-3BS is likely the same locus as previously identified QYr.uga-3BS.1. These QTL with linked markers could be used in developing wheat cultivars with stripe rust resistance.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Aegilops tauschii, the diploid D genome progenitor of the hexaploid wheat, has been used to improve modern common wheat by creating synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) as a bridging mechanism for wheat breeding. Most Ae. tauschii accessions have hairiness on the leaf sheath, whereas the hexaploid common wheat is usually glabrous. In this study a major QTL for leaf sheath hairiness (LSH) was detected on the long arm of chromosome 4D in two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations produced from SHW-derived cultivar Chuanmai 42. The QTL peak was flanked by markers Xbarc48 and Xbarc1183/D_GB5Y7FA01AGCKH_224, and explained more than 75 % of the phenotypic variation. The QTL allele for LSH was contributed by Chuanmai 42, and originated from Ae. tauschii. In both RIL populations the QTL allele producing hairy leaf sheath was significantly and positively associated with increased grain yield, grain weight and grain weight per spike. Moreover, most Chuanmai 42-derived cultivars have inherited the hairy leaf sheath character. These findings suggest that the hairy leaf sheath gene in Chuanmai 42 can be applied in marker-assisted selection (MAS) as a morphologically selectable marker in breeding for high yield.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting in spring wheat causes significant financial loss to growers throughout the world and sprouting damage can be reduced by growing resistant genotypes. Several genetic factors, especially those related to seed dormancy, are involved in the control of pre-harvest sprouting resistance. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing pre-harvest sprouting resistance from multiple measures of dormancy at multiple germination intervals on seed harvested across multiple environments. A doubled haploid mapping population of 91 individuals derived from a cross of two Canadian white-seeded spring wheat genotypes, SC8021-V2 (pre-harvest sprouting resistant) and AC Karma (moderately susceptible to pre-harvest sprouting) was used for QTL mapping. Daily germination counts were analysed using germination index, germination resistance and percent germination at intervals of 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days from spike samples collected from six field and one greenhouse environments in Saskatchewan, Canada. Continuous frequency distributions at certain measure-durations indicated genetic complexity of dormancy segregation in the SC8021-V2/AC Karma cross. Composite interval mapping detected significant (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) QTL associated with resistance to pre-harvest sprouting on all 21 wheat chromosomes. Of the 26 total QTL, six were novel and the rest were detected either at the same marker or overlapping a marker interval reported in other studies. QTL expressed consistently for germination index, germination resistance and percent germination at different germination durations on chromosomes 2B, 4A, 5D and 6D. QTL identified on homoeologous chromosomes 4A, 4B and 4D with chromosome specific molecular variants of SSR marker wmc617 suggest a conserved region for controlling dormancy on group four. The majority of QTL mapped in regions known to contain factors affecting different components of pre-harvest sprouting resistance like seed dormancy, seed coat colour, ABA responsiveness and alpha-amylase activity. This study demonstrated that using multiple measures of seed dormancy at multiple intervals of germination enhanced identification of QTL affecting dormancy in white-seeded hexaploid wheat.

AB Background: Mapping and map-based cloning of genes that control agriculturally and economically important traits remain great challenges for plants with complex highly repetitive genomes such as those within the grass tribe, Triticeae. Mapping limitations in the Triticeae are primarily due to low frequencies of polymorphic gene markers and poor genetic recombination in certain genetic regions. Although the abundance of repetitive sequence may pose common problems in genome analysis and sequence assembly of large and complex genomes, they provide repeat junction markers with random and unbiased distribution throughout chromosomes. Hence, development of a high-throughput mapping technology that combine both gene-based and repeat junction-based markers is needed to generate maps that have better coverage of the entire genome.
   Results: In this study, the available genomics resource of the diploid Aegilop tauschii, the D genome donor of bread wheat, were used to develop genome specific markers that can be applied for mapping in modern hexaploid wheat. A NimbleGen array containing both gene-based and repeat junction probe sequences derived from Ae. tauschii was developed and used to map the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and deletion bin lines of the D genome chromosomes. Based on these mapping data, we have now anchored 5,171 repeat junction probes and 10,892 gene probes, corresponding to 5,070 gene markers, to the delineated deletion bins of the D genome. The order of the gene-based markers within the deletion bins of the Chinese Spring can be inferred based on their positions on the Ae. tauschii genetic map. Analysis of the probe sequences against the Chinese Spring chromosome sequence assembly database facilitated mapping of the NimbleGen probes to the sequence contigs and allowed assignment or ordering of these sequence contigs within the deletion bins. The accumulated length of anchored sequence contigs is about 155 Mb, representing similar to 3.2 % of the D genome. A specific database was developed to allow user to search or BLAST against the probe sequence information and to directly download PCR primers for mapping specific genetic loci.
   Conclusions: In bread wheat, aneuploid stocks have been extensively used to assign markers linked with genes/traits to chromosomes, chromosome arms, and their specific bins. Through this study, we added thousands of markers to the existing wheat chromosome bin map, representing a significant step forward in providing a resource to navigate the wheat genome. The database website (http://probes.pw.usda.gov/ATRJM/) provides easy access and efficient utilization of the data. The resources developed herein can aid map-based cloning of traits of interest and the sequencing of the D genome of hexaploid wheat.

AB Rats develop hyperalgesia and allodynia in the hind paw after L5 spinal nerve ligation. Phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (pERK) was used as a pain marker to investigate the potential role of adjacent uninjured L4 nerve in the development of heat hyperalgesia after L5 nerve injury. Left L5 nerve was ligated and sectioned in rats. Three days later, rats were randomly assigned to five groups; each had both hind paws immersed in water at different temperatures (no heat, 37, 42, 47, and 52 degrees C) under sevoflurane anesthesia for 2 minutes. Five minutes after stimulation the rats were sacrificed and sections of L3-L6 spinal segments were stained immunocytochemically with pERK antibody. pERK immunoreactivity, which is not detectable in the normal spinal cord, was discernible in neurons (not glia) of the superficial dorsal horn after noxious heat stimuli. pERK-positive neurons clearly overlapped in laminae I-II with normal unmyelinated and thin myelinated afferents labeled with calcitonin gene-related peptide and isolectin B4, and injured unmyelinated afferents labeled with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. There was a linear increase in pERK immunoreactivity on both sides with an increase in temperature. Importantly, the number of positive pERK neurons was significantly higher in the ipsilateral side of L4 spinal segment, which receives innervation from uninjured L4 nerve, compared with the contralateral control side, which receives both uninjured L4 and L5 spinal nerves. The data demonstrate that the uninjured L4 nerve plays an important role in the development of heat hyperalgesia at the spinal cord level after L5 nerve injury. J. Comp. Neurol. 523:1731-1747, 2015.

AB Background: A complete genome sequence is an essential tool for the genetic improvement of wheat. Because the wheat genome is large, highly repetitive and complex due to its allohexaploid nature, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) chose a strategy that involves constructing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical maps of individual chromosomes and performing BAC-by-BAC sequencing. Here, we report the construction of a physical map of chromosome 6B with the goal of revealing the structural features of the third largest chromosome in wheat.
   Results: We assembled 689 informative BAC contigs (hereafter reffered to as contigs) representing 91 % of the entire physical length of wheat chromosome 6B. The contigs were integrated into a radiation hybrid (RH) map of chromosome 6B, with one linkage group consisting of 448 loci with 653 markers. The order and direction of 480 contigs, corresponding to 87 % of the total length of 6B, were determined. We also characterized the contigs that contained a part of the nucleolus organizer region or centromere based on their positions on the RH map and the assembled BAC clone sequences. Analysis of the virtual gene order along 6B using the information collected for the integrated map revealed the presence of several chromosomal rearrangements, indicating evolutionary events that occurred on chromosome 6B.
   Conclusions: We constructed a reliable physical map of chromosome 6B, enabling us to analyze its genomic structure and evolutionary progression. More importantly, the physical map should provide a high-quality and map-based reference sequence that will serve as a resource for wheat chromosome 6B.

AB Introduction
   Salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting crop production via adverse effects of osmotic stress, specific ion toxicity, and stress-related nutritional disorders. Detrimental effects of salinity are also often exacerbated by low oxygen availability when plants are grown under waterlogged conditions. Developing salinity-tolerant varieties is critical to overcome these problems, and molecular marker assisted selection can make breeding programs more effective.
   Methods
   In this study, a double haploid (DH) population consisting of 175 lines, derived from a cross between a Chinese barley variety Yangsimai 1 (YSM1) and an Australian malting barley variety Gairdner, was used to construct a high density molecular map which contained more than 8,000 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Salinity tolerance of parental and DH lines was evaluated under drained (SalinityD) and waterlogged (SalinityW) conditions at two different sowing times.
   Results
   Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) located on chromosome 1H, single QTL located on chromosomes 1H, 2H, 4H, 5H and 7H, were identified to be responsible for salinity tolerance under different environments. Waterlogging stress, daylight length and temperature showed significant effects on barley salinity tolerance. The QTL for salinity tolerance mapped on chromosomes 4H and 7H, QSlwd. YG.4H, QSlwd.YG. 7H and QSlww.YG.7H were only identified in winter trials, while the QTL on chromosome 2H QSlsd.YG.2H and QSlsw.YG.2H were only detected in summer trials. Genes associated with flowering time were found to pose significant effects on the salinity QTL mapped on chromosomes 2H and 5H in summer trials. Given the fact that the QTL for salinity tolerance QSlsd.YG.1H and QSlww.YG.1H-1 reported here have never been considered in the literature, this warrants further investigation and evaluation for suitability to be used in breeding programs.

AB Background: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) is an allohexaploid with a huge genome. Due to the presence of extensive homoeologs and paralogs, generating locus-specific sequences can be challenging, especially when a large number of sequences are required. Traditional methods of generating locus-specific sequences are rather strenuous and time-consuming if large numbers of sequences are to be handled.
   Results: To improve the efficiency of isolating sequences for targeted loci, a time-saving and high-throughput pipeline integrating orthologous sequence alignment, genomic sequence retrieving, and multiple sequence alignment was developed. This pipeline was successfully employed in retrieving and aligning homoeologous sequences and 83% of the primers designed based on the pipeline successfully amplified fragments from the targeted subgenomes.
   Conclusions: The high-throughput pipeline developed in this study makes it feasible to efficiently identify locus-specific sequences for large numbers of sequences. It could find applications in all research projects where locus-specific sequences are required. In addition to generating locus-specific markers, the pipeline was also used in our laboratory to identify differentially expressed genes among the three subgenomes of bread wheat. Importantly, the pipeline is not only valuable for research in wheat but should also be applicable to other allopolyploid species.

AB Rye (Secale cereale L.) possesses many valuable genes that can be used for improving disease resistance, yield and environment adaptation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, the documented resistance stocks derived from rye is faced severe challenge due to the variation of virulent isolates in the pathogen populations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop desirable germplasm and search for novel resistance gene sources against constantly accumulated variation of the virulent isolates. In the present study, a new wheat-rye line designated as WR49-1 was produced through distant hybridization and chromosome engineering protocols between common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and rye cultivar German White. Using sequential GISH (genomic in situ hybridization), mc-FISH (multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization), mc-GISH (multicolor GISH) and EST (expressed sequence tag)-based marker analysis, WR49-1 was proved to be a new wheat-rye 6R disomic addition line. As expected, WR49-1 showed high levels of resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) pathogens prevalent in China at the adult growth stage and 19 of 23 Bgt isolates tested at the seedling stage. According to its reaction pattern to different Bgt isolates, WR49-1 may possess new resistance gene(s) for powdery mildew, which differed from the documented powdery mildew gene, including Pm20 on chromosome arm 6RL of rye. Additionally, WR49-1 was cytologically stable, had improved agronomic characteristics and therefore could serve as an important bridge for wheat breeding and chromosome engineering.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a globally serious disease adversely affecting wheat production. The Bgt-resistant wheat breeding line CH09W89 was derived after backcrossing a Bgt resistant wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium partial amphiploid TAI7045 with susceptible wheat cultivars. At the seedling stage, CH09W89 exhibited immunity or high resistance to Bgt pathotypes E09, E20, E21, E23, E26, Bg1, and Bg2, similar to its donor line TAI7045 and Th. intermedium. No Th. intermedium chromatin was detected based on genomic in situ hybridization of mitotic chromosomes. To determine the mode of inheritance of the Bgt resistance and the chromosomal location of the resistance gene, CH09W89 was crossed with two susceptible wheat cultivars. The results of the genetic analysis showed that the adult resistance to Bgt E09 in CH09W89 was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was tentatively designated as pmCH89. Two polymorphic SSR markers, Xwmc310 and Xwmc125, were linked to the resistance gene with genetic distances 3.1 and 2.7 cM, respectively. Using the Chinese Spring aneuploid and deletion lines, the resistance gene and its linked markers were assigned to chromosome arm 4BL in the bin 0.68-0.78. Due to its unique position on chromosome 4BL, pmCH89 appears to be a new locus for resistance to powdery mildew. These results will be of benefit for improving powdery mildew resistance in wheat breeding programs.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of wheat in the Great Plains and southeastern United States. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred means for managing stripe rust, but new virulence in the pathogen population overcomes some of the resistance. The objectives of this study were to characterize the stripe rust resistance in contemporary soft and hard red winter wheat cultivars, to characterize the virulence of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates based on the resistances found in the cultivars, and to determine wheat breeders' perceptions on the importance and methods for achieving stripe rust resistance. Seedlings of cultivars were susceptible to recent isolates, indicating they lacked effective all-stage resistance. However, adult-plants were resistant or susceptible depending on the isolate, indicating they had race-specific adult-plant resistance. Using isolates collected from 1990 to 2013, six major virulence patterns were identified on adult plants of twelve cultivars that were selected as adult-plant differentials. Race-specific adult-plant resistance appears to be the only effective type of resistance protecting wheat from stripe rust in eastern United States. Among wheat breeders, the importance of incorporating stripe rust resistance into cultivars ranged from high to low depending on the frequency of epidemics in their region, and most sources of stripe rust resistance were either unknown or already overcome by virulence in the pathogen population. Breeders with a high priority for stripe rust resistance made most of their selections based on adult-plant reactions in the field, whereas breeders with a low priority for resistance based selections on molecular markers for major all-stage resistance genes.

AB Previous studies on the relationship of barberry (Berberis spp.) and wheat stem rust suggested that, although some barberry species can serve as alternate hosts for the stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, barberry plants play no role in wheat stem rust development and virulence variation of P. graminis f. sp. tritici in China. In the present study, severe rust infections on Berberis shensiana, B. brachypoda, B. potaninii, B. soulieana, and B. aggregata were observed during field surveys in 2011 and 2012. Through artificial inoculation of wheat seedlings ('Mingxian 169') under greenhouse conditions with aeciospores from naturally infected barberry plants, 185 isolates of P. graminis f. sp. tritici were obtained. From the 27 selected isolates that were tested on a set of wheat genotypes used to differentiate P. graminis f. sp. tritici races in China, 18 races were identified, of which 8 races were new and others were of Chinese 21 and 34 race groups. In addition to the information of virulence or avirulence patterns on the Chinese differentials, none of the races were virulent to resistance gene Sr31. The virulence frequencies based on individual Sr genes or differentials ranged from 0 to 96%. Using molecular markers for P. graminis f. sp. tritici, 75 of 4,036 samples of single aecia were identified as P. graminis f. sp. tritici. The low detectable rate of P. graminis f. sp. tritici was verified based on both infection and molecular marker tests. This observation may be correlated with the low levels of wheat stem lust in the surveyed regions. This study shows that P. graminis f. sp. tritici can produce new races through sexual reproduction on Berberis spp. in China.

AB Wheat powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) can be effectively managed by growing resistant cultivars. 'Liangxing 66' and 'Wennong 14' are the current winter wheat cultivars grown in northern China where powdery mildew is epidemic. Both cultivars have been demonstrated to carry single dominant genes for resistance to powdery mildew, tentatively designated PmLX66 and PrnW14, on chromosome 5DS and share common linked markers with Pm2. Allelism tests were performed using a total of 15,657 plants of F-2 segregating populations to determine the relationship between PmLX66, PmW14, and Pm2. All progeny from the crosses Liangxing 66 x 'Ulka/8*Chancellor (Ulka/8*Cc), Wennong 14 x Ulka/8*Cc, and Liangxing 66 x Wennong 14 were resistant when tested with B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate E20, indicating that PmLX66 and PmW14 are allelic to Pm2 and to each other. Liangxing 66 was resistant to 76.7% of the 60 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates from northern China, a slightly smaller proportion than Ulka/8*Cc (78.3%). However, Wennong 14 (85.0%) was more resistant against this set of B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates than Ulka/8*Cc and Liangxing 66. Liangxing 66 and Wennong 14 differed from Ulka/8*Cc in respect to a number of B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates. Based on these findings, PmLX66 and PmW14 are new alleles at the Pm2 locus.

AB The Kenyan wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 'Kenya Kongoni' exhibits high levels of adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (LR) and yellow rust (YR). We determined the genomic regions associated with LR and YR resistance in a population of 148 recombinant inbred lines generated from a cross between 'Avocet-YrA' and Kenya Kongoni. Field experiments to characterize APR to LR and YR were conducted in four and two Mexican or Uruguayan environments, respectively. A linkage map was constructed with 438 diversity arrays technology and 16 simple-sequence repeat markers by JoinMap 4.1 software. Genetic analyses showed that resistance to both rusts was determined by four to five APR genes, including Lr46/Yr29 and Sr2/Lr27/Yr30. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis indicated that pleiotropic APR loci QYLr.cim-1BL corresponding to Lr46/Yr29 and QYLr.cim-7BL that is a putative novel QTL accounted for 5 to 57% and 12 to 35% of the phenotypic variation for resistance to LR and YR, respectively. These loci, in combination with another three LR QTL and two YR QTL, respectively, conferred high levels of resistance to both LR and YR in wheat under Mexican and Uruguayan environments. Among other detected QTL, QLr.cim-1DS, QLr.cim-2BL, and QYLr.icm-7BL may be new loci for APR to both rusts in common wheat.

AB The emergence and spread of the Ug99 race group of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici) in the past decade have exposed the vulnerability of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to this disease. Discovery of novel and effective sources of resistance is vital for breeding resistant varieties to avert losses. The experimental breeding lineMN06113-8 and cultivar RB07 developed by the University of Minnesota wheat breeding program exhibited adult plant resistance (APR) to the Ug99 race group in field tests in Kenya and Ethiopia. Both lines were found to be susceptible at the seedling stage to isolates of the race TTKSK, TTKST, and TTTSK. To dissect the genetic mechanism of resistance present in these lines, MN06113-8 was crossed to RB07 to generate 141 F-6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The RIL population was evaluated for APR to Ug99 in Kenya and Ethiopia over three seasons and for resistance to North American stem rust pathogen races in St. Paul, MN, in one season. The population was genotyped using high-throughput SNP genotyping assays. Composite interval mapping detected six quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in APR to African stem rust races and three QTLs involved in stem rust resistance to North American stem rust races. One QTL located on chromosome 2B was associated with APR to stem rust races in all environments. Development of diagnostic markers linked to this gene will facilitate marker-assisted selection of resistant lines to develop varieties with enhanced levels of stem rust resistance.

AB Barley can be classified into three major agronomic types, based on its seasonal growth habit (SGH): spring, winter and alternative. Winter varieties require exposure to vernalization to promote subsequent flowering and are autumn-sown. Spring varieties proceed to flowering in the absence of vernalization and are sown in the spring. The 'alternative' (also known as 'facultative') SGH is only loosely defined and can be sown in autumn or spring. Here, we investigate the molecular genetic basis of alternative barley. Analysis of the major barley vernalization (VRN-H1, VRN-H2) and photoperiod (PPD-H1, PPD-H2) response genes in a collection of 386 varieties found alternative SGH to be characterized by specific allelic combinations. Spring varieties possessed spring loci at one or both of the vernalization response loci, combined with long-day non-responsive ppd-H1 alleles and wild-type alleles at the short-day photoperiod response locus, PPD-H2. Winter varieties possessed winter alleles at both vernalization loci, in combination with the mutant ppd-H2 allele conferring delayed flowering under short-day photoperiods. In contrast, all alternative varieties investigated possessed a single spring allele (either at VRN-H1 or at VRN-H2) combined with mutant ppd-H2 alleles. This allelic combination is found only in alternative types and is diagnostic for alternative SGH in the collection studied. Analysis of flowering time under controlled environment found alternative varieties flowered later than spring control lines, with the difference most pronounced under short-day photoperiods. This work provides genetic characterization of the alternative SGH phenotype, allowing precise manipulation of SGH and flowering time within breeding programmes, and provides the molecular tools for classification of all three SGH categories within national variety registration processes.

AB Head smut is a soil-borne systemic maize disease caused by the causal pathogen Sporisorium reiliana. ZmWAK is the gene within the major QTL qHSR1 conferring resistance to head smut disease. ZmWAK has been transferred by marker-assisted backcrossing into elite inbred lines with high-yield potential but susceptible to head smut. The converted inbred lines, together with their hybrids, were grown in 2012 and 2013 to investigate resistance performance, yield per plot, and yield-related traits. ZmWAK-mediated resistance to maize head smut follows a dominant genetic model, and a single ZmWAK allele could achieve high disease resistance to prevent yield loss from S. reiliana infection. Genetically, ZmWAK itself had no detectable negative impacts on yield-related traits. Instead, ZmWAK could indirectly improve most yield components, particularly ear-related traits, in symptomless plants by reducing the amount of endophytic S. reiliana. Overall, ZmWAK is beneficial to both head smut resistance and yield-related traits in maize.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a destructive foliar disease of wheat worldwide. Sustainable control of the disease is preferably achieved by deploying stripe rust resistance genes in wheat cultivars. Our previous studies have shown that Baidatou, a Chinese wheat landrace, displayed good adult-plant resistance (APR) to wheat stripe rust in Gansu Province, an epidemic region for stripe rust in China. To elucidate the genetic basis of APR to stripe rust in Baidatou, a cross between Baidatou and Mingxian 169, which is susceptible to all the known Chinese (Pst) races, was performed. Adult plants of F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 generations derived from the cross Mingxian 169/Baidatou were inoculated in the field with the most prevalent Chinese Pst race, CYR33, in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, during 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 crop seasons, respectively. The results showed that the resistance of Baidatou to stripe rust was conferred by a single dominant gene. Six hundred and sixty simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 128 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were screened for association with the resistance gene to stripe rust using bulked segregant analysis. Four polymorphic SSR markers and two SRAP markers were identified to be linked to the resistance gene. A linkage map was constructed with six molecular markers and the resistance gene. The genetic distance of two flanking SSR markers to the resistance gene, temporarily designated YrBai, was 3.6 and 5.4 cM, respectively. Based on the position of the SSR markers on the wheat chromosome, YrBai was located on chromosome 6DS. According to the rust reaction patterns, SSR marker allele analysis and the pedigree of the Yr genes on chromosome 6D, YrBai is likely to be a novel APR gene against stripe rust. The specificity of the two flanking markers of YrBai was validated in 99 wheat germplasms. The gene and its flanking markers should be useful for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance.

AB Repeated blocks in the TaALMT1 promoter as well as a transposon insertion in the TaMATE1B upstream region have been correlated with the level of gene expression, organic acid efflux, and ultimately aluminum (Al3+) resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, we investigated the allelic polymorphism related to the TaALMT1 and TaMATE1B promoter regions in 300 Brazilian wheat genotypes and the correlation of that variation with root growth on acid soil. In addition, SSR markers were used to determine the genetic variability of the genotypes. Seven TaALMT1 promoter alleles (Types I-VII) were detected based on size of PCR products. The most common alleles were Type V and Type VI (71.3 and 11.9 %, respectively), and these are generally associated with higher levels of TaALMT1 expression and Al3+ resistance. The promoter alleles Type I and Type II, which are usually associated with Al3+ sensitivity, were detected in 12.2 % of the genotypes. The insertion in the TaMATE1B promoter, associated with greater Al3+ resistance, was identified in 80 genotypes. Combination among the alleles allowed the separation in 12 haplotypes were 68 genotypes presented the TaALMT1 promoters Type V and Type VI along with the transposon insertion in the TaMATE1B promoter. However, the most represented haplotype was Type V without the insertion (176 genotypes). Short-term soil experiment, performed in 33 genotypes representing the 12 haplotypes, revealed that the higher relative root length was observed in some genotypes presenting TaALMT1 promoters Type V or Type VI and the transposon insertion in the TaMATE1B promoter. Moreover, when comparing genotypes inside the same haplotype, the transposon insertion was significantly advantageous for a few materials. However, the majority the genotypes presenting the insertion in the TaMATE1B promoter did not outperform the genotypes without the insertion but showing the same TaALMT1 promoter. Analysis using SSR markers, with an average PIC of 0.60, showed high genetic diversity among the genotypes belonging to different haplotypes. The alleles and the genetically diverse genotypes reported here should be considered for wheat-breeding programs aiming increments in wheat Al3+ resistance.

AB VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) is a central regulator of the vernalization requirement, which affects the yield and geographical distribution of Triticeae crops through regulation of the flowering time. The first intron (Intron I) of VRN1 contains putative cis-elements that mediate repression of VRN1 expression. Allelic variations in Intron I are closely associated with increased VRN1 expression in vernalization-responsive accessions in the absence of vernalization. In this study, diagnostic molecular markers were developed to distinguish the main 12 known alleles, including a new allele, of barley (Hordeum vulgare) VRN1 (HvVRN1), and to investigate HvVRN1 alleles in 373 barley varieties from major agroecological regions in China. The new allele, HvVRN1-11, with a 3172-bp deletion in Intron I of HvVRN1, was identified in a Chinese barley landrace. Analysis of eight polymorphic sites flanking major variations in Intron I of HvVRN1 classified the 12 HvVRN1 alleles into five distinct groups. Compared with modern commercial barley, landraces possessed greater genetic diversity and contained the majority of HvVRN1 alleles, especially in the winter barley regions. HvVRN1 diversity in terms of allele number reduced significantly (P < 0.01) along with higher growing latitudes, but increased in accessions carrying the winter HvVRN2 allele. Wild-type HvVRN1 and the HvVRN1-8 allele showed the most widespread distribution in most regions whereas HvVRN1-1 & HvVRN1-8, and HvVRN1-5 are predominant in the Inner Mongolian Plateau spring barley region and the Northeast Plain spring barley region, respectively, with relatively higher latitudes. Compared with landraces, the frequency of HvVRN1-8 decreased while wild-type HvVRN1 increased significantly (P < 0.01) in commercial varieties. Our study classified HvVRN1 genetic diversity in a large collection of Chinese germplasm and provided a tool for identifying HvVRN1 alleles in barley breeding populations.

AB Rhizosheaths comprise soil that adheres to plant roots and, in some species, are indicative of root hair length. In this study, the genetics of rhizosheath size in wheat was investigated by screening the progeny of multiparent advanced generation intercrosses (MAGIC). Two MAGIC populations were screened for rhizosheath size using a high throughput method. One MAGIC population was developed from intercrosses between four parents (4-way) and the other from intercrosses between eight parents (8-way). Transgressive segregation for rhizosheath size was observed in both the 4-way and 8-way MAGIC populations. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the 4-way population identified six major loci located on chromosomes 2B, 4D, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 7A together accounting for 42% of the variation in rhizosheath size. Rhizosheath size was strongly correlated with root hair length and was robust across different soil types in the absence of chemical constraints. Rhizosheath size in the MAGIC populations was a reliable surrogate for root hair length and, therefore, the QTL identified probably control root hair elongation. Members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors have previously been identified to regulate root hair length in Arabidopsis and rice. Since several wheat members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of genes are located within or near the QTL, these genes are candidates for controlling the long root hair trait. The QTL for rhizosheath size identified in this study provides the opportunity to implement marker-assisted selection to increase root hair length for improved phosphate acquisition in wheat.

AB Spike number per unit area, number of grains per spike, and thousand-kernel weight (TKW) are important yield components for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). TKW has the highest heritability among the three components. We validated 27 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci associated with TKW in an F-2:5 breeding population grown in four environments. A cfd78(265bp) marker on chromosome 5DS showed the strongest association with TKW and had a significantly positive effect on TKW compared to allele cfd78(259bp), with mean increases of 5.17, 3.63, 4.11, and 5.16g in the four environments. Markers cfd67 and cfd40 flanking cfd78 also showed significantly positive associations with TKW with increases of 5.11, 3.29, 4.31, and 4.50g for cfd67(205), and 4.98, 3.49, 4.06, and 4.84g for cfd40(187) compared with cfd67(203)and cfd40(190) in the four environments, respectively. A major quantitative trait locus for TKW spanning 2.94 cM on chromosome 5DS was detected by association mapping. Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2)>0.2) was detected among the three linked markers, which formed three haplotype blocks in the F-2:5 breeding population. Mean TKW differences between HapB-I and HapB-II were 5.80, 4.41, 4.02, and 5.06g in the four environments, respectively. Moreover, significant LD was detected only between cfd78 and cfd67 and between cfd67 and cfd40 in a germplasm collection. This study provides a base for cloning genes related to TKW on chromosome 5DS.

AB Background and Aims Aegilops markgrafii (CC) and its natural hybrids Ae. triuncialis ((UUCCt)-U-t-C-t-C-t) and Ae. cylindrica ((DDCCc)-D-c-C-c-C-c) represent a rich reservoir of useful genes for improvement of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), but the limited information available on their genome structure and the shortage of molecular (cyto-) genetic tools hamper the utilization of the extant genetic diversity. This study provides the complete karyotypes in the three species obtained after fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA probes, and evaluates the potential of flow cytometric chromosome sorting.
   Methods The flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained chromosomes were characterized and the chromosome content of the peaks on the flow karyotypes was determined by FISH. Twenty-nine conserved orthologous set (COS) markers covering all seven wheat homoeologous chromosome groups were used for PCR with DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA.
   Key Results FISH with repetitive DNA probes revealed that chromosomes 4C, 5C, 7C(t), T6U(t)S.6U(t)L-5C(t)L, 1C(c) and 5D(c) could be sorted with purities ranging from 66 to 91 %, while the remaining chromosomes could be sorted in groups of 2-5. This identified a partial wheat-C-genome homology for group 4 and 5 chromosomes. In addition, 1C chromosomes were homologous with group 1 of wheat; a small segment from group 2 indicated 1C-2C rearrangement. An extensively rearranged structure of chromosome 7C relative to wheat was also detected.
   Conclusions The possibility of purifying Aegilops chromosomes provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops C genome and to develop molecular tools to facilitate the identification of alien chromatin and support alien introgression breeding in bread wheat.

AB The present study aimed to compare the potential anti-adipogenic effects and underlying mechanisms of the luteolin, isoscoparin and isoorientin flavonoids, purified from Triticum aestivum sprout (TA) in 3T3-L1 cells. The cells were treated with different concentrations of flavonoids for 8 days and the lipid accumulation was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. The expression levels of the transcription factors and the genes involved in adipogenesis in the cells were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results demonstrated that 10 mu M luteolin, isoscoparin or isoorientin inhibited lipid deposition in the cells by 74, 63 and 65%, respectively. The flavonoids also significantly inhibited the transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, CAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) -1c, compared with the control cells. Similarly, there was a significant downregulation of the adipocyte specific markers associated with lipid metabolism, including activating protein-2, fatty acid synthase, hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase, in the flavonoid treated cells. Notably, the cells treated with the flavonoids demonstrated increased expression levels of the insulin-induced genes, insig-1 and insig-2, which may have inhibited the activation of the adipogenic transcription factor, SREBP, eventually leading to the inhibition of adipogenesis. Taken together, these results revealed that the flavonoids from TA possessed an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis through downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors and genes associated with lipid metabolism, and the upregulation of insig 1 and 2, suggesting that the flavonoids from TA may be potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of obesity.

AB Yellow mosaic disease, caused by wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), is one of the most serious diseases of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Japan. The three pathotypes of WYMV are distributed in different geographical areas: pathotype I is found mainly in western and central Japan (Kanto), pathotype II in northern Japan (Tohoku and Hokkaido) and pathotype III on the southern island of Japan (Kyushu). A total of 246 doubled-haploid (DH) lines, derived from a cross between Yumechikara' (resistant) and Kitahonami' (susceptible), were evaluated for 2years for their resistance to WYMV pathotype I. A single major quantitative trait locus, Q.Ymym, mapping to chromosome 2D was associated with resistance to pathotype I in Yumechikara'. This is the first time a QTL responsible for pathotype I resistance has been identified. Fine mapping of Q.Ymym indicated that it was on a tight linkage block originating from Yumechikara', and the markers associated with this block will accelerate the development of varieties resistant to WYMV pathotype I.

AB Anthocyanins contribute to plants' defence against a number of abiotic and biotic stress agents. The anthocyanin pigmentation of the barley leaf sheath is genetically determined by Ant1, a gene which maps to a region of chromosome 7HS delimited by the microsatellite loci Xgbms0226 and Xgbms0240. The sequence of the maize gene C1 (encoding an R2R3 MYB factor regulating anthocyanin synthesis) was used for the PCR-based cloning of Ant1. In ant1 genotypes, no transcript is generated in the leaf sheath, whereas the gene is active in the presence of the dominant allele. A comparison of the coding and promoter sequences of Ant1 (which induces purple pigmentation in the leaf sheath) and ant1 (which does not) showed that the key polymorphisms lay in the promoter sequence. The transcription of four anthocyanin synthesis structural genes (Chi, F3h, Dfr, Ans) was dependent on the allelic status of Ant1.

AB Variegated leaf colour is an important agronomic trait that affects the market value of ornamental kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala). The red leaf phenotype in kale is due to anthocyanin accumulation. To investigate the pattern of inheritance of this trait, we constructed an F-2 population by crossing Y005-15', a double haploid with red leaves, with a white-leaved double haploid, Y011-13-38', followed by self-pollination. An F-2 population consisting of 4284 individuals was used to study the inheritance of this trait, which showed that the character was controlled by a dominate gene. All of the 1050 white leaf trait plants in the F-2 were used for mapping and developing markers linked to Re gene. Results showed that Re was mapped to a locus on linkage group C09 of Brassica oleracea, and the locus was mapped between six SSR markers (C9Z1, C9Z16-1, C9Z90, C9Z94, C9Z96 and C9Z99), with a genetic distance of 6.7, 1.0, 0.3, 2.0, 2.1 and 0.4cM from Re gene, respectively. These results may facilitate marker-assisted selection of the red leaf trait in kale breeding as well as map-based cloning of the red leaf trait gene.

AB This review uses production and climate data to examine global and local production trends that can be related to events such as drought. UK grain quality data is also available and provides an overview of trends in protein content. Literature surveys show a consistent reduction in grain size due to the effects of temperature and/or drought. A review of gene expression studies showed that most genes involved in starch synthesis are down regulated under heat stress. Net protein production is also reduced under heat and/or drought stress but apparently to a lesser degree as the reduction in grain mass is larger, resulting in an increase in protein concentration. Modelling has suggested that adaptation could be achieved by moving production to more extreme latitudes but other research suggests that simply transferring germplasm from one region to another is unlikely to be successful. Another review has identified drought tolerance phenotypes that could be used to breed more drought tolerant crops. At the time of the review, the authors concluded that phenotypic selection was generally preferable to forms of marker-assisted breeding and have used the approach to produce drought tolerant wheat cultivars. Transgenic approaches have also been shown to improve drought tolerance under controlled environment conditions but there are no results to show how well these results translate into improved crop performance under field conditions. The recent advances in genomic data and detecting marker-trait associations suggest that marker-assisted breeding will play a much more important role in breeding drought tolerant cereals in the future.

AB In order to study the synteny between Zoysia japonica and Oryza sativa, we added three types of markers including Restriction fragment length polymorphism, Conserved intron scanning primers and PCR-based landmark unique gene in our previous high-density SSR-based linkage map. A total of 100 loci showed homology to the rice genome were merged into our previously constructed SSR-based linkage map of zoysiagrass. The new map was longer than all zoysiagrass genetic maps reported previously, and contains the number of linkage groups 20, which is equal to the haploid number of chromosomes of zoysiagrass. The new mapped 100 homologous loci were mapped to 19 linkage groups (LGs) except of LG 20, of them, the LGs 2, 8 and 13 of zoysiagrass showed colinearity with chromosomes 3, 6 and 1 of rice respectively, and other LGs of zoysiagrass contained variable numbers of markers that showed homology with the rice genome. These results suggested a syntenic relationship between zoysiagrass and rice. The improved genetic linkage map and the new markers developed in this study will serve as reference genetic linkage maps for zoysiagrass species and will be useful for mapping QTLs associated with various traits, and for improving zoysiagrass breeding programs.

AB Carbon assimilation is the fundamental basis of crop productivity, but this important and complex trait has not been genetically characterized and directly exploited at the commercial level to improve yield. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine natural genetic variation in carbon assimilation, to advance our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms controlling this trait and, on that basis, to develop germplasm with superior photosynthetic capacity. Sorghum is the most productive annual species for biofuel production in which leaf photosynthetic capacity has been associated with biomass yield. In this study, a set of 82 sorghum accessions was genetically characterized and phenotypically evaluated for carbon assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration rate (T), efficiency of energy capture by open PSII reaction centers (Fv'/Fm'), effective quantum yield (I broken vertical bar(PSII)) and photochemical quenching (qP). Phenotypic variation was observed for all traits, with A ranging from 11.6 to 42.5 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The highest positive correlations were between A and I broken vertical bar(PSII) (r = 0.71), g(s) and T (r = 0.89) and I broken vertical bar(PSII) and qP (r = 0.91). The highest negative correlations were between g(s) and A/g(s) (r = -0.82), T and A/g(s) (r = -0.79), T and A/T (r = -0.79) and A/g(s) and A/T (r = -0.78). Population structure and cluster analysis clearly differentiated three subpopulations among this set of accessions with significantly different values for A, g(s) and Fv'/Fm'. This study demonstrates that this diverse set of sorghum accessions could be utilized to identify genes/markers associated with variation in leaf photosynthetic rate and could be exploited in breeding programs to develop germplasm with superior carbon assimilation capacity.

AB Shoot branches or tillers develop from axillary buds. The dormancy versus outgrowth fates of buds depends on genetic, environmental and hormonal signals. Defoliation inhibits bud outgrowth indicating the role of leaf-derived metabolic factors such as sucrose in bud outgrowth. In this study, the sensitivity of bud outgrowth to selective defoliation was investigated. At 6d after planting (6 DAP), the first two leaves of sorghum were fully expanded and the third was partially emerged. Therefore, the leaves were selectively defoliated at 6 DAP and the length of the bud in the first leaf axil was measured at 8 DAP. Bud outgrowth was inhibited by defoliation of only 2cm from the tip of the second leaf blade. The expression of dormancy and sucrose-starvation marker genes was up-regulated and cell cycle and sucrose-inducible genes was down-regulated during the first 24h post-defoliation of the second leaf. At 48h, the expression of these genes was similar to controls as the defoliated plant recovers. Our results demonstrate that small changes in photosynthetic leaf area affect the propensity of tiller buds for outgrowth. Therefore, variation in leaf area and photosynthetic activity should be included when integrating sucrose into models of shoot branching.
   The importance of sucrose as a primary regulator of shoot branching or tillering has been reported recently (Kebrom etal., 2012; Mason etal., 2014). Sucrose levels in tiller buds reflect the relative balance between sucrose supply from photosynthetic leaves, and sucrose utilization for growth, metabolism, and/or storage. Our paper demonstrates that bud outgrowth can be inhibited by a reduction in photosynthetic leaf area providing the basis for integrating sucrose, in addition to hormonal and environmental signals, into models of shoot branch regulation.

AB Pyrenophora teres f. maculata, the causal agent of spot form of net blotch (SFNB), is an emerging pathogen of barley in the United States and Australia. Compared with net form of net blotch (NFNB), less is known in the U.S. Upper Midwest barley breeding programs about host resistance and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with SFNB in breeding lines. The main objective of this study was to identify QTL associated with SFNB resistance in the Upper Midwest two-rowed and six-rowed barley breeding programs using a genome-wide association study approach. A total of 376 breeding lines of barley were evaluated for SFNB resistance at the seedling stage in the greenhouse in Fargo in 2009. The lines were genotyped with 3,072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Phenotypic evaluation showed a wide range of variability among populations from the four breeding programs and the two barley-row types. The two-rowed barley lines were more susceptible to SFNB than the six-rowed lines. Continuous distributions of SFNB severity indicate the quantitative nature of SFNB resistance. The mixed linear model (MLM) analysis, which included both population structure and kinship matrices, was used to identify significant SNP-SFNB associations. Principal component analysis was used to control false marker-trait association. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates varied among chromosomes (10 to 20 cM). The MLM analysis identified 10 potential QTL in barley: SFNB-2H-8-10, SFNB-2H-38.03, SFNB-3H-58.64, SFNB-3H-78.53, SFNB-3H-91.88, SFNB-3H-117.1, SFNB-5H- 155.3, SFNB-6H-5.4, SFNB-6H-33.74, and SFNB-7H-34.82. Among them, four QTL (SFNB-2H-8-10, SFNB-2H-38.03 SFNB-3H-78.53, and SFNB-3H117.1) have not previously been published. Identification of SFNB resistant lines and QTL associated with SFNB resistance in this study will be useful in the development of barley genotypes with better SFNB resistance.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the main fungal diseases of grain crops such as wheat, barley and maize. The FHB species complex produces mycotoxins that cause quality and yield reductions, as well as human and animal health risks. Resistance breeding, integrated with chemical and or cultural control practices has the potential for sustainable control of FHB. However, breeding for FHB resistance has been slow due to limited genetic gains from conventional breeding, requiring complementary genomic tools to explore and manipulate genetic resources. Breeding for FHB resistance in wheat is also hampered by the quantitative nature of the trait, limited understanding of FHB pathogenesis and the large size of the host genome. This paper highlights the state of knowledge on FHB severity, pathogenesis and genetic control strategies. Available genomic technologies used to uncoil the underlying mechanisms of virulence in the dominant FHB species, E graminearum, are further outlined. Interdisciplinary collaboration is required for successful development and deployment of FHB resistant genotypes to wheat growers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding of plant adaptation to abiotic stresses has implications in plant breeding, especially in the context of climate change. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs play a crucial role in gene regulation. Here, wheat plants were exposed to one of the following stresses: continuous light, heat or ultraviolet radiations over five consecutive days and leaf tissues from three biological replicates were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 days after treatment (DAT). A total of 72 small RNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform generating similar to 524 million reads corresponding to similar to 129 million distinct tags from which 232 conserved miRNAs were identified. The expression levels of 1, 2 and 79 miRNAs were affected by ultraviolet radiation, continuous light and heat, respectively. Approximately 55% of the differentially expressed miRNAs were downregulated at 0 and 1 DAT including miR398, miR528 and miR156 that control mRNAs involved in activation of signal transduction pathways and flowering. Other putative targets included histone variants and methyltransferases. These results suggest a temporal miRNA-guided post-transcriptional regulation that enables wheat to respond to abiotic stresses, particularly heat. Designing novel wheat breeding strategies such as regulatory gene-based marker assisted selection depends on accurate identification of stress induced miRNAs.

AB Thousand-grain weight (TGW) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) contributes significantly to grain yield. In the present study, a candidate gene associated with TGW was identified through specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) of DNA bulks of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from the cross between Jing 411 and Hongmangchun 21. The gene was located on chromosome 7A, designated as TaTGW-7A with a complete genome sequence and an open reading frame (ORF). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was present in the first exon between two alleles at TaTGW-7A locus, resulting in a Val to Ala substitution, corresponding to a change from higher to lower TGW. Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) (TGW7A) and InDel (TG9) markers were developed to discriminate the two alleles TaTOW-7Aa and TaTGW-7Ab for higher and lower TGW, respectively. A major QTL co-segregating with TaTGW-7A explained 21.7-27.1% of phenotypic variance for TGW in the RIL population across five environments. The association of TaTGW-7A with TGW was further validated in a natural population and Chinese mini core collections. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed higher transcript levels of TaTGW-7Aa than those of TaTGW-7Ab during grain development. High frequencies of the superior allele TaTGW-7Aa for higher TGW in Chinese mini-core collections (65.0%) and 501 wheat varieties (86.0%) indicated a strong and positive selection of this allele in wheat breeding. The molecular markers TGW7A and TG9 can be used for improvement of TGW in breeding programs.

AB Background: Wild relatives of wheat play a significant role in wheat improvement as a source of genetic diversity. Stem rust disease of wheat causes significant yield losses at the global level and stem rust pathogen race TTKSK (Ug99) is virulent to most previously deployed resistance genes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify loci conferring resistance to stem rust pathogen races including Ug99 in an Aegilops umbelluata bi-parental mapping population using genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) SNP markers.
   Results: A bi-parental F-2:3 population derived from a cross made between stem rust resistant accession PI 298905 and stem rust susceptible accession PI 542369 was used for this study. F2 individuals were evaluated with stem rust race TTTTF followed by testing F-2:3 families with races TTTTF and TTKSK. The segregation pattern of resistance to both stem rust races suggested the presence of one resistance gene. A genetic linkage map, comprised 1,933 SNP markers, was created for all seven chromosomes of Ae. umbellulata using GBS. A major stem rust resistance QTL that explained 80% and 52% of the phenotypic variations for TTTTF and TTKSK, respectively, was detected on chromosome 2U of Ae. umbellulata.
   Conclusion: The novel resistance gene for stem rust identified in this study can be transferred to commercial wheat varieties assisted by the tightly linked markers identified here. These markers identified through our mapping approach can be a useful strategy to identify and track the resistance gene in marker-assisted breeding in wheat.

AB Phenolic compounds (PCs) affect the bread quality and can also affect the other types of end-use food products such as chapatti (unleavened flat bread), now globally recognized wheat-based food product. The detailed analysis of PCs and their biosynthesis genes in diverse bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties differing for chapatti quality have not been studied. In this study, the identification and quantification of PCs using UPLC-QTOF-MS and/or MS/MS and functional genomics techniques such as microarrays and qRT-PCR of their biosynthesis genes have been studied in a good chapatti variety, "C 306" and a poor chapatti variety, "Sonalika." About 80% (69/87) of plant phenolic compounds were tentatively identified in these varieties. Nine PCs (hinokinin, coutaric acid, fertaric acid, p-coumaroylqunic acid, kaempferide, isorhamnetin, epigallocatechin gallate, methyl isoorientin-2'-O-rhamnoside, and cyanidin-3-rutinoside) were identified only in the good chapatti variety and four PCs (tricin, apigenindin, quercetin-3-0-glucuronide, and myricetin-3-glucoside) in the poor chapatti variety. Therefore, about 20% of the identified PCs are unique to each other and may be "variety or genotype" specific PCs. Fourteen PCs used for quantification showed high variation between the varieties. The microarray data of 44 phenolic compound biosynthesis genes and 17 of them on qRT-PCR showed variation in expression level during seed development and majority of them showed low expression in the good chapatti variety. The expression pattern in the good chapatti variety was largely in agreement with that of phenolic compounds. The level of variation of 12 genes was high between the good and poor chapatti quality varieties and has potential in development of markers. The information generated in this study can be extended onto a larger germplasm set for development of molecular markers using QTL and/or association mapping approaches for their application in wheat breeding.

AB The flight of the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), near grain storages and at distances from them, was investigated to assess the potential of these beetles to infest grain and spread insecticide resistance genes. We caught R. dominica in pheromone-baited flight traps (and blank controls) set at storages, in fields away from storages, and in native vegetation across a 12-mo period. A functional set of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed, enabling population genetic analyses on the trapped beetles. Pheromone-baited traps caught just as many R. dominica adults at least 1 km from grain storages as were caught adjacent to grain storages. Samples of beetles caught were genetically homogeneous across the study area (over 7,000 km(2)) in South Queensland, Australia. However, a change in genetic structure was detected at one bulk storage site. Subsequent analysis detected a heterozygous excess, which indicated a population bottleneck. Only a few beetles were caught during the winter months of June and July. To assess the mating status and potential fecundity of dispersing R. dominica females, we captured beetles as they left grain storages and quantified offspring production and life span in the laboratory. Nearly all (95%) of these dispersing females had mated and these produced an average of 242 offspring. We demonstrated that R. dominica populations in the study area display a high degree of connectivity and this is a result of the active dispersal of mated individuals of high potential fecundity.

AB DNA methylation is a major epigenetic marker in plants that plays a crucial role in transcriptional and developmental regulation. The DNA methylation 'code' is thought to be 'read' by a set of proteins containing methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD). However, little is known about MBD genes in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of TaMBD6 and its homeologues (TaMBD6_A, TaMBD6_B, and TaMBD6_D) in hexaploid wheat. The cDNA was quite different among the three homeologues and InDel mutations were detected in 5'-UTR and coding region. Two types of TRs (tandem repeats) - TR1 (57 bp) and TR2 (39 bp)- occurred in the coding region. TaMBD6_B harbored five copies of TR1 and two copies of TR2. In contrast, TaMBD6_A lacked 30 bp between the 2nd and 3rd copy of TR1, while TaMBD6_D was missing two copies of TR1 but had three copies of TR2. TaMBD6_A, TaMBD6_B, and TaMBD6_D encoded 435, 446, and 420 amino acids, respectively. Structural analysis of TaMBD6 protein indicated that each of the three homeologues had an identical MBD domain at the N-terminal, as well as a typical nuclear localization signal. Although genomics analysis showed that two introns were included, the length of the first intron varied from 3100 bp to 3471 bp and their sequences were very different. Expression analysis demonstrated that the transcription level of TaMBD6 began to increase gradually in developing grains at 15 days after pollination while decreasing significantly in endosperm and embryo tissues during germination. Expression of TaMBD6 appeared to be positively correlated with starch metabolism in the endosperm but was negatively correlated with embryo formation and sprouting. We were also interested to learn that TaMBD6 homeologues were differentially expressed in developing wheat plants and that their expression patterns were variously affected by vernalization treatment. Further investigation revealed that TaMBD6 was induced by prolonged chilling, indicating that the protein is potentially involved in regulating the developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive stages. Although the homeologues generally showed similar differential expression patterns, TaMBD6_D and TaMBD6_B contribute more to the processes of grain development and germination while TaMBD6_A is predominant in mature plants.

AB A novel QTL, Q.DB.ui-7DS, and the PCR-based markers identified in the current study will accelerate variety development for resistance to dwarf and common bunt of wheat.
   Dwarf bunt [Tilletia controversa J.G. Kuhn [as 'contraversa'], in Rabenhorst, Hedwigia 13: 188 (1874)] is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that reduces grain yield and quality. A number of distinct genes conferring resistance to dwarf bunt have been used by breeding programs for nearly 100 years. However, few markers were identified that can be used in selection of dwarf bunt resistance. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the bunt-resistant germplasm, Idaho 444 (IDO444), and the susceptible cultivar, Rio Blanco, was evaluated for phenotypic reaction to dwarf bunt inoculation in four trials in two locations (USU and USDA) over 3 years. The population was genotyped with the Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and the Illumina Infinium 9K iSelect marker platforms. A total of three QTL were detected, and resistant alleles were from IDO444. QTL Q.DB.ui-7DS on 7DS was determined based on the location of a DArT marker wPt-2565 (X116197), which was consistently detected and explained 32 to 56 % of phenotypic variation among the four trials. QTL Q.DB.ui-1A on 1A was detected in three Utah State University (USU) trials and explained 11-15 % of phenotypic variation. QTL Q.DB.ui-2B on 2B was detected in two USU and one United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) trials and explained up to 6 % of phenotypic variation. Two PCR-based markers were developed based on the sequence of wPt-2565 and validated in the RIL population and used in genotyping of dwarf bunt differential lines, known resistance sources, and resistant cultivars.

AB This study revealed a complex genetic architecture of male floral traits in wheat, and Rht-D1 was identified as the only major QTL. Genome-wide prediction approaches but also phenotypic recurrent selection appear promising to increase outcrossing ability required for hybrid wheat seed production.
   Hybrid wheat breeding is a promising approach to increase grain yield and yield stability. However, the identification of lines with favorable male floral characteristics required for hybrid seed production currently poses a severe bottleneck for hybrid wheat breeding. This study therefore aimed to unravel the genetic architecture of floral traits and to assess the potential of genomic approaches to accelerate their improvement. To this end, we employed a panel of 209 diverse winter wheat lines assessed for male floral traits and genotyped with genome-wide markers as well as for Rht-B1 and Rht-D1. We found the highest proportion of explained genotypic variance for the Rht-D1 locus (11-24 %), for which the dwarfing allele Rht-D1b had a negative effect on anther extrusion, visual anther extrusion and pollen mass. The genome-wide scan detected only few QTL with small or medium effects, indicating a complex genetic architecture. Consequently, marker-assisted selection yielded only moderate prediction abilities (0.44-0.63), mainly relying on Rht-D1. Genomic selection based on weighted ridge-regression best linear unbiased prediction achieved higher prediction abilities of up to 0.70 for anther extrusion. In conclusion, recurrent phenotypic selection appears most cost-effective for the initial improvement of floral traits in wheat, while genome-wide prediction approaches may be worthwhile when complete marker profiles are already available in a hybrid wheat breeding program.

AB Here we report the production of a set of wheat - Aegilops speltoides Robertsonian translocations covering all Ae. speltoides chromosome arms except the long arm of the homoeologous group 4 chromosome.
   Aegilops speltoides of the Poaceae family is the most probable donor of the B and G genomes of polyploid Triticum species and also an important source of resistance to diseases and pests of wheat. Previously, we reported the production of a complete set of T aestivum-Ae. speltoides chromosome addition lines and a set of disomic S(B/A)-genome chromosome substitution lines. The isolation of compensating Robertsonian translocations (RobTs) composed of alien chromosome arms translocated to homoeologous wheat chromosome arms is the important next step to exploit the genetic variation of a wild relative of wheat. Here, we report the development of molecular markers specific for the S-genome chromosomes and their use in the isolation of a set of 13 compensating wheat-Ae. speltoides RobTs covering the S genome of Ae. speltoides except for the long arm of chromosome 4S. Most of the RobTs were fully fertile and will facilitate mapping of genes to specific chromosome arms and also will accelerate the introgression of agronomically useful traits from Ae. speltoides into wheat by homologous recombination.

AB SrTA10187 was fine-mapped to a 1.1 cM interval, candidate genes were identified in the region of interest, and molecular markers were developed for marker-assisted selection and Sr gene pyramiding.
   Stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Pgt) races belonging to the Ug99 (TTKSK) race group pose a serious threat to global wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. To improve Pgt host resistance, the Ug99-effective resistance gene SrTA10187 previously identified in Aegilops tauschii Coss. was introgressed into wheat, and mapped to the short arm of wheat chromosome 6D. In this study, high-resolution mapping of SrTA10187 was done using a population of 1,060 plants. Pgt resistance was screened using race QFCSC. PCR-based SNP and STS markers were developed from genotyping-by-sequencing tags and SNP sequences available in online databases. SrTA10187 segregated as expected in a 3:1 ratio of resistant to susceptible individuals in three out of six BC3F2 families, and was fine-mapped to a 1.1 cM region on wheat chromosome 6DS. Marker context sequence was aligned to the reference Ae. tauschii genome to identify the physical region encompassing SrTA10187. Due to the size of the corresponding region, candidate disease resistance genes could not be identified with confidence. Comparisons with the Ae. tauschii genetic map developed by Luo et al. (PNAS 110(19):7940-7945, 2013) enabled identification of a discrete genetic locus and a BAC minimum tiling path of the region spanning SrTA10187. Annotation of pooled BAC library sequences led to the identification of candidate genes in the region of interest-including a single NB-ARC-LRR gene. The shorter genetic interval and flanking KASP (TM) and STS markers developed in this study will facilitate marker-assisted selection, gene pyramiding, and positional cloning of SrTA10187.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is a worldwide destructive disease affecting cereals such as wheat. FHB resistance is a quantitative trait, and information for FHB resistance QTLs in wheat is available. However, little is known about genes underlying the FHB resistance QTL regions. Using a computational approach in this study, we have mined eight FHB resistance QTLs in wheat and predicted the candidate genes falling within these QTL intervals based on the available sequences and markers. A total of 18 genomic scaffolds located at chromosomes 2AL, 2DL, 3B and 4BS were prioritized to harbor FHB-resistant candidate genes. These genes are mainly involved in plant defense response, immune regulation and cellular detoxification. We believe that our results constitute a starting point for further validation to improve FHB-resistant bread wheat varieties.

AB Sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers that are highly desirable in crop breeding for marker-assisted selection (MAS) are routinely analysed by gel-based methods that are low-throughput, time-consuming and laborious. In this study, we showed a rapid and convenient method for analysis of SCAR markers in a gel-free manner. Seven SCAR markers, linked to rust resistance genes (Sr24, Sr26 and Sr31) and seed quality traits (Pina, Pinb and Glu-D1) in wheat (Triticum aestivum), were amplified on a real-time PCR machine using custom reaction mixture. Subsequently, melting curve analysis was performed, to assess the specificity of amplicons. Using the amplicon-specific melt-profiles, the presence/absence of SCAR markers was analysed in fifteen genotypes and five F-2 populations. Unlike the fluorescence-based in-tube detection methods, the present method used the amplicon-specific melt-profiles to evaluate the status of the SCAR markers, thus eliminating the need for gel-based analysis. Results also showed feasibility of multiplex analysis of two markers with well-separated melting profiles. Overall, the approach is a rapid, convenient and cost-effective method for high-throughput screening of SCAR markers.

AB We developed a new disomic addition line M11028-1-1-5 (2n=44=21+1) from a cross between wheat cv. 7182' and octoploid Tritileymus M47 (2n=8x=56, AABBDDNsNs). Cytological observations demonstrated that M11028-1-1-5 contained 44 chromosomes and formed 22 bivalents during meiotic metaphase I. The genomic insitu hybridization (GISH) investigations showed this line contained 42 wheat chromosomes and a pair of L.mollis chromosomes. SSR, EST and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) markers were screened to determine the homoeologous relationships of the introduced L.mollis chromosomes in wheat background.

Gliadin analysis also confirmed that the added chromosomes in M11028-1-1-5 were correlated with the sixth group chromosome. This indicated that M11028-1-1-5 contained a pair of introduced L.mollis chromosome belonging to homoeologous group 6, which we designated it as Lm#6Ns disomic addition line. This is the first report of a common wheat-L.mollis disomic addition line.

AB Sitodiplosis mosellana Gehin, one of the most important pests of wheat, undergoes obligatory diapause as a larva to survive unfavorable temperature extremes during hot summers and cold winters. To explore the potential roles of heat shock proteins (hsp) in this process, we cloned full-length cDNAs of hsp70, hsc70 and hsp90 from S. mosellana larvae, and examined their expression in response to diapause and short-term temperature stresses. Three hsps included all signature sequences of corresponding protein family and EEVD motifs. They showed high homology to their counterparts in other species, and the phylogenetic analysis of hsp90 was consistent with the known classification of insects. Expression of hsp70 and hsp90 were highly induced by diapause, particularly pronounced during summer and winter. Interestingly, hsp70 was more strongly expressed in summer than in winter whereas hsp90 displayed the opposite pattern. Abundance of hsc70 mRNA was comparable prior to and during diapauses and was highly up-regulated when insects began to enter the stage of post-diapause quiescence. Heat-stressed over-summering larvae (>= 30 degrees C) or cold-stressed over-wintering larvae (<=degrees C) could further elevate expression of these three genes, but temperature extremes i.e. as high as 45 degrees C or as low as -15 degrees C failed to trigger such expression patterns. Notably, hsp70 was most sensitive to heat stress and hsp90 was most sensitive to cold stress. These results suggested that hsp70 and hsp90 play key roles in diapause maintenance and thermal stress; the former may be more prominent contributor to heat tolerance and the latter for cold tolerance. In contrast, hsc70 most likely is involved in developmental transition from diapause to post-diapause quiescence, and thus may serve as a molecular marker to predict diapause termination.

AB Stripe rust (yellow rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp.tritici (Pst), is a serious disease of wheat worldwide, including China. Growing resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to control the disease. To assess the stripe rust resistance in commercial wheat cultivars and advanced lines in the Yellow and Huai River Valley Wheat Region, 115 wheat cultivars (lines) collected from 13 provinces in this region were evaluated with the most prevalent Chinese Pst races CYR32, CYR33 and the new race V26 at seedling stage. In addition, these wheat entries were inoculated with the mixed races of CYR32 and CYR33 at the adult-plant stage in the field. The results indicated that 53 (46.1%) cultivars (lines) had all-stage resistance to all the three races, and 16 (13.9%) cultivars (lines) showed adult-plant resistance. The possible stripe rust resistance genes in these entries were postulated by the closely linked markers of all-stage resistance genes Yr5, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15 and Yr26 and adult-plant resistance gene Yr18. Molecular analysis indicated that resistance genes Yr5, Yr9, Yr10, Yr18 and Yr26 were found in 5 (4.3%), 38 (33.0%), 1 (0.9%), 2 (1.7%) and 8 (7.0%) entries, respectively. No entry was found to carry the Yr15 gene. In future breeding programs, Yr5, Yr15 and Yr18 should be used to pyramid with other effective genes to develop wheat cultivars with high-level and durable resistance to stripe rust, whereas Yr9, Yr10 and Yr26 should not be used or used in a limited way due to the virulent races present in China.

AB Increased modern farming of superior types of the oil palm, Elaeis guineensis Jacq., which has naturally efficient oil biosynthesis, has made it the world's foremost edible oil crop. Breeding improvement is, however, circumscribed by time and costs associated with the tree's long reproductive cycle, large size and 10-15 years of field testing. Marker-assisted breeding has considerable potential for improving this crop. Towards this, quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to oil yield component traits were mapped in a high-yield population. In total, 164 QTLs associated with 21 oil yield component traits were discovered, with cumulative QTL effects increasing in tandem with the number of QTL markers and matching the QT+ alleles for each trait. The QTLs confirmed all traits to be polygenic, with many genes of individual small effects on independent loci, but epistatic interactions are not ruled out. Furthermore, several QTLs maybe pleiotropic as suggested by QTL clustering of inter-related traits on almost all linkage groups. Certain regions of the chromosomes seem richer in the genes affecting a particular yield component trait and likely encompass pleiotropic, epistatic and heterotic effects. A large proportion of the identified additive effects from QTLs may actually arise from genic interactions between loci. Comparisons with previous mapping studies show that most of the QTLs were for similar traits and shared similar marker intervals on the same linkage groups. Practical applications for such QTLs in marker-assisted breeding will require seeking them out in different genetic backgrounds and environments.

AB In 2013-2015 virulence in the wheat leaf rust population was evaluated on 17 Thatcher near-isogenic lines with leaf rust resistance genes. A total of 110 wheat leaf rust isolates were analyzed. Resistance genes Lr9 and Lr19 were effective to all tested isolates. Genes Lr24 and Lr28 conditioned resistance to 92% of the tested rust isolates. Thirty-seven winter wheat cultivars registered in Slovakia were analyzed for the presence of Lr10, Lr24, Lr26, Lr34 and Lr37 using tightly linked molecular markers. Gene Lr37 was the most common in the tested cultivars. Leaf rust resistance was also tested in 13 wheat cultivars at the seedling stage with representative pathotypes of leaf rust.

AB The quantitative trait loci QYr.sun-3BS and QYr.sun-4DL were identified in the W195/BTSS recombinant inbred line (RIL) population in a previous study. QYr.sun-3BS explained 34 to 59% phenotypic variation in stripe rust response. We evaluated parental genotypes at different growth stages and temperature regimes to detect the critical stage for expression of QYr.sun3BS. W195 expressed low infection type (IT); 1C at the fourth leaf stage, when incubated at 21 +/- 2 degrees C and the alternate parent BTSS was susceptible (IT 3(+)). Monogenic segregation for stripe rust response was observed among the RIL population at the fourth leaf stage and the underlying locus was temporarily named YrW195. YrW195 corresponded to QYr.sun-3BS. Since no previously designated stripe rust resistance genes that expresses at and after the fourth leaf stage was mapped in this region, YrW195 was formally named Yr58. Genotyping with Yr46-linked markers indicated the presence of Yr46 in W195, which corresponded to QYr.sun-4DL. The RILs carrying Yr58 and Yr46 singly produced IT 23C and IT 3(+), respectively, and those carrying both genes produced IT; 1C indicating the enhancement of Yr58 expression by Yr46. The absence of Yr58-linked alleles of markers sun533 and sun476 in 74 of the 76 wheat cultivars demonstrated their usefulness for marker-assisted selection.

AB Leymus mollis (Trin.) Pilger (NsNsXmXm, 2n = 28), a wild relative of common wheat, possesses many potentially valuable traits for wheat breeding, i.e., strong and short stems, long spikes with numerous spikelets, tolerance to drought and cold, and resistance to many fungal and bacterial diseases. In this study, we hybridized a wheat-L. mollis triple substitution line 05DM6 x Triticum aestivum L. cv. 7182 to obtain DM45, a single chromosome substitution line. Cytological studies demonstrated that DM45 had a chromosome karyotype of 2n = 42 = 21II. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis indicated that DM45 had a pair of Ns chromosomes from L. mollis. Analysis with DNA markers, i.e., two simple sequence repeats (Xgdm111 and Xgdm126) and two expressed sequence tag-sequence tagged sites (CD453004 and BE443796), showed that the wheat 1Ds chromosome were substituted with a pair of 1Ns chromosomes from L. mollis in DM45. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that DM45 possessed Ns genome-specific bands in the low and high molecular weight glutenin subunit regions, whereas it lacked one glutenin subunit translated from genes on chromosome 1D, thereby confirming that DM45 was a wheat-L. mollis 1Ns#1 (1D) disomic substitution line. Agronomic trait evaluations showed that DM45 was much improved in terms of the 1000-grain weight and the protein and glutenin contents of its seeds, as well as having more florets and spikelets compared with its relative, common wheat variety 7182. The substitution line DM45 could be used as a novel germplasm in wheat genetic and breeding programs.

AB Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in China. Rapid change to virulence following release of resistant cultivars necessitates ongoing discovery and exploitation of new resistance resources. Considerable effort has been directed at non-host resistance (NHR) which is believed to be durable. In the present study we identified rice mutant crr1 (compromised resistance to rust 1) that exhibited compromised NHR to Pst. Compared with wild type rice variety Nipponbare, crr1 mutant displayed a threefold increase in penetration rate by Pst, and enhanced hyphal growth. The pathogen also developed haustoria in crr1 mesophyll cells, but failed to sporulate. The response to the adapted rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae was unchanged in crr1 relative to the wild type. Several defense-related genes involved in the SA- and JA-mediated defense pathways response and in phytoalexin synthesis (such as OsPR1a, OsLOX1, and OsCPS4) were more rapidly and strongly induced in infected crr1 leaves than in the wild type, suggesting that other layers of defense are still in effect. Genetic analysis and mapping located the mutant loci at a region between markers ID14 and RM25792, which cover about 290 kb genome sequence on chromosome 10. Further fine mapping and cloning of the locus should provide further insights into NHR to rust fungi in rice, and may reveal new strategies for improving rust resistance in wheat.

AB Environmental stresses frequently affect plant growth and development, and many genes have been found to be induced by unfavorable environmental conditions. Here, we reported the biological functions of TaNAC2D, a stress-related NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) gene from wheat. TaNAC2D showed transcriptional activator activity in yeast. TaNAC2D-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of wheat mesophyll protoplasts. TaNAC2D transcript abundance was significantly induced by NaCl, PEG6000, and abscisic acid (ABA) at seedling stage, and repressed by NaCl and PEG6000 at mature plant stage. When TaNAC2D was introduced into Arabidopsis, the 35-day-old soil grown TaNAC2D-overexpression (TaNAC2D-OX) plants displayed slower stomatal closure, higher water loss rate, and more sensitivity to salt and drought stresses compared with WT plants. In contrast, TaNAC2D-OX seedlings, grown on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl, Mannitol, and MV, had enhanced tolerances to salt, osmotic and oxidative stresses during seed germination and post-germination periods. The opposite stress-responsive phenotypes of transgenic Arabidopsis were consistent with the expression patterns of TaNAC2D in wheat. Moreover, under high salinity and dehydration conditions, three marker genes, including NCED3, RD29A, and RD2913, were down regulated in 35-day-old TaNAC2D OX plants grown in soil and up-regulated in 14-day-old TaNAC2D-OX seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium. Our results suggest that the change in growth stages and environmental conditions may regulate TaNAC2D's function.

AB Background: Sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., is an important food crop widely grown in the world. However, little is known about the genome of this species because it is a highly heterozygous hexaploid. Gaining a more in-depth knowledge of sweetpotato genome is therefore necessary and imperative. In this study, the first bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of sweetpotato was constructed. Clones from the BAC library were end-sequenced and analyzed to provide genome-wide information about this species.
   Results: The BAC library contained 240,384 clones with an average insert size of 101 kb and had a 7.93-10.82 x coverage of the genome, and the probability of isolating any single-copy DNA sequence from the library was more than 99%. Both ends of 8310 BAC clones randomly selected from the library were sequenced to generate 11,542 high-quality BAC-end sequences (BESs), with an accumulative length of 7,595,261 bp and an average length of 658 bp. Analysis of the BESs revealed that 12.17% of the sweetpotato genome were known repetitive DNA, including 7.37% long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, 1.15% Non-LTR retrotransposons and 1.42% Class II DNA transposons etc., 18.31% of the genome were identified as sweetpotato-unique repetitive DNA and 10.00% of the genome were predicted to be coding regions. In total, 3,846 simple sequences repeats (SSRs) were identified, with a density of one SSR per 1.93 kb, from which 288 SSRs primers were designed and tested for length polymorphism using 20 sweetpotato accessions, 173 (60.07%) of them produced polymorphic bands. Sweetpotato BESs had significant hits to the genome sequences of I. trifida and more matches to the whole-genome sequences of Solanum lycopersicum than those of Vitis vinifera, Theobroma cacao and Arabidopsis thaliana.
   Conclusions: The first BAC library for sweetpotato has been successfully constructed. The high quality BESs provide first insights into sweetpotato genome composition, and have significant hits to the genome sequences of I. trifida and more matches to the whole-genome sequences of Solanum lycopersicum. These resources as a robust platform will be used in high-resolution mapping, gene cloning, assembly of genome sequences, comparative genomics and evolution for sweetpotato.

AB A panel of 89 local commercial cultivars of bread wheat was tested in field trials in the dry conditions of Northern Kazakhstan. Two distinct groups of cultivars (six cultivars in each group), which had the highest and the lowest grain yield under drought were selected for further experiments. A dehydration test conducted on detached leaves indicated a strong association between rates of water loss in plants from the first group with highest grain yield production in the dry environment relative to the second group. Modern high-throughput Amplifluor Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) technology was applied to study allelic variations in a series of drought-responsive genes using 19 SNP markers. Genotyping of an SNP in the TaDREB5 (DREB2-type) gene using the Amplifluor SNP marker KATU48 revealed clear allele distribution across the entire panel of wheat accessions, and distinguished between the two groups of cultivars with high and low yield under drought. Significant differences in expression levels of TaDREB5 were revealed by qRT-PCR. Most wheat plants from the first group of cultivars with high grain yield showed slight up-regulation in the TaDREB5 transcript in dehydrated leaves. In contrast, expression of TaDREB5 in plants from the second group of cultivars with low grain yield was significantly down-regulated. It was found that SNPs did not alter the amino acid sequence of TaDREB5 protein. Thus, a possible explanation is that alternative splicing and up-stream regulation of TaDREB5 may be affected by SNP, but these hypotheses require additional analysis (and will be the focus of future studies).

AB Trichothecene genotype composition, mycotoxin production, genetic diversity, and population structure were analyzed, using 185 Fusarium strains collected from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) throughout the Jiangsu province during 1976, 1983, 1998, 2006, and 2014. The results showed that 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3ADON) was consistently the predominant type in this region over 40 years, and the nivalenol (NIV) type has emerged since 1998. Long-term rotation of wheat and rice (Oryza sativa L.), rather than fungicide application, crop fitness, or weather conditions, might be the main cause of this phenomenon. The genetic diversity results from two toxin synthetic genes, Pks4 and Tri10, and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers revealed the largest variance within the population in 1998, which was also the year with the highest production of mycotoxins. Population differentiation analysis indicated that major temporal population comparisons from the same area were not significantly differentiated. Our results showed that dominant species could maintain genetic stability for a long time, and Pks4 would be of utility in genetic and population studies.

AB The rapid strides in molecular marker technologies followed by genomics, and next generation sequencing advancements in three major crops (rice, maize and wheat) of the world have given opportunities for their use in the orphan, but highly valuable future crops, including finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.]. Finger millet has many special agronomic and nutritional characteristics, which make it an indispensable crop in arid, semi-arid, hilly and tribal areas of India and Africa. The crop has proven its adaptability in harsh conditions and has shown resilience to climate change. The adaptability traits of finger millet have shown the advantage over major cereal grains under stress conditions, revealing it as a storehouse of important genomic resources for crop improvement. Although new technologies for genomic studies are now available, progress in identifying and tapping these important alleles or genes is lacking. RAPDs were the default choice for genetic diversity studies in the crop until the last decade, but the subsequent development of SSRs and comparative genomics paved the way for the marker assisted selection in finger millet. Resistance gene homologs from NBS-LRR region of finger millet for blast and sequence variants for nutritional traits from other cereals have been developed and used invariably. Population structure analysis studies exhibit 24 sub-populations in the finger millet gene pool with separate grouping of Indian and exotic genotypes. Recently, the omics technologies have been efficiently applied to understand the nutritional variation, drought tolerance and gene mining. Progress has also occurred with respect to transgenics development. This review presents the current biotechnological advancements along with research gaps and future perspective of genomic research in finger millet.

AB Wheat yield can be enhanced by modifying the spike morphology and the plant height. In this study, a population of 191 F-9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between two winter cultivars Yumai 8679 and Jing 411. A dense genetic linkage map with 10,816 markers was constructed by incorporating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker information. Five spike morphological traits and plant height were evaluated under nine environments for the RILs and parental lines, and the number of detected environmentally stable QTLs were 18 and three, respectively. The 1 RS/1BL (rye) translocation increased both spike length and spikelet number with constant spikelet compactness. The QPht.cau-2D.1 was identical to gene Rht8, which decreased spike length without modifying spikelet number. Notably, four novel QTLs locating on chromosomes 1AS (QSc.cau-1A.1), 2DS (QSc.cau-2D.1), and 7BS (QSI.cau-7B.1 and QSI.cau-7B.2) were firstly identified in this study, which provide further insights into the genetic factors that shaped the spike morphology in wheat. Moreover, SNP markers tightly linked to previously reported QTLs will eventually facilitate future studies including their positional cloning or marker-assisted selection.

AB Goat grasses (Aegilops spp.) contributed to the evolution of bread wheat and are important sources of genes and alleles for modern wheat improvement. However, their use in alien introgression breeding is hindered by poor knowledge of their genome structure and a lack of molecular tools. The analysis of large and complex genomes may be simplified by dissecting them into single chromosomes via flow cytometric sorting. In some species this is not possible due to similarities in relative DNA content among chromosomes within a karyotype. This work describes the distribution of GAA and ACG microsatellite repeats on chromosomes of the U, M, S and C genomes of Aegilops, and the use of microsatellite probes to label the chromosomes in suspension by fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISHIS). Bivariate flow cytometric analysis of chromosome DAPI fluorescence and fluorescence of FITC-labelled microsatellites made it possible to discriminate all chromosomes and sort them with negligible contamination by other chromosomes. DNA of purified chromosomes was used as a template for polymerase chain reation (PCR) using Conserved Orthologous Set (COS) markers with known positions on wheat A, B and D genomes. Wheat-Aegilops macrosyntenic comparisons using COS markers revealed significant rearrangements in the U and C genomes, while the M and S genomes exhibited structure similar to wheat. Purified chromosome fractions provided an attractive resource to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops genomes, and the COS markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes will facilitate alien gene introgression into wheat.

AB Identification of earliness per se (Eps) flowering time loci in spring wheat are troublesome due to confounding effects of vernalization and photoperiod responses. The Wheat Association Mapping Initiative panel of 287 elite lines was assessed to identify genomic regions associated with Eps and to understand the effects of vernalization and photoperiod treatments in spring wheat. The panel was grown under field conditions with four different treatments: (i) vernalization, where 1-d germinated seeds were kept at 4 degrees C for 6 to 8 wk; (ii) extended photoperiod treatment, from seedling emergence to 10 d after anthesis in the field; (iii) treatments (i) and (ii) in combination; and (iv) a control treatment without either (i) or (ii). The combined vernalization and photoperiod treatments had the greatest effect in advancing the flowering time (4 d). Genome-wide association study in this panel on treatment (iii) detected a locus for Eps in chromosome 1D at 163 to 167 cM. An analysis of the flowering time data on this panel from 19 international environments did not show the presence of Eps in chromosome 1D, indicating the possible masking effect of vernalization and photoperiod genes. This study also validated the diagnostic marker-a transcription factor in the circadian clock input pathway called Triticum aestivum EARLY FLOWERING 3-that is associated with Eps in chromosome 1D and can be used for marker-assisted selection.

TI Identification and Validation of SNP Markers Linked to the Stripe Rust

   L.; BREAD WHEAT; SELECTION; UG99
AB Stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici) is a devastating disease for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. Yr5 is a race-specific resistance gene, effective to all races that have been identified in the United States. Therefore, it has been increasingly used for US cultivar development. The goal of this study was to identify and validate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers tightly linked with Yr5, evaluate their usefulness with a diverse set of wheat materials, and dissect the Yr5 region to search for candidate genes using a comparative genomic approach. Competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) markers based on Illumina iSelect 9000 SNP loci IWA6121 and IWA4096 were identified as flanking markers for Yr5 in two spring wheat recombinant inbred line populations that were developed from crosses between moderately susceptible line 'WA8149' and Yr5 donors ` S0900317' and ` S0900163.' These markers were closer to the gene than previously reported markers. Haplotype analysis based on loci of these KASP markers in a set of the Pacific Northwest spring and winter wheat lines and a worldwide spring wheat core collection showed that the combined haplotype for these markers is nearly diagnostic for the presence of Yr5. The Yr5-syntenic regions in Brachypodium and rice (Oryza sativa L.) contained a putative gene encoding a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat disease resistance protein. Wheat gene Traes_2BL_B5FC3BC9E showed high similarity with these Brachypodium and rice genes, and a marker designed from this gene was mapped closest to Yr5 in the recombinant inbred line populations. This study provides useful SNP markers for Yr5 in wheat breeding programs and resources for potential map-based cloning of Yr5.

AB The spring wheat belt of Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan covers more than 15 million ha. While moisture stress is the main factor limiting production, rusts also represent a major challenge, especially in years with higher rainfall. Stem rust was not considered economically important until 2015 when a local epidemic occurred in the Omsk region of Russia and neighboring areas of Kazakhstan and affected more than 1 million ha. It occurred again in 2016 though the spread, severity and losses were less. This study used 16 pathotypes and 17 molecular markers to characterize a set of 146 spring wheat varieties and breeding lines identified as stem rust resistant in Kenya and the Kazakhstan-Siberia region for the presence of major genes. The genetic basis of resistance in the material was limited to Sr25, Sr31, Sr36, Sr6Ai, Sr6Ai#2, and some unknown major genes. Genes Sr25 and Sr6Ai#2 also provided high levels of resistance to leaf rust through linkages with Lr19 and Lr6Ai#2. Adult plant resistance to stem rust was observed in 26 genotypes (16.5 %), including eight possessing Sr57 gene. The high risk of stem rust-as indicated by the 2015 Siberian epidemic-means that there is an urgent need to diversify the genetic bases of resistance and to promote resistant varieties with farmers.

AB Understanding the genetics of drought tolerance is a major goal of plant breeders, especially in the Mediterranean region due to its sensitivity to drought and climate changes. Here we investigated genomic regions associated with heading date and yield under rainfed (R) and irrigated (I) conditions, along with some drought tolerance indices derived from phenotypic data collected on a panel of 83 European barley cultivars evaluated in field trials in Foggia, southern Italy, for three growing seasons. A genome wide association analysis (GWAS) was carried out using gene-based SNPs incorporated in the Illumina iSELECT Chip with known map position. A total of 4169 polymorphic SNPs were considered after filtering out SNPs with >10 % missing data and <10 % minimum allele frequency. Heritability was high for heading date and moderate for yield. Principle components analysis partitioned the barley germplasm in three subgroups characterized by different row-type and growth habit. A significant association with heading date was detected on chromosome 2HS, where the different alleles of associated markers were able to significantly affect heading date in different cultivars. Moreover, GWAS uncovered a significant association with yield and relative yield under R conditions on chromosome 5HS. These results provide a clue for further analysis on genetic control of barley flowering time and production in response to water stress under Mediterranean dry climate.

AB The gluten proteins of cereals such as bread wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum) and spelt (T. aestivum ssp. spelta) are responsible for celiac disease (CD). The alpha-gliadins constitute the most immunogenic class of gluten proteins as they include four main T-cell stimulatory epitopes that affect CD patients. Spelt has been less studied than bread wheat and could constitute a source of valuable diversity. The objective of this work was to study the genetic diversity of spelta-gliadin transcripts and to compare it with those of bread wheat. Genotyping data from 85 spelt accessions obtained with 19 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to select 11 contrasted accessions, from which 446 full open reading frame alpha-gliadin genes were cloned and sequenced, which revealed a high allelic diversity. High variations among the accessions were highlighted, in terms of the proportion of alpha-gliadin sequences from each of the three genomes (A, B and D), and their composition in the four T-cell stimulatory epitopes. An accession from Tajikistan stood out, having a particularly high proportion of alpha-gliadins from the B genome and a low immunogenic content. Even if no clear separation between spelt and bread wheat sequences was shown, spelt alpha-gliadins displayed specific features concerning e.g. the frequencies of some amino acid substitutions. Given this observation and the variations in toxicity revealed in the spelt accessions in this study, the high genetic diversity held in spelt germplasm collections could be a valuable resource in the development of safer varieties for CD patients.

AB Wheat grain color does not only affect the brightness of flour but also seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance. The transcription factor Tamyb10 is an important candidate for R-1 gene, and the expression of its homologs determines wheat seed coat color. In the present study, the allelic variations of Tamyb10 were explored in a set of Chinese bread wheat varieties and advanced lines with different PHS tolerance, and a sequenced-tagged site (STS) marker for Tamyb10-D1 gene was developed, designated as Tamyb10D, which could be used as an efficient and reliable marker to evaluate the depth dormancy of wheat seeds. Using the marker Tamyb10D, 1629- and 1178-bp PCR fragments were amplified from the tolerant varieties, whereas a 1178-bp fragment was from the susceptible ones. Of the Chinese bread wheat varieties and advanced lines, 103 were used to validate the relationship between the polymorphic fragments of Tamyb10D and PHS tolerance. Statistical analysis indicated that Tamyb10D was significantly (P < 0.001) associatedwith depth of seed dormancy in these germplasms. To further confirm the association between allelic variants of Tamyb10-D1 and PHS tolerance, 200 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross between Zhongyou 9507 (1178-bp fragment) and Yangxiaomai (1178- and 1629-bp fragments) were genotyped using the marker Tamyb10D. General linear model analysis indicated that variation in Tamyb10-D1 had a significant (P < 0.001) association with the germination index (GI) values, explaining 13.7, 4.7, and 9.8 % of the phenotypic variation in GI in Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and the averaged data from those environments, respectively. In addition, among the 103 wheat varieties, 8 Tamyb10 genotypes (Tamybl0-A1, Tamybl0-B1, and Tamyb10-D1 loci) were detected, namely, aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, and bbb, and these were significantly associated with GI value.

AB Water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) in stems play an important role in buffering grain yield in wheat against biotic and abiotic stresses; however, knowledge of genes controlling WSC is very limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high-density 90K SNP array to better understand the genetic basis underlying WSC, and to explore marker-based breeding approaches. WSC was evaluated in an association panel comprising 166 Chinese bread wheat cultivars planted in four environments. Fifty two marker-trait associations (MTAs) distributed across 23 loci were identified for phenotypic best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs), and 11 MTAs were identified in two or more environments. Liner regression showed a clear dependence of WSC BLUE scores on numbers of favorable (increasing WSC content) and unfavorable alleles (decreasing WSC), indicating that genotypes with higher numbers of favorable or lower numbers of unfavorable alleles had higher WSC content. In silico analysis of flanking sequences of trait-associated SNPs revealed eight candidate genes related to WSC content grouped into two categories based on the type of encoding proteins, namely, defense response proteins and proteins triggered by environmental stresses. The identified SNPs and candidate genes related to WSC provide opportunities for breeding higher WSC wheat cultivars.

AB Using bulk segregant analysis (BSA) coupling with RNA-seq and DNA markers identified a potentially novel nitrogen-dependent lesion mimic gene Ndhrl1 on 2BS in wheat.
   Lesion mimic (LM) refers to hypersensitive reaction-like (HRL) traits that appear on leaf tissue in the absence of plant pathogens. In a wheat line P7001, LM showed up on the leaves under the 0 g nitrogen (N) treatment, but disappeared when sufficient N was supplied, suggesting that LM is N-responsive and N dosage dependent. Using BSA strategy together with RNA-seq and DNA markers, we identified an N-dependent LM gene (Ndhrl1) and mapped it to the short arm of chromosome 2B using an F-5 recombinant inbred population developed from the cross of P7001 x P216. The putative gene was delimited into an interval of 8.1 cM flanked by the CAPS/dCAPS markers 7hrC9 and 7hr2dc14, and co-segregated with the dCAPS marker 7hrdc2. This gene is most likely a novel gene for LM in wheat based on its chromosomal location. Further analysis of RNA-seq data showed that plant-pathogen interaction, nitrogen metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were significantly differentially expressed between LM and non-LM lines.

AB Many deletions of the wheat Della ( Rht - B1 ) gene and its flanking regions were isolated in a simple phenotypic screen, and characterised by modified analysis of SNP hybridisation data and cytogenetics.
   In a dwarf wheat suppressor screen, many tall 'revertants' were isolated following mutagenesis of a severely dwarfed (Rht-B1c) hexaploid wheat. About 150 lines were identified as putative deletions of Rht-B1c, based on the PCR analysis. Southern blot hybridisation established that most of them lacked the Rht-B1 gene, but retained the homoeologues Rht-A1 and Rht-D1. PCR assays were developed for orthologues of two genes that flank Rht-1/Della in the genomes of the model species Brachypodium and rice. Deletion of the B-genome-specific homoeologues of these two genes was confirmed in the Rht-B1 deletion lines, indicating loss of more than a single gene. SNP chip hybridisation analysis established the extents of deletion in these lines. Based on the synteny with Brachypodium chromosomes 1 and 4 g, and rice chromosomes 3g and 11g, notional deletion maps were established. The deletions ranged from interstitial deletions of 4BS through to loss of all 4BS markers. There were also instances, where all 4BS and 4BL markers were lost, and these lines had poor fertility and narrow stems and leaves. Cytogenetic studies on selected lines confirmed the loss of portions of 4BS in lines that lacked most or all 4BS markers. They also confirmed that lines lacking both 4BS and 4BL markers were nullisomics for 4B. These nested deletion lines share a common genetic background and will have applications in assigning markers to regions of 4BS as well as to 4BL. The potential for this type of analysis in other regions of the wheat genome is discussed.

AB A gene for Ug99 resistance from wheat landrace CItr 4311 was detected on the long arm of chromosome 2B.
   Wheat landrace CItr 4311 has seedling resistance to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK and field resistance to the Ug99 race group. Parents, F-1 seedlings, 121 doubled haploid (DH) lines, and 124 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between CItr 4311 and the susceptible line LMPG-6 were evaluated for seedling resistance to race TTKSK. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that a single dominant gene in CItr 4311 conditioned the TTKSK resistance. The 90 K wheat iSelect SNP platform was used to genotype parents and the DH population. The seedling resistance locus was mapped to the chromosome arm 2BL. Parents and the DH population were evaluated for field resistance in Kenya. One major QTL for the field resistance was consistently detected in the same region on 2BL as the seedling resistance. Using KASP assays, five linked SNP markers were used to verify the result in the 124 RIL, 35 wheat accessions, 46 DH lines from the LMPG-6/PI 165194 cross and F-1 seedlings, and susceptible bulks derived from crosses between six resistant landraces with LMPG-6. Race specificity, mapping results, and haplotype similarity with lines with Sr9h (Gabo 56, Timstein, and PI 670015), support the hypothesis that the Sr gene in CItr 4311 and the landraces is Sr9h. The KASP assays developed in this study will be useful for pyramiding the TTKSK resistance from CItr 4311 with other Sr genes effective against Ug99.

AB Resistance to Ug99 stem rust in Triumph 64 was conferred by SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS and was mapped to the same position as SrCad and Sr42 , however, the three genes show functional differences.
   Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is an important disease of wheat that can be controlled by effective stem rust resistance (Sr) genes. The emergence of virulent Pgt races in Africa, namely Ug99 and its variants, has stimulated the search for new Sr genes and genetic characterization of known sources of resistance. Triumph 64 is a winter wheat cultivar that carries gene SrTmp, which confers resistance to Ug99. The goals of this study were to genetically map SrTmp and examine its relationship with other Sr genes occupying a similar chromosome location. A doubled haploid (DH) population from the cross LMPG-6S/Triumph 64 was inoculated with Ug99 at the seedling stage. A single gene conditioning resistance to Ug99 segregated in the population. Genetic mapping with SSR markers placed SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS in a region similar to SrCad and Sr42. SNP markers developed for SrCad were used to further map SrTmp and were also added to a genetic map of Sr42 using a DH population (LMPG-6S/Norin 40). Three SNP markers that co-segregated with SrTmp also co-segregated with SrCad and Sr42. The SNP markers showed no difference in the map locations of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42. Multi-race testing with DH lines from the Triumph 64 and Norin 40 populations and a recombinant inbred-line population from the cross LMPG-6S/AC Cadillac showed that SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42 confer different spectra of resistance. Markers closely linked to SrTmp are suitable for marker-assisted breeding and germplasm development.

AB Although the Burgundy truffle (Tuber aestivum) is an ectomycorrhizal fungus of important economic value, its subterranean life cycle and population biology are still poorly understood. Here, we determine mating type and simple sequence repeat (SSR) maternal genotypes of mapped fruiting bodies to assess their genetic structure within two naturally colonized forest sites in southern Germany. Forty-one genotypes were identified from 112 fruiting bodies. According to their mating types, the maternal genotypes were aggregated only in one population. Genotypic diversity of individuals that mostly were small and occurred in 1 out of 2 years of sampling was high. Although these results suggested a ruderal colonization strategy, some genets spread several hundred meters. This result indicates that, besides sexual spore dispersal, vegetative growth or spreading by mycelial propagules contributes to dissemination. In one site, fewer individuals with a tendency to expand genets belonging to only one genetic group were observed. In the second site, numerous small individuals were found and were grouped into two clearly differentiated genetic groups that were spatially intermingled. Forest characteristics and disturbances are possible reasons for the observed genetic patterns. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the biology of one of the most widespread and commercially important truffle species. This knowledge is critical for establishing and maintaining sustainable long-term truffle cultivations.

AB Mining of new genetic resources is of paramount importance to combat the alarming spread of stripe rust disease and breakdown of major resistance genes in wheat. We conducted a genome wide association study on 352 un-utilized Afghan wheat landraces against stripe rust resistance in eight locations. High level of disease variation was observed among locations and a core-set of germplasm showed consistence performance. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed rapidly (R-2 approximate to 0.16 at 0 cM) due to germplasm peerless diversity. The mixed linear model resulted in ten marker-trait associations (MTAs) across all environments representing five QTL. The extensively short LD blocks required us to repeat the analysis with less diverse subset of 220 landraces in which R-2 decayed below 0.2 at 0.3 cM. The subset GWAS resulted in 36 MTAs clustered in nine QTL. The subset analysis validated three QTL previously detected in the full list analysis. Overall, the study revealed that stripe rust epidemics in the geographical origin of this germplasm through time have permitted for selecting novel resistance loci. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB A Thinopyrum intermedium x Thinopyrum ponticum synthetic hybrid wheatgrass is an excellent source of leaf and stem rust resistance produced by N.V.Tsitsin. Wheat line Mv9kr1 was crossed with this hybrid (Agropyron glael) in Hungary in order to transfer its advantageous agronomic traits into wheat. As the wheat parent was susceptible to leaf rust, the transfer of resistance was easily recognizable in the progenies. Three different partial amphiploid lines with leaf rust resistance were selected from the wheat/Thinopyrum hybrid derivatives by multicolour genomic in situ hybridization. Chromosome counting on the partial amphiploids revealed 58 chromosomes (18 wheatgrass) in line 194, 56 (14 wheatgrass) in line 195 and 54 (12 wheatgrass) in line 196. The wheat chromosomes present in these lines were identified and the wheatgrass chromosomes were characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the repetitive DNA probes Afa-family, pSc119.2 and pTa71. The 3D wheat chromosome was missing from the lines. Molecular marker analysis showed the presence of the Lr24 leaf rust resistance gene in lines 195 and 196. The morphological traits were evaluated in the field during two consecutive seasons in two different locations.

AB Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is an efficient method of genotyping in numerous plant species. One of the crucial steps toward the application of GBS markers in crop improvement is anchoring them on particular chromosomes. In rye (Secale cereale L.), chromosomal localization of GBS markers has not yet been reported. In this paper, the application of GBS markers generated by the DArTseq platform for extending the high-density map of rye is presented. Additionally, their application is used for the localization of the Rfc1 gene that restores male fertility in plants with the C source of sterility-inducing cytoplasm. The total number of markers anchored on the current version of the map is 19,081, of which 18,132 were obtained from the DArTseq platform. Numerous markers co-segregated within the studied mapping population, so, finally, only 3397 unique positions were located on the map of all seven rye chromosomes. The total length of the map is 1593 cM and the average distance between markers is 0.47 cM. In spite of the resolution of the map being not very high, it should be a useful tool for further studies of the Secale cereale genome because of the presence on this map of numerous GBS markers anchored for the first time on rye chromosomes. The Rfc1 gene was located on high-density maps of the long arm of the 4R chromosome obtained for two mapping populations. Genetic maps were composed of DArT, DArTseq, and PCR-based markers. Consistent mapping results were obtained and DArTs tightly linked to the Rfc1 gene were successfully applied for the development of six new PCR-based markers useful in marker-assisted selection.

AB Wild relatives, landraces and cultivars from different geographical regions have been demonstrated as the sources of genetic variation for resistance to rust diseases. This study involved assessment of diversity for resistance to three rust diseases among a set of Nordic spring wheat cultivars. These cultivars were tested at the seedling stage against several pathotypes of three rust pathogens in the greenhouse. All stage stem rust resistance genes Sr7b, Sr8a, Sr12, Sr15, Sr17, Sr23 and Sr30, and leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr3a, Lr13, Lr14a, Lr16 and Lr20 were postulated either singly or in different combinations among these cultivars. A high proportion of cultivars were identified to carry linked rust resistance genes Sr15 and Lr20. Although 51 cultivars showed variation against Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) pathotypes used in this study, results were not clearly contrasting to enable postulation of stripe rust resistance genes in these genotypes. Stripe rust resistance gene Yr27 was postulated in four cultivars and Yr1 was present in cultivar Zebra. Cultivar Tjalve produced low stripe rust response against all Pst pathotypes indicating the presence either of a widely effective resistance gene or combination of genes with compensating pathogenic specificities. Several cultivars carried moderate to high level of APR to leaf rust and stripe rust. Seedling stem rust susceptible cultivar Aston exhibited moderately resistant to moderately susceptible response, whereas other cultivars belonging to this class were rated moderately susceptible or higher. Molecular markers linked with APR genes Yr48, Lr34/Yr18/Sr57, Lr68 and Sr2 detected the presence of these genes in some genotypes.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for barley stripe rust resistance were mapped in recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a 'Lenetah' x 'Grannelose Zweizeilige' (GZ) cross. GZ is known for a major seedling resistance QTL on chromosome 4H but linked markers suitable for marker-assisted selection have not been developed. This study identified the 4H QTL (log of the likelihood [LOD] = 15.94 at 97.19 centimorgans [cM]), and additional QTL on chromosomes 4H and 6H (LOD = 5.39 at 72.7 cM and 4.24 at 34.46 cM, respectively). A QTL on chromosome 7H (LOD = 2.04 at 81.07 cM) was suggested. All resistance alleles were derived from GZ. Evaluations of adult plant response in Corvallis, OR in 2013 and 2015 provided evidence of QTL at the same positions. However, the minor QTL on 4H was not statistically significant in either location/year, while the 7H QTL was significant in both. The single-nucleotide polymorphism markers flanking the resistance QTL were validated in RIL from a '95SR316A' x GZ cross for their ability to predict seedling resistance. In 95SR316A x GZ, 91 to 92% of RIL with GZ alleles at the major 4H QTL and at least one other were resistant to moderate in reaction. In these populations, at least two QTL were required to transfer the barley stripe rust resistance from GZ.

AB Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, can cause severe yield losses on susceptible wheat varieties and cultivars. Although stem rust can be controlled by the use of genetic resistance, population dynamics of P. graminis f. sp. tritici can frequently lead to defeat of wheat stem rust resistance genes. P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TKTTF caused a severe epidemic in Ethiopia on Ug99-resistant 'Digalu' in 2013 and 2014. The gene Sr11 confers resistance to race TKTTF and is present in 'Gabo 56'. We identified seven single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to Sr11 from a cross between Gabo 56 and 'Chinese Spring' exploiting a 90K Infinium iSelect Custom beadchip. Five SNP markers were validated on a 'Berkut/'Scalavatis' population that segregated for Sill, using KBioscience competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) assays. Two of the SNP markers, KASP_6BL_IWB10724 and ICASP_6BL_IWB72471, were predictive of Sr11 among wheat genetic stocks, cultivars, and breeding lines from North America, Ethiopia, and Pakistan. These markers can be utilized to select for Sr11 in wheat breeding and to detect the presence of Sr11 in uncharacterized germplasm.

AB To evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among Thinopyrum species and Triticum species, 7 accessions of Thinopyrum species (2 Th. bessarabicum, 1 Th. elongatum, 2 Th. intermedium and 2. Th. ponticum), 11 accessions of Triticum species (2 Aeglips tauschii, 1 T. monococcum, 1 T. turgidum, 2 T. timopheevii and 5 T. aestivum) together with Hordeum vulgare cv. Golden were analysed using 17 SCoT and 10 CDDP markers. The mean number of observed alleles was 8.5 and 6.6 among the species for SCoT and CDDP markers, respectively. Based on the genetic data produced by the SCoT and CDDP markers, cluster analysis among Thinopyrum species, Triticum species and Hordeum was performed to generate dendrograms. The genetic relationships among Thinopyrum species, Triticum species and H. vulgare revealed by the SCoT markers were in agreement with the results of the CDDP markers. On both dendrograms, these species formed three clusters. The results indicated that Thinopyrum species and Triticum species were the most closely related, whereas H. vulgare was relatively distant from both genera. In addition, seven markers, i.e. SCoT 9, SCoT 31, SCoT 34, WRKY-R1, WRKY-R2, MADS-1 and MADS-4 were developed for monitoring introgression of Thinopyrum chromosomes or chromosome segments into Triticum species.

AB Stem rust is one of the most potentially harmful wheat diseases, but has been effectively controlled in China since 1970s. However, the interest in breeding wheat with durable resistance to stem rust has been renewed with the emergence of Ug99 (TTKSK) virulent to the widely used resistance gene Sr31, and by which the wheat stem rust was controlled for 40 years in wheat production area worldwide. Yunnan Province, located on the Southwest border of China, is one of the main wheat growing regions, playing a pivotal role in the wheat stem rust epidemic in China. This study investigated the levels of resistance in key wheat cultivars (lines) of Yunnan Province. In addition, the existence of Sr25, Sr26, Sr28, Sr31, Sr32, and Sr38 genes in 119 wheat cultivars was assessed using specific DNA markers. The results indicated that 77 (64.7%) tested wheat varieties showed different levels of resistance to all the tested races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Using molecular markers, we identified the resistance gene Sr31 in 43 samples; Sr38 in 10 samples; Sr28 in 12 samples, and one sample which was resistant against Ug99 (avirulent to Sr32). No Sr25 or Sr26 (effective against Ug99) was identified in any cultivars tested. Furthermore, 5 out of 119 cultivars tested carried both Sr31 and Sr38 and eight contained both Sr31 and Sr28. The results enable the development of appropriate strategies to breed varieties resistant to stem rust.

AB Cleistogamous and chasmogamous are two opposing phenomena for flowering in barley. Cleistogamy limits the rate of outcrossing, and increases the cost of producing hybrid barley seeds. Selecting chasmogamous lines with a large glume opening angle (GOA) is essential for the utilization of barley heterosis. In the current study, 247 DH lines derived from a cross between Yangnongpi7 and Yang0187 were used to identify and validate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the GOA in different environments using SSR markers. Three QTLs associated with barley GOA were mapped on chromosomes 2H and 7H. The major QTL QGOA-2H-2 was mapped on chromosome 2H with the flanking markers of KDH and GBM1498, explaining 63.92% of the phenotypic variation. The marker KDH was developed from the gene Cly1, which was the candidate gene for QGOA-2H-2. This new marker can be used to identify barley chasmogamous lines with a large GOA. The two minor QTLs were validated at all three locations across two seasons after removing DH lines carrying the candidate gene Cly1 of QGOA-2H-2.
