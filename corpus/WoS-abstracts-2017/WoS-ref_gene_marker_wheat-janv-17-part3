AB A recent survey of worldwide isolates of Stagonospora nodorum showed that all Australian isolates expressed the host-specific toxin ToxA (Stukenbrock and McDonald 2007). In contrast, very few Chinese isolates did. All the Australian Pyrenophora tritici-repentis isolates that were tested expressed ToxA. We therefore postulated that the wheat gene that confers sensitivity to ToxA, Tsn1, would vary in prevalence in wheat cultivars in use in the two countries. Contrary to expectation, 10 out of 21 Chinese cultivars responded to ToxA as did 26 out of 46 Australian cultivars. The result suggests that ToxA has not had a determining effect on the survival of wheat cultivars in either country. They also suggest that despite the widespread use of Tsn1 markers in Australia, sensitive alleles are still commonplace. The removal of sensitive alleles from breeders' lines could be readily achieved and could significantly affect the resistance of wheat to both diseases.

AB The photoperiod sensitivity gene Ppd-D1 and the vernalisation genes Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1 are known to contribute to optimal adaptation to specific environments. Diagnostic molecular markers for detecting important alleles of these genes are now available, including for 2 distinct spring alleles of Vrn-A1 (a and b). As a first step for determining the relative importance of these alleles, they were characterised in Australian cultivars released from the late 19th until the early 21st Century.
   The photoperiod-insensitive Ppd-D1a allele did not occur in the Australian cultivars we assessed until after the release of cultivars containing CIMMYT germplasm in 1973. Thereafter, this allele became common; however, cultivars with an alternative, presumably photoperiod-sensitive, allele have continued to be released for all parts of the Australian wheatbelt, including for latitudes less than 28 degrees S. In contrast to other parts of the world, Vrn-A1b was frequent in cultivars released during the first 70 years of the 20th Century and is still present in modern cultivars. Before the use of CIMMYT germplasm, the spring allele of Vrn-B1 and the winter allele of Vrn-D1 were common.
   Four major combinations of alleles of these major genes were identified in modern cultivars: first, those similar to WW15 (Anza), with the Ppd-D1a allele, the spring Vrn-A1a allele, and winter alleles at Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1; second, those similar to Spear or Kite, with the alternative, photoperiod-sensitive allele at Ppd-D1, the spring Vrn-A1a allele, the spring Vrn-B1a allele, and the winter allele at Vrn-D1; third, those similar to Pavon F 76, with the Ppd-D1a allele, the winter allele at Vrn-A1, and the spring alleles at Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1; fourthly, those similar to Gabo, with the winter allele at Vrn-A1, the spring allele at Vrn-B1, the winter allele at Vrn-D1, but the Ppd-D1a allele. Other combinations were found, including those for winter cultivars and those for early heading cultivars. A hypothesis was suggested for the facultative cv. Oxley. Evidence was presented to suggest that modern full-season cultivars head similar to 1 week earlier in a Mallee environment than cultivars from the late 19th Century.

AB The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-Aegilops geniculata introgression T5DL.5DS-5M(g)S(0.95), with stripe rust resistance gene Yr40 and leaf rust resistance gene Lr57, is an effective source of resistance against most isolates of the rust pathogen in Kansas and India. Rust resistance genes Lr57 and Yr40 were transferred to the hard red winter wheat (HRWW) cultivars Jagger and Overley by standard backcrossing and marker-assisted selection (MAS). PCR-based cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed and used to select backcross F, plants with rust resistance. Diagnostic polymorphism detected by CAPS marker XLr57/Yr40-MAS-CAPS16 was consistent between the resistant source and a set of wheat cultivars selected by the U.S. Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Project. Homozygous BC3F2 plants with rust resistance genes were selected using the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP)-based diagnostic DNA marker polymorphism detected by the wheat grain softness protein (GSP). Deletion of Puroindoline a (Pina-M(g)1) and Puroindoline b (Pinb-M(g)1) gene sequences in the chromosome segment of 5M(g)S substituting for 5DS of wheat suggests that the backcross derivatives with Lr57/Yr40 can be used to develop hard textured wheats. The HRWW germplasm with Lr57 and Yr40 will provide breeders in the Southern Great Plains with adapted lines having an additional source of resistance that can be used to achieve durability of rust resistance.

AB Public concerns about crop uniformity introduced by modern plant breeding and genetic vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses have been one of the major forces driving long-term efforts in plant germplasm conservation for future food security. However, such concerns have gained little empirical support, as recent molecular diversity analyses of improved crop gene pools did not reveal much reduction from early to recent breeding efforts. We conducted a genome-wide examination of 75 Canadian hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars released from 1845 to 2004 using 370 simple sequence repeat (or SSR) markers that were widely distributed over all 21 wheat chromosomes. A total of 2280 SSR alleles were detected. Allelic reduction occurred in every part of the wheat genome and a majority of the reduced alleles resided in only a few early cultivars. Significant allelic reduction started in the 1930s. Considering 2010 SSR alleles detected in the 20 earliest cultivars, 38% of them were retained, 18% were new, and 44% were lost in the 20 most recent cultivars. The net reduction of the total SSR variation in 20 recent cultivars was 17%. This clear-cut evidence not only supports the contention that modern plant breeding reduces the genetic diversity of Canadian wheat, but also underlies the need for conserving wheat germplasm and introducing genetic diversity into wheat breeding.

AB The reaction of winter and spring wheat to infection with barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV) was evaluated in three-year small-plot field trials on 71 wheat varieties registered in the Czech Republic and at two locations for two years on 63 selected potential sources of resistance. Disease symptoms (VSS) were visually recorded using a 0-9 scale and the percent reduction of grain weight per spike (GWS-R) was measured on twenty plants per plot. The evaluation showed that among the registered varieties of winter and spring wheat no variety had a high resistance to BYDV (with VSS lower than 3.5). GWS-R ranged between 24% and 60%. Higher variability in VSS was detected for the registered varieties of spring wheat compared to winter wheat. Among the registered varieties of winter wheat, Saskia, Rialto, Meritto, Rexia, and Svitava, as well as the spring wheat Leguan, received the best long-term evaluations. The highest level of resistance was detected for the PSR 3628 line (a hybrid of wheat and couch-grass), but in connection with a low agronomic value. The WKL91-138 line of spring wheat and some varieties (lines) with the detected moderate level of resistance, in particular, could offer good prospects for use in breeding. The presence of the Bdv2 gene was expressed only in the reduction of virus content on the 11(th) day after inoculation. Nevertheless, genotypes carrying this gene were evaluated in field trials as susceptible or very susceptible to infection with the Czech PAV isolate. Similarly, the presence of the Bdv1 gene detected with the help of WMS130 marker was no assurance of an increased level of resistance to BYDV. Hybridological analyses of crosses with the WKL91-138 line showed a polygenic nature of inheritance. Thus, the marker-assisted selection does not obviously promise Success without a focus on detecting a larger number of QTLs.

AB To better understand molecular evolution of the large alpha-gliadin gene family and provide a potential value for wheat quality improvement, total 32 alpha-gliadin gene sequences were isolated from the two Dasypyrum species, D. villosum. (L.) Candargy and D. breviaristatum (Lindb. F.) Frederisksen. Twelve of 32 sequences contained the in-frame stop condons were predicted to be pseudogenes, suggesting the high variation of gliadin genes in Dasypyrum genome. There are five D. breviaristatum alpha-gliadin sequences present additional cysteine residues. Four peptides which have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in celiac disease (CD) patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8 were searched to all Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin gene sequences, and we found that the distribution of the epitopes varied between Dasypyrum genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin genes indicated that the sequences from D. breviaristatum displayed higher variation than those from D. villosum, and the genomic differentiation occurred between the two Dasypyrum species. Moreover, the promoter region of the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin genes consisted of four different lengths, indicative of the retrotransposons involving the evolution of the gliadin gene promoters. Based on the specific sequences of the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin promoter region, we produced sequence-characterized amplified region ( SCAR) markers, and localized the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin genes on chromosome 6 VS. The SCAR markers can be used to target the introgression of Dasypyrum

AB Photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 is a primary source of carbon in soil and root exudates and can influence the community dynamics of rhizosphere organisms. Thus, if carbon partitioning is affected in transgenic crops, rhizosphere microbial communities may also be affected. In this study, the temporal effects of gene transformation on carbon partitioning in rice and rhizosphere microbial communities were investigated under greenhouse conditions using the C-13 pulse-chase labeling method and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The C-13 contents in leaves of transgenic (Bt) and nontransgenic (Ck) rice were significantly different at the seedling, booting and heading stages. There were no detectable differences in C-13 distribution in rice roots and rhizosphere microorganisms at any point during rice development. Although a significantly lower amount of Gram-positive bacterial PLFAs and a higher amount of Gram-negative bacterial PLFAs were observed in Bt rice rhizosphere as compared with Ck at all plant development stages, there were no significant differences in the amount of individual C-13-PLFA between Bt and Ck rhizospheres at any growing stage. These findings indicate that the insertion of cry1Ab and marker genes into rice had no persistent or adverse effect on the photosynthate distribution in rice or the microbial community composition in its rhizosphere.

AB Genetic diversity of a set of 71 wheat accessions, including 53 biotype 2 Russian wheat aphid (RWA2)-resistant landraces and 18 RWA2 susceptible accessions, was assessed by examining molecular variation at multiple microsatellite (SSR) loci. Fifty-one wheat SSR primer pairs were used, 81 SSR loci were determined, and 545 SSR alleles were detected. These SSR loci covered all the three genomes, 21 chromosomes, and at least 41 of the 42 chromosome arms. Diversity values averaged over SSR loci were high with mean number of SSR alleles/locus = 6.7, mean Shannon's index (H) = 1.291, and mean Nei's gene diversity (He) = 0.609. The three wheat genomes ranked as A > D > B and the homoeologous groups ranked as 7 > 3 > 1 > 2 > 6 > 5 > 4 based on the number of alleles per locus. Xgwm136 on chromosome arm 1AS is the most polymorphic SSR locus with the largest number of observed and effective alleles and the highest H and He. Among all 2485 pairs of wheat accessions, genetic distance (GD) ranged from 0.054 to 1.933 and averaged 0.9832. A dendrogram based on GD matrix showed that all the wheat accessions could be grouped into distinct clusters. Most of the susceptible cultivars (13/18) were clustered into groups that contains all or mostly susceptible accessions. Most of the U.S. cultivars belong to a group that is distinguishable from all the different RWA2 resistant groups. Diversity analysis was also conducted separately for subgroups containing 53 RWA2-resistant accessions and 18 RWA2-susceptible accessions. Association mapping revealed 28 SSR loci significantly associated with leaf chlorosis, and 8 with leaf rolling. New chromosome regions associated with RWA2 resistance were detected, and indicated existence of new RWA resistance genes located on chromosomes of all other homoeologous groups in addition to the groups 1 and 7 in bread wheat. This information is helpful for development of mapping populations for RWA2 resistance genes from different phylogenetic groups, and for wise utilization of the RWA-resistant germplasm in wheat breeding programs.

AB To map important ESTs to specific chromosomes and (or) chromosomal regions is difficult in hexaploid wheat because of its large genome size and serious interference of homoeologous sequences. Large-scale EST sequencing and subsequent chromosome localization are both laborious and time-consuming. The wheat alien addition line TAi-27 contains a pair of chromosomes of Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey that carry the resistance gene against barley yellow dwarf virus. In this research, we developed a modified technique based on chromosome microdissection and hybridization-specific amplification to isolate expressed sequences from the alien chromosome of TAi-27 by hybridization between the DNA of the microdissected alien chromosome and cDNA of Th. intermedium infected by barley yellow dwarf virus. Twelve clones were selected, sequenced, and analyzed. Three of them were unknown genes without any hit in the GenBank database and the other nine were highly homologous with ESTs of wheat, barley, and (or) other plants in Gramineae induced by abiotic or biotic stress. The method used in this research to isolate expressed sequences from a specific chromosome has the following advantages: (i) the obtained expressed sequences are larger in size and have 3' end information and (ii) the operation is less complicated. It would be an efficient improved method for genomics and functional genomics research of polyploid plants, especially for EST development and mapping. The obtained expressed sequence data are also informative in understanding the resistance genes on the alien chromosome of TAi-27.

ID MALE-STERILITY; MAP; L.
AB A male sterile wheat mutant, Triticum aestivum L. 'Taigu', was found in a wheat field in China in 1972. The male sterility was controlled by a single dominant gene that was referred to as Ms2. Recently, this gene was found to be linked to a dwarfing gene through crossing Taigu with the short wheat T. aestivum 'Ai-Bian 1' carrying the dwarfing gene Rht-D1c. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers linked to the male sterility Ms2 gene in common wheat. One hundred and twenty-two near-isogenic lines were developed through backcrossing and sib intercrossing and used as the mapping population for the development of molecular markers. Bulked segregant analysis was used to screen 48 pairs of SSR primers, and a marker, MS2-WMC617, was identified closely linked to the male sterile Ms2 gene that mapped at the distal position of chromosome arm 4DS. The use of the molecular marker MS2-WMC617 can facilitate recurrent selection in a wheat breeding program based on marker-assisted selection.

AB We studied the effects of different environmental conditions on morphological and genetic variations in the Mediterranean geophyte Asphodelus aestivus in Israel. The study included six populations, ranging from mesic Mediterranean to and ecosystems. The results showed important differential morphological traits in one population of the Mediterranean ecosystem (M1). They included longer leaves, longer inflorescences-stalks, and larger number of flower buds than those found among the other populations. We used RAPD analysis to get a genetic profile for all studied populations: 30 loci revealed by the use of 11 primers were studied on 30 plants from each study site. No unique allele was found. Nevertheless, the M1 population was always different from the others in several molecular markers, and even created a different clade on the phylogenetic tree. Abiotic factors were considered to have caused the differentiation of the M1 population. A contingency chi(2) test for heterogeneity of RAPID frequencies across all locations revealed significant differences in 17 RAPD loci (57%). The estimated genetic diversity within populations was 0.287 according to Nei's gene diversity and 0.432 according to Shannon's genetic diversity index. Differentiation among six populations of the RAPD loci (G(ST)) ranged from 0.014 to 0.354 with a mean of 0.096. Principal coordinate analysis indicated the presence of genetically distinct sub-regional groups. Genetic and geographical distances among A. aestivus populations along the environmental gradient were found to be correlated, with the exception of the M1 population. In the present study, levels of gene variability within populations were higher than those between populations. Nevertheless, if we discard the unique M1 population, a clear genetic pattern linked to aridity and geographical distance was discerned.

AB Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) can Cause Significant losses of wheat worldwide. The long arm segment of Thinopyrum intermedium chromosome 7Ai#1 carrying the BYDV resistance gene Bdv2 was translocated to the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 7D in translocation line Yw642. In this study, 40 wheat EST sequences located in the distal region of 7DL were explored to identify specific PCR markers for the Bdv2 region on the basis of the homoeologous relationship between wheat chromosome 7D and Th. intermedium chromosome 7Ai#1. Our results revealed 8 novel EST-PCR markers specific to the Bdv2 region, including 5 EST-STS markers of BE404744, BE498985, BE591497, BG606695 and BQ161842, and 3 EST-SSCP markers of BE404953, BG312663 and BE498985. These EST-PCR markers could distinguish Bdv2 from another BYDV-resistance gene located on Th. intermedium chromosome 2Ai-2. These specific bands for the Bdv2 region were further cloned and sequenced. The sequencing analysis indicated that the specific sequences for the Bdv2 region were highly homologous with the original wheat EST sequences that were used to design primers, and encode respectively a protein kinase, P450, centrin, transducin, and a hypothetical protein. This study created a starting point for eventual cloning of the Bdv2 gene and understanding the defense mechanism.

AB Inheritance of partial leaf rust and stripe rust resistance of a Thatcher wheat 90RN2491, earlier reported to carry two doses of the gene pair Lr34-Yr18 and the reference line RL6058 (6*Thatcher/P158548) for the Lr34-Yr18 gene pair was studied against predominant and highly virulent Indian races. Thatcher derivatives 90RN2491 and RL6058 were intercrossed as well as crossed with the leaf rust and stripe rust susceptible Indian cultivar WL711. The F(1), F(2) and F(3) generations from these crosses were assessed for rust severity against leaf rust race 77-5 and stripe rust race 46S 119. The F(2) and F(3) generations from the crosses of RL6058 and 90RN2491 with WL711, segregated 15 resistant : 1 Susceptible (F(2)) and 7 homozygous resistant : 8 segregating : 1 homozygous susceptible (F(3)) ratios, respectively, both for leaf rust and stripe rust severity. Therefore, partial resistance against each of the leaf rust and stripe rust races in both RL6058 and 90RN2491 is ascribed to two independently inherited dominant genes. One of the two genes for leaf rust and stripe rust resistance in 90RN2491 and RL6058 is Lr34 and the linked gene Yr18, respectively. The second leaf rust resistance gene in both the Thatcher lines segregated independently of stripe rust resistance. Therefore, it is not Lr34 and it remains unidentified.

AB 'Mace' (Reg. No. CV-1027, P1 651043) hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed by the USDA-ARS and the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and released in December 2007. Mace was selected from the cross Yuma//PI 372129/3/CO850034/4/4*Yuma/5/(KS91H184/Arlin S//KS91HW29/3/NE89526). Mace primarily was released for its resistance to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and adaptation to rainfed and irrigated wheat production systems in Nebraska and adjacent areas in the northern Great Plains. Mace was derived from a head selection made from a heterogeneous, in terms of field resistance to WSMV, F(5) line. Resistance to WSMV is conditioned by the Wsm-1 gene, located on an introgressed chromosome arm from Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey [Agropyron intermedium (Horst.) Beauv] present as a 4DL.4AgS chromosomal translocation. Mace was tested under the experimental designation N02Y5117.

AB Immature embryos have been used frequently as target tissues in the genetical transformation of wheat. However, obtaining a large number of high quality immature embryos throughout the year is a laborious and delicate process, because of the need to cultivate the plants under controlled conditions. To circumvent this, we have employed mature embryos rather than immature ones as starter explants for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of an elite wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar EM12. The neomycin phosphotransferase II (npt II) and beta-glucuronidase (gus) genes were used as selectable and screenable marker genes, respectively, to assess and optimize the performance of T-DNA delivery. With the aid of an orthogonal design, the effect of four factors in combination on transfer DNA (T-DNA) delivery was studied. These factors were preculture duration, different kinds of inoculation, length of inoculation and co-culture condition. Optimal conditions for T-DNA delivery were obtained for mature embryos precultured for 14 days, followed by immersing in inoculation suspension with full strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts in darkness at 23-25 degrees C for 3 h, and then co-culturing with Agrobacterium under desiccating condition in the dark at 23-24 degrees C for 2-3 days. Complete analysis of transgene insertion demonstrated that the optimized method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of mature embryos of wheat was efficient and practicable.

AB In this study, we developed 359 detection primers for single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) previously discovered within intron sequences of wheat genes and used them to evaluate SNP polymorphism in common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). These SNPs showed an average polymorphism information content (PIC) of 0.18 among 20 US elite wheat cultivars, representing seven market classes. This value increased to 0.23 when SNPs were pre-selected for polymorphisms among a diverse set of 13 hexaploid wheat accessions ( excluding synthetic wheats) used in the wheat SNP discovery project (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/SNP). PIC values for SNP markers in the D genome were approximately half of those for the A and B genomes. D genome SNPs also showed a larger PIC reduction relative to the other genomes (P < 0.05) when US cultivars were compared with the more diverse set of 13 wheat accessions. Within those accessions, D genome SNPs show a higher proportion of alleles with low minor allele frequencies (< 0.125) than found in the other two genomes. These data suggest that the reduction of PIC values in the D genome was caused by differential loss of low frequency alleles during the population size bottleneck that accompanied the development of modern commercial cultivars. Additional SNP discovery efforts targeted to the D genome in elite wheat germplasm will likely be required to offset the lower diversity of this genome. With increasing SNP discovery projects and the development of high-throughput SNP assay technologies, it is anticipated that SNP markers will play an increasingly important role in wheat genetics and breeding applications.

AB The wheat-Stagonospora nodorum patho-system involves a number of pathogen-produced host-selective toxins that interact with host genes in an inverse gene-for-gene manner to cause disease. The wheat intervarietal recombinant inbred population derived from BR34 and Grandin (BG population) segregates for the toxin sensitivity genes Tsn1, Snn2, and Snn3, which confer sensitivity to the toxins ToxA, SnTox2, and SnTox3, respectively. Here, we report the addition of 141 molecular markers to the BG population linkage maps, the identification and/or development of markers tightly linked to Tsn1 and Snn2, and the validation of the markers using a set of diverse wheat accessions. The BG population maps now contain 787 markers, and new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers closely linked to Snn2 on chromosome arm 2DS were identified. In an effort to target more markers to the Snn2 locus, STS markers were developed from 2DS bin-mapped ESTs resulting in the development and mapping of 36 markers mostly to the short arms of group 2 chromosomes. Together, SSR and EST-STS markers delineated Snn2 to a 4.0 cM interval. SSRs developed in related work for Tsn1 were mapped in the BG population and delineated the gene to a 1.0 cM interval. Evaluation of the markers for Tsn1 and Snn2 in a diverse set of wheat genotypes validated their utility for marker-assisted selection, which is particularly efficient for removing toxin sensitivity alleles from elite germ-plasm and varieties.

AB Expressed sequence tags derived simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs), are different from traditional genomic SSR (gSSR) markers. They are more likely to be embedded in the functional gene sequences, less costly and time effective, and may provide abundant information. By analysis of 10,018 expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) out of 10,829 for rubber tree ( Hevea brasiliensis) available in public domain DNA databases, 799 SSR loci were found in the 643 non-redundant SSR-ESTs (SSR-containing ESTs), corresponding to one SSR in every 2.25 kb of the ESTs in rubber tree transcriptome. Of the total 799 SSRs in these ESTs, 673 (84.2%) contained simple repeat motifs while 126 (15.8%) represented compound motif types. Of the total EST-SSRs, 45.3% (362/799) were mononucleotide repeats (MNRs), 42.2% (337/799) were dinucleotide repeats (DNRs), 11.9% (95/799) were trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) and 0.6% (5/799) were tetranucleotide repeats (TTNRs) and hexanucleotide repeats (HNRs). The repeat motifs AAG and AG were the most abundant without regard to single nucleotide repeat. A total of 184 primer pairs were successful designed based on the non-redundant SSR-ESTs. Using 55 degrees C as annealing temperature, 110 primer pairs successfully amplified 12 H. brasiliensis cultivated varieties and four related species. Analysis on 74 alleles amplified by 30 randomly selected primer pairs indicated the medium polymorphism of the EST-SSRs developed. Based on 272 alleles detected by 87 EST-SSR markers, an assessment of genetic diversity was carried out on 12 H. brasiliensis cultivated varieties and four related species. In addition, investigation based on five selected EST-SSRs by cloning and sequencing cross some cultivated species and related species provided evidence for cross-species/genera transferability of the EST-SSR markers developed in this study.

DE Triticum aesticum; Polyphenol oxidase; STS markers
ID NOODLE COLOR; PPO; BREAD
AB Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in grain is regarded as a major factor resulting in time-dependent darkening of wheat end products, particularly for Asian noodles and steamed bread. Breeding wheat cultivars with low PPO activity using efficient and reliable markers is one of the best ways to reduce the undesirable darkening. In the present study, we developed a gene-specific marker (PPO05) for low PPO activity from the sequence AY515506. This marker detected double PCR fragments (< 750 and > 750 bp) in the cultivars with low PPO activity and a single PCR fragment (< 750 bp) in the cultivars with high PPO activity. Screening of this marker on 235 Chinese wheat micro-core collections showed that the double fragments were present in 113 genotypes and the single fragments in the remaining 122 genotypes. Statistic analysis revealed that the cultivars with the double fragments had significantly lower mean PPO activity than those with single fragments. Through sequence analysis and blast search in NCBI, we found that the cultivars with the double fragments contained the PPO-2Ab allele, while the cultivars with the single fragments contained the PPO-2Aa allele. The PPO-2Ab and PPO-2Da alleles were associated with the low grain PPO activity and the PPO-2Aa and PPO-2Db alleles associated with the high PPO activity. The genotypes carrying both PPO-2Ab and PPO-2Da showed the lowest PPO activity, while the genotypes carrying both PPO-2Aa and PPO-2Db showed the highest PPO activity. Comparison of PPO05 and STS01 with the STS markers PPO18 and PPO29 showed that the larger and small fragments of PPO05 were equivalent to the 876- and 685-bp fragments of PPO18, respectively, and that STS01 was the complementary marker of PPO29. Thus, the STS markers PPO05 and STS01 along with PPO18 and PPO29 are the efficient and reliable markers for the evaluation of PPO activity and can be used in wheat breeding programs to improve the quality of noodles and other end products.

AB The selection with co-dominant SSR markers existent on the market, accomplished in dihaploid wheat lines, offers the opportunity to rapidly stabilize the selected resistant individuals into homozygous estate. As biological material there were used 21 resistant and two sensitive dihaploid lines, All dihaploid lines tested, with field resistance to Septoria tritici leaf blotch, expressed at least once such a resistant gene. The most frequently there were encountered in the tested material the Stb 7 and Stb 8 leaf blotch resistant genes. The size of amplification products specific for SSR markers linked with Stb 7 and Stb 8 resistant genes were similar to those obtained by Adhikari et al. (2004) but the size of amplification products linked with Stb 2 resistant genes were quite different, probably due to the polymorphism that characterizes microsatellite markers at the allelic level. The Stb3, Stb 4 and Stb 6 resistant genes were totally absent. The results obtained for Stb 1 and Stb 5 were inconclusive.

AB Kansas and California wheat-growing regions differ dramatically in soils, climate, wheat cultivars, crop rotation patterns, and cultural practices, which could select for different fungal populations of Mycosphaerella graminicola. Our objective in this study was to use amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci to assess the genetic diversity of M. graminicola populations within single fields in two widely separated, and geographically isolated sites in Kansas and California. Three primer-pair combinations were used to resolve polymorphism at 177 loci in 67 and 63 isolates from Kansas and California, respectively. Genotypic variability was high, which is consistent with a genetically diverse initial inoculum. There was no evidence of genetic disequilibrium in either population, with only 4.6% of the locus pairs in Kansas, and 5.4% of the locus pairs in California in detectable disequilibrium. The migration rate calculated between the two sites was as low as 1.8 individuals per generation, and significant differences in allele frequencies were observed. Therefore, these two populations do not represent mere subsamples of a larger, randomly mating population. This is a rare report of isolation by distance occurring between two North American populations of M. graminicola, indicating that at least some of these populations may be differentiating. Although genetic isolation by distance may occur, we cannot exclude movement of new gene combinations such as fungicide resistance or virulence between these two locations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a widespread problem which reduces yield and grain nutritive value in many cereal growing regions of the world. While there is considerable genetic variation in tolerance to Zn deficiency (also known as Zn efficiency), phenotypic selection is difficult and would benefit from the development of molecular markers. A doubled haploid population derived from a cross between the Zn inefficient genotype RAC875-2 and the moderately efficient genotype Cascades was screened in three experiments to identify QTL linked to growth under low Zn and with the concentrations of Zn and iron (Fe) in leaf tissue and in the grain. Two experiments were conducted under controlled conditions while the third examined the response to Zn in the field. QTL were identified using an improved method of analysis, whole genome average interval mapping. Shoot biomass and shoot Zn and Fe concentrations showed significant negative correlations, while there were significant genetic correlations between grain Zn and Fe concentrations. Shoot biomass, tissue and grain Zn concentrations were controlled by a number of genes, many with a minor effect. Depending on the traits and the site, the QTL accounted for 12-81% of the genetic variation. Most of the QTL linked to seedling growth under Zn deficiency and to Zn and Fe concentrations were associated with height genes with greater seedling biomass associated with lower Zn and Fe concentrations. Four QTL for grain Zn concentration and a single QTL for grain Fe concentration were also identified. A cluster of adjacent QTL related to the severity of symptoms of Zn deficiency, shoot Zn concentration and kernel weight was found on chromosome 4A and a cluster of QTL associated with shoot and grain Fe concentrations and kernel weight was found on chromosome 3D. These two regions appear promising areas for further work to develop markers for enhanced growth under low Zn and for Zn and Fe uptake. Although there was no significant difference between the parents, the grain Zn concentration ranged from 29 to 43 mg kg(-1) within the population and four QTL associated with grain Zn concentration were identified. These were located on chromosomes 3D, 4B, 6B and 7A and they described 92% of the genetic variation. Each QTL had a relatively small effect on grain Zn concentration but combining the four high Zn alleles increased the grain Zn by 23%. While this illustrates the potential for pyramiding genes to improve grain Zn, breeding for increased grain Zn concentration requires identification of individual QTL with large effects, which in turn requires construction and testing of new mapping populations in the future.

AB Genetic diversity of 25 accessions of Cymbopogon aromatic grasses including eight species, two hybrids and one mutant strain were analyzed using DNA markers generated by employing 20 primer pairs derived from cDNAs containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) of rice genome. A total of 151 bands were produced ranging from 3 to 12 per primer pair. The polymorphic information content values varied from 0.143 to 0.916 with an average 0.715. Jaccard's similarity coefficient ranged from 64 to 87% among the paired accessions. The level of diversity among different taxa/accessions observed during the present study was, however, low relative to the diversity level obtained due to RAPD markers in earlier studies. The pattern of genetic diversity neither matched with the known taxonomic classification, nor did it always match with the distribution of chemical constituents of the essential oils available in these accessions. Thus, present investigation though revealed poor correlation between the molecular and chemical diversity, indicating that chemical diversity in medicinal and aromatic species is not only result of genetic variability, but it also depends on a number of other factors. Thus this study may prove useful in several ways in Cymbopogon conservation and breeding programs and in the development of perfect markers though association mapping for genes involved in controlling agronomically important traits.

TI Analysis of Intraspecies Diversity in Wheat and Barley Genomes

AB A large number of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) varieties have evolved in agricultural ecosystems since domestication. Because of the large, repetitive genomes of these Triticeae crops, sequence information is limited and molecular differences between modern varieties are poorly understood. To study intraspecies genomic diversity, we compared large genomic sequences at the Lr34 locus of the wheat varieties Chinese Spring, Renan, and Glenlea, and diploid wheat Aegilops tauschii. Additionally, we compared the barley loci Vrs1 and Rym4 of the varieties Morex, Cebada Capa, and Haruna Nijo. Molecular dating showed that the wheat D genome haplotypes diverged only a few thousand years ago, while some barley and Ae. tauschii haplotypes diverged more than 500,000 years ago. This suggests gene flow from wild barley relatives after domestication, whereas this was rare or absent in the D genome of hexaploid wheat. In some segments, the compared haplotypes were very similar to each other, but for two varieties each at the Rym4 and Lr34 loci, sequence conservation showed a breakpoint that separates a highly conserved from a less conserved segment. We interpret this as recombination breakpoints of two ancient haplotypes, indicating that the Triticeae genomes are a heterogeneous and variable mosaic of haplotype fragments. Analysis of insertions and deletions showed that large events caused by transposable element insertions, illegitimate recombination, or unequal crossing over were relatively rare. Most insertions and deletions were small and caused by template slippage in short homopolymers of only a few base pairs in size. Such frequent polymorphisms could be exploited for future molecular marker development.

AB Plant disease resistance governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) is predicted to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and long lasting. Use of these QTL to improve crop species, however, is hindered because the genes contributing to the trait are not known. Five disease resistance QTL that colocalized with defense response genes were accumulated by marker-aided selection to develop blast-resistant varieties. One advanced backcross line carrying the major-effect QTL on chromosome (chr) 8, which included a cluster of 12 germin-like protein (OsGLP) gene members, exhibited resistance to rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease over 14 cropping seasons. To determine if OsGLP members contribute to resistance and if the resistance was broad spectrum, a highly conserved portion of the OsGLP coding region was used as an RNA interference trigger to silence a few to all expressed chr 8 OsGLP family members. Challenge with two different fungal pathogens (causal agents of rice blast and sheath blight diseases) revealed that as more chr 8 OsGLP genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. Of the 12 chr 8 OsGLPs, one clustered subfamily (OsGER4) contributed most to resistance. The similarities of sequence, gene organization, and roles in disease resistance of GLP family members in rice and other cereals, including barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), suggest that resistance contributed by the chr 8 OsGLP is a broad-spectrum, basal mechanism conserved among the Gramineae. Natural selection may have preserved a whole gene family to provide a stepwise, flexible defense response to pathogen invasion.

AB The first confirmed mechanism for aluminum (Al) resistance in plants is encoded by the wheat (Triticum aestivum) gene, TaALMT1, on chromosome 4DL. TaALMT1 controls the Al-activated efflux of malate from roots, and this mechanism is widespread among Al-resistant genotypes of diverse genetic origins. This study describes a second mechanism for Al resistance in wheat that relies on citrate efflux. Citrate efflux occurred constitutively from the roots of Brazilian cultivars Carazinho, Maringa, Toropi, and Trintecinco. Examination of two populations segregating for this trait showed that citrate efflux was controlled by a single locus. Whole-genome linkage mapping using an F 2 population derived from a cross between Carazinho (citrate efflux) and the cultivar EGA-Burke (no citrate efflux) identified a major locus on chromosome 4BL, Xce(c), which accounts for more than 50% of the phenotypic variation in citrate efflux. Mendelizing the quantitative variation in citrate efflux into qualitative data, the Xce(c) locus was mapped within 6.3 cM of the microsatellite marker Xgwm495 locus. This linkage was validated in a second population of F(2:3) families derived from a cross between Carazinho and the cultivar Egret (no citrate efflux). We show that expression of an expressed sequence tag, belonging to the multidrug and toxin efflux (MATE) gene family, correlates with the citrate efflux phenotype. This study provides genetic and physiological evidence that citrate efflux is a second mechanism for Al resistance in wheat.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most destructive diseases of common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). To determine inheritance of stripe rust resistance and map the resistance gene(s) in wheat variety C591, F(1), F(2), and F(3) progenies derived from the Taichung 29 X C591 cross were inoculated with Chinese PST race CY32 in the greenhouse. Genetic analysis identified a single dominant gene, temporarily designated YrC591. A total of 178 SSR and 130 AFLP markers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. From the bulk segregant analysis, seven polymorphic SSR and two AFLP markers were selected for genotyping the F2 population. SSR marker Xcfa2040-7B, and SCAR marker SC-P35M48 derived from AFLP marker P35M48(373) were identified to be closely linked to the resistance gene with genetic distances of 8.0 and 11.7 cM, respectively. The SSR markers mapped the resistance gene on chromosome arm 7BL. In the seedling test with five PST races, the reaction patterns of C591 were different from wheat cultivars or lines carrying Yr2 or Yr6 that also are found on chromosome 7B. The results indicate that YrC591 is probably a novel stripe rust resistance gene.

AB Twenty eight populations of Podophyllum hexandrum Royle were selected to study genetic relationship using RAPID and ISSR markers from north-western Himalayas, Himachal Pradesh, India. Nineteen RAPID primers and I I ISSR primers amplified a total of 131 and 68 scorable bands, of which 92.37% and 83.82%. respectively, were polymorphic. The mean coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst) was 0.6933 and 0.6296. indicating that Nei's gene diversity of 33.77% and 29.44% reside in all the populations. Estimated value of gene flow for RAPID (Nm = 0.11059), for ISSR (Nm = 0.1470) individually, and the combination of RAPD+ISSR (Nm = 0.1211) markers indicated that there was limited gene flow among the populations. The dendrogram obtained from UPGMA analysis revealed grouping of populations with respect to their forest division, except with Kullu forest division. The existence variation among 28 populations based on percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was proved to be coupled with geographical altitude (r = 0.474). The genetic similarity matrices generated by ISSR and RAPID markers were highly correlated (r = 0.721 at P = 0.001), showed similar estimation between the 2 systems. Both markers were equally useful in providing some understanding about the genetic relationship of different populations in Podophyllum L.

AB Both resistance genes Lr19 and Lr24 originate from Agropyron elongatum. The gene Lr24 is derived from two different translocations: 1BS/3Ag (`Amigo') or 3DS/3Ag (`Agent'). The use of molecular markers makes selection easier during the breeding process as well as in the selection of the parents. In this study, two markers were used to identify the gene Lr19 (GbF/R-130, SCS265(512)) and four different markers (J9/1-2(310), SC-H5(700), SCS1302(613) and SCS1326(607)) were available to search for the gene Lr24. The GbF/(R130) marker for gene Lr19 worked well, but the SCAR marker SCS265(512) proved to be easier to use in MAS. SCAR markers SCS1302(613) and SCS1326(607) proved to be highly reliable and effective for gene Lr24 not only in Agent-derived sources but also in `Amigo' derivatives. The STS marker J9/1-2(310) and the SCAR marker SC-H5(700) required several modifications and were effective only in `Agent' offsprings.

AB The common wheat line, YW243, developed in our research group, was tested for the resistances of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), powdery mildew (Pm) and stripe rust in field, and was analyzed by molecular markers for convenient trace of the resistant genes in breeding. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) assay further demonstrated that YW243 was a homozygous multiple translocation line of Triticum aestivum, Thinopyrum intermedium and Secale cereale (T7DS(.)7DL-7XL & 1BL(.)1RS). The disease resistance test and marker analysis showed that YW243 carried seven resistance genes to the three diseases, including Bdv2 to BYDV on 7DL-7XL, Pm4 to powdery mildew on 2AL, Yr2, Yr9, Sr 31 and Lr26 and a new Yr to stripe rust on 7B, 1BL, 1RS and 2BL. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers Xpsr687 and Xwg380, sequence tagged site (STS) marker STS1700, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Xgwmc364 and Xgwm582, SSR markers Xgwm388 and Xgwm501 can be used as diagnostic tools to track Bdv2, Pm4, Yr2, Yr9 and Yr in YW243, respectively; and two amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers M54E63-(700) and M54E64-(699) can also be used to select Yr in YW243.

AB Ninety percent of wheat varieties grown worldwide have a semi-dwarf phenotype controlled by three major genes Rht-B1 (formerly Rht1), Rht-D1 (formerly Rht2) and Rht8. The objective of this study was to determine their frequency in modern wheat varieties grown in Germany. Ninety-five winter wheat varieties that were registered in Germany in 2004 were screened with PCR-based markers for Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 and with the microsatellite WMS261 for Rht8. The Rht8 allele for plant height reduction was not found in any of the varieties, which confirms previous studies. Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b alleles were present in 44% of the screened varieties, but only 6% contained Rht-B1b, which predominates in northern Europe. Rht-D1b was found in 38% of the varieties, which were planted on 34% of the total area of wheat in Germany. Wheat varieties with Rht-D1b were shorter and higher yielding than wheat varieties without this allele, but more susceptible to Fusarium head blight, which could limit their productivity.

AB Biotic and abiotic stresses are responsible for much of the variation in wheat production worldwide. The plant, in responding to stress events, increases the endogenous synthesis of hormones such as Abscisic Acid, Ethylene, Jasmonic Acid and Salicylic Acid. This paper was aimed at determining the location of plant-defence genes triggered by treatment with stress-induced hormones in a set of recombinant doubled haploid substitution lines involving variation for a single chromosome, 6A, previously shown to carry genes for aphid resistance. Eighty-three doubled haploid recombinant substitution (DHR) lines for chromosome 6A derived from the F(1) of "Chinese Spring" (CS) "Chinese Spring (Synthetic 6A)" (S6A) substitution line, were used as a mapping population. Plants of every genotype at the fully expanded 3rd leaf stage were subjected to four hormone treatments: ethylene (E), jasmonic acid (J), salicylic acid (S) and abscisic acid (A), together with an untreated control. The changes in a range of phenotypic traits were measured, aerial fresh weight (AFWC), aerial dry weight (ADWC), root fresh weight (RFWC), root dry weight (RDWC), foliar area (FAC). These were recorded twice: at the onset of the experiment before spraying with hormones and 72 h later. Nine QTLs were detected which were significantly associated with 6A molecular markers, explaining the variation for ADWC, RDWC and FAC. Most of the QTLs were associated with the interval between loci Xgwm459 and Xgwm334a, located in the telomeric region of the short arm of 6A. The dissection of complex agronomic traits such as tolerance to stress and QTLs related to exogenous hormone treatments could be used in marker-assisted selection for breeding wheat with tolerance to stresses.

AB Grain hardness plays an important role in determining both milling performance and quality of the end-use products produced from common or bread wheat. The objective of this study was to characterize allelic variations at the Pina and Pinb loci in Xinjiang wheat germplasm for further understanding the mechanisms involved in endosperm texture formation, and the status of grain texture in Chinese bread wheat. A total of 291 wheat cultivars, including 56 landraces, and 95 introduced and 140 locally improved cultivars, grown in Xinjiang, were used for SKCS measurement and molecular characterization. Among the harvested grain samples, 185 (63.6%), 40 (13.7%), and 66 (22.7%) were classified as hard, mixed and soft, respectively. Eight different genotypes for the Pina and Pinb loci were identified, including seven previously reported genotypes, viz., Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1a, Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1b, Pina-D1b/Pinb-D1a, Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1p, Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1q, Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1aa, Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1ab, and a novel Pinb allele, Pinb-D1ac. This new allele, detected in Kashibaipi (local landrace) and Red Star (from Russia) has a double mutation at the 257th (G to A substitution) and 382nd (C to T substitution) nucleotide positions of the coding region. Pina-D1b, Pinb-D1b, and Pinb-D1p were the most common alleles in Xinjiang wheat germplasm, with frequencies of 14.3%, 38.1% and 28.6% in hard textured landraces, 25.5%, 56.9% and 11.8% in hard introduced cultivars, and 24.8%, 47.8% and 26.5% in hard locally improved cultivars, respectively. The restriction enzymes ApaI, SapI, BstXI and SfaNI were used to identify Pinb-D1ab or Pinb-D1ac, Pinb-D1b, Pinb-D1e and Pinb-Dg, respectively, by digesting PCR products of the Pinb gene. The unique grain hardness distribution in Xinjiang bread wheat, as well as the CAPs markers for identification of the Pinb alleles provided useful information for breeding wheat cultivars with optimum grain textures.

AB The single chromosome substitution lines of chromosome 3B of the Czech alternative wheat variety Ceska Presivka (CP 3B) into two spring varieties Zlatka and Sandra, revealed clear differences in flowering time compared to the recipient varieties. To map this gene(s), recombinant substitution lines for chromosome 3B were produced from crosses of the substitution lines with their recipient parents and genetic maps developed using SSR markers. Two populations were mapped, Sandra//Sandra 3B/Sandra (CP 3B) and Zlatka//Zlatka/Zlatka (CP 3B). Combining the genotype data with phenotype data on flowering time in five independent experiments under natural long day or controlled short day conditions revealed a single flowering time QTL. This gene had an additive effect of 1-6 days, depending on environment and genetic background, and was mapped in both populations to a position in the region of marker Xbarc164 near the centromere on the long arm of 3B. Comparisons of the genetic maps with other 3B maps developed by the authors indicated that the QTL may be homologous to a QTL segregating in UK germplasm.

AB A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross Arina/Forno was field tested for 2 years against Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici under artificially created epidemic conditions. Both parents showed intermediate adult plant stem rust responses and the RIL population showed continuous variation for this trait. Composite interval mapping identified genomic regions controlling low stem rust response on chromosomes 5B and 7D consistently across all experiments. These genomic regions were named QSr.Sun-5BL and QSr.Sun-7DS and explained on an average 12% and 26% of the phenotypic variation in adult plant stem rust response, respectively. QSr.Sun-5BL mapped close to Xglk0354 and was contributed by Arina. The Lr34-linked markers csLV34 and swm10 were closely associated with QSr.Sun-7DS suggesting the involvement of Lr34 in controlling adult plant stem rust response of cultivar Forno. Additional minor and inconsistent QTLs explaining variation in adult plant stem rust response were identified on chromosome arms 1AS and 7BL. The QTL located on chromosome 7BL corresponded to the stem rust resistance gene Sr17 carried by cultivar Forno. A seedling stem rust resistance gene carried by Arina, SrAn1, was ineffective under field conditions and was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 2A. Genotypes carrying combinations of QSr.Sun-5BL and QSr.Sun-7DS based on positive alleles of the respective closest marker loci Xglk0354 and XcsLV34 or Xswm10 exhibited a lower response than either parent indicating an additive effect of these genes. Transfer of these genes into cultivars carrying Sr2 would provide a more effective and durable resistance against the stem rust pathogen. Markers csLV34 and/or swm10 could be used in marker assisted selection of QSr.Sun-7DS in breeding programs.

AB The diploid goatgrass Aegilops tauschii is considered the D-genome donor of bread wheat and has probably a centre of diversity in north of Iran. In order to measure the genetic diversity of and the relationships among different populations, varieties and subspecies belonging to Ae. tauschii in Iran, DNA was extracted from 48 accessions of Ae. tauschii collected across the geographic range of the species in the Country and the genetic diversity was assessed using AFLPs based on eight PstI/MseI +3 primer pairs resulted in 277 bands, 198 of which were polymorphic. High level polymorphism was detected, with an average of polymorphism rate of 0.715; relatively low genetic similarity (0.455) between accessions and significant difference between the lowest (0.179) and the highest genetic similarity (0.817). The Iranian Ae. tauschii populations showed high level of genetic diversity. The populations studied were divided into two groups: one group was mainly representing Northern populations collected from Southern Caspian Sea shore and the other group was mainly representing Northeast and Northwest populations. Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that Ae. tauschii possesses two separate gene-pools in Iran: Northern and Northeastern-Northwestern. Considering the needs for introducing new characteristics and alleles for wheat improvement purposes, Ae. tauschii Iranian gene-pool is assumed to be of high importance for more investigation in the future.

AB Gene pyramiding has been successfully practiced in plant breeding for developing new breeds or lines in which favorable genes from several different lines were integrated. But it has not been used in animal breeding, and some theoretical investigation and simulation analysis with respect to its strategies, feasibility and efficiency are needed before it can be implemented in animals. In this study, we used four different pure lines of Drosophila melanogaster, each of which is homozygous at a specific mutant gene with a visible effect on phenotype, to simulate the gene pyramiding process and analyze the duration and population size required in different pyramiding strategies. We finally got the ideal individuals, which are homozygous at the four target genes simultaneously. This study demonstrates that gene pyramiding is feasible in animal breeding and the interaction between genes may affect the final results.

AB Stripe rust and powdery mildew, Caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively, ire severe diseases in wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. In our study, differential amplification of a 201-bp cDNA fragment was obtained in a cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis between near-isogenic lines Yr10NIL and Avocet S, inoculated with P.striiformis f. sp. tritici race CYR29. A full-length cDNA (1,357 bp) of a homeobox-like gene, TaHLRG (GenBank accession no. EU385606), was obtained in common wheat based oil the sequence of GenBank accession AW448633 with high similarity to the above fragment, The genomic DNA sequence (2,396 bp) of TaHLRG contains three exons and two introns. TAHLRG appeared to be a novel homeobox-like gene, encoding a protein with a predicted 66-amino-acid homeobox domain. It was involved in race-specific responses to Stripe rust ill real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses with Yr9NIL., Yr10NIL, and Avocet S. It was also associated with adult-plant resistance to stripe rust and powdery mildew based on the field trials of doubled haploid lines derived from the cross Bainong 64/Jingshuang 16 and two F(2:3) populations from the crosses Lumai 21/Jingshuang 16 and Strampelli/Huixianhong. A functional marker, THR1 was developed based on the sequence of TaHLRG and located on chromosome 6A using a set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines.

AB Site-specific recombination systems are becoming an important tool for the genetic modification of crop plants. Here we report the functional expression of the Streptomyces phage-derived phiC31 recombinase (integrase) in wheat. T-DNA constructs containing a phiC31 integrase transgene were stably transformed into wheat plants via particle gun bombardment. A plant-virus-based assay system was used to monitor the site-specific recombination activity of the recombinant integrase protein in vivo. We established several independent doubled haploid (DH) inbred lines that constitutively express an active integrase enzyme without any apparent detrimental effects on plant growth and development. The potential of phiC31 integrase expression in crop plants related to transgene control technologies or hybrid breeding systems is discussed.

AB Traits related to plant development and lodging resistance in 292 rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were investigated by dissecting QTLs affecting four basal internodal traits of the main stem, lengths of five elongated internodes contributing to plant height (PH), and three traits related to heading date (HD). The RILs showed tremendous transgressive segregation for all the traits and a total of 41 genomic regions associated with one or more measured traits were detected. These included 17 QTL regions affecting one or more basal internodal traits, 21 associated with one or more PH and related traits, and 12 for HD and/or its component traits. Of the 21 genomic regions associated with PH traits, two QTL clusters on chromosomes 6 and 10 were expressed consecutively during rice development, and the remaining 19 QTLs appeared to be expressed at one or more specific developmental stages, revealing an important aspect of the relationship between PH and its component traits. The transition from the vegetative growth to the reproductive stage in rice appeared to have a large effect on QTL expression, reflected by the different behaviors of most QTLs affecting panicle length from other PH QTLs. The 17QTL regions associated with one or more basal internodal traits plus nine QTLs affecting two lower elongated internodes were expected to contribute to lodging resistance (LR) of rice. The large allelic differences at these QTLs between japonica and indica parents imply that improved LR in rice can be readily achieved by combining large numbers of QTL alleles affecting stem length, strength, and thickness in indica/japonica crosses. Specific expression patterns of the identified QTLs; and their contributions to morphological traits related to plant development and LR are expected to provide important information for marker-assisted improvement of the target traits in rice and cloning genes underlying QTL of interest.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint for wheat production in acidic soils. Wheat producers now routinely use Al-resistant cultivars as one cost-effective means to reduce risks associated with acidic soils. To date, diverse Al-resistant materials have been identified, but their genetic relationship has not been well characterized. A total of 57 wheat accessions, including the majority of the parents of Al-resistant accessions we identified in a previous study, were evaluated for Al resistance and analyzed with 49 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 4 markers for Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1). Pedigree and principle coordinate analysis (PCA) both separated Al-resistant accessions into four groups labeled according to common ancestry or geographical origin: US-Fultz, Polyssu, Mexican and Chinese. Al resistance in the four groups may have three independent origins given their distinct geographic origins and gene pools. Fultz originated in the USA as a major ancestor to soft red winter wheat, Polyssu originated in Brazil as a major source of Al resistance used in most genetic studies worldwide, and the Chinese group originated in China. Based on ALMT1 marker haplotypes, the Al resistance in the Polyssu and Mexico groups was likely derived from Polyssu, while most Al-resistant cultivars developed in the USA most likely inherited most of Al resistance from Fultz. Fultz was released about 50 years earlier than Polyssu. Norin 10 likely played a pivotal role in passing Al-resistant gene(s) from Fultz to better adapted, semi-dwarf wheat cultivars developed in the USA. Further characterization of Al resistance in the three different sources could reveal multiple Al-resistant mechanisms in wheat.

AB End-use quality is one of the priorities of modern wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding. Even though quality is a complex trait, high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins play a major role in determining the bread making quality of wheat. DNA markers developed from the sequences of HMW glutenin genes were reported in several previous studies to facilitate marker-assisted selection (MAS). However, most of the previously available markers are dominant and amplify large DNA fragments, and thus are not ideal for high throughput genotyping using modern equipment. The objective of this study was to develop and validate co-dominant markers suitable for high throughput MAS for HMW glutenin subunits encoded at the Glu-A1 and Glu-D1 loci. Indels were identified by sequence alignment of allelic HMW glutenin genes, and were targeted to develop locus-specific co-dominant markers. Marker UMN19 was developed by targeting an 18-bp deletion in the coding sequence of subunit Ax2* of Glu-A1. A single DNA fragment was amplified by marker UMN19, and was placed onto chromosome 1AL. Sixteen wheat cultivars with known HMW glutenin subunits were used to validate marker UMN19. The cultivars with subunit Ax2* amplified the 362-bp fragment as expected, and a 344-bp fragment was observed for cultivars with subunit Ax1 or the Ax-null allele. Two co-dominant markers, UMN25 and UMN26, were developed for Glu-D1 by targeting the fragment size polymorphic sites between subunits Dx2 and Dx5, and between Dy10 and Dy12, respectively. The 16 wheat cultivars with known HMW glutenin subunit composition were genotyped with markers UMN25 and UMN26, and the genotypes perfectly matched their subunit types. Using an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer, four F(2) populations segregating for the Glu-A1 or Glu-D1 locus were successfully genotyped with primers UMN19, UMN25 and UMN26 labeled with fluorescent dyes.

AB Hybridisation between wheat and Aegilops geniculata was quantified in a 4-year crossing experiment in the glasshouse, using three wheat cultivars as pollen donors and herbicide resistance as a phenotypic marker. Hybridisation rates ranged from 5% to 74%. Most of the hybrids were self-sterile. However, seven F(2) seeds were obtained from 165 A. geniculata-wheat hybrids. Hybrid seeds were found in all backcross (BC(1)) combinations at average rates of 4.2% (0-26.3%) and 5.88% (0-34%) under glasshouse and field experiments, respectively, with significant differences among years and cultivars. Wheat cultivars, F(1) and BC(1) plants, were resistant to herbicides while A. geniculata plants were susceptible. In the subsequent generations, although few plants were available, the BC(1)F(1) had a certain degree of fertility and the fertility increased in the F(2) plants, with one plant that reached 66.7%. The commercial growing of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant wheat is expected to have the potential for the inserted gene to escape from the crop and become incorporated in a closely related wild species, conferring a competitive advantage to these conferring weeds. Determining the frequency of crop-wild transgene flow and the fertility of the formed hybrids is a necessity for risk assessment. Data presented here provide new knowledge on the potential A. geniculata-wheat herbicide resistance transfer.

AB Gibberella zeae is one of the most devastating pathogens of barley and wheat in the United States. The fungus also infects noncereal crops, such as potatoes and sugar beets, and the genetic relationships among barley, wheat, potato, and sugar beet isolates indicate high levels of similarity. However, little is known about the toxigenic potential of G. zeae isolates from potatoes and sugar beets. A total of 336 isolates of G. zeae from barley, wheat, potatoes, and sugar beets were collected and analyzed by TRI (trichothecene biosynthesis gene)-based PCR assays. To verify the TRI-based PCR detection of genetic markers by chemical analysis, 45 representative isolates were grown in rice cultures for 28 days and 15 trichothecenes and 2 zearalenone (ZEA) analogs were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. TRI-based PCR assays revealed that all isolates had the deoxynivalenol (DON) marker. The frequencies of isolates with the 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON) marker were higher than those of isolates with the 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON) marker among isolates from all four crops. Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant wheat cultivars had little or no influence on the diversity of isolates associated with the 3-ADON and 15-ADON markers. However, the frequency of isolates with the 3-ADON marker among isolates from the Langdon, ND, sampling site was higher than those among isolates from the Carrington and Minot, ND, sites. In chemical analyses, DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, b-ZEA, and ZEA were detected. All isolates produced DON (1 to 782 mu g/g) and ZEA (1 to 623 mu g/g). These findings may be useful for monitoring mycotoxin contamination and for formulating FHB management strategies for these crops.

AB Stripe rust is an important wheat disease worldwide and resistance to stripe rust is often not controlled by race-specific resistance genes. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting quantitative resistance to stripe rust, 329 F(2:3) families from a cross between highly resistant winter hype cv. MV17 and highly susceptible spring type local cv Bolani were used. The population was evaluated for adult plant resistance to pathotype 134E134A(+) of Puccinia striiformis, in the field condition and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated Fifty six polymorphic SSR markers between parental genotypes were screened in the population and linkage map was constructed using these markers. Based on composite interval mapping (CIM) 14 regions on nine (4A, 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 2D and 7D) out of the 21 wheat chromosomes were significantly associated with AUDPC. The effect of QTLs varied from 0.01 to 8.00% giving an aggregate effect of 34.3% for AUDPC. Leaf tip necrosis (LTN) was also recorded as presence and absence and the phenotype was used as a dominant Mendelian morphologic marker Linkage analysis revealed association between LTN and Xbarc352 SSR marker on chromosome 7D.

AB Imidazolinone-resistant (IR) spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was released commercially in Canada in 2004, providing growers with a new opportunity to selectively control a broad range of weeds in wheat, including volunteer cereals and annual grasses. Imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides inhibit acetolactate synthase in susceptible (S) plants, but IR wheat plants have an altered target site that confers resistance to IMI herbicides. The IR trait has served as a phenotypic marker in a number of gene flow studies, but the response of IR F(1) wheat hybrids to various doses of imazamox has not been adequately characterized. Therefore, a greenhouse study was initiated to assess the whole-plant response of several spring wheat genotypes with different parental backgrounds to increasing doses of imazamox. No differences in biomass accumulation prior to imazamox application were detected among genotypes. Biomass accumulation after foliar treatment with imazamox was similar within all groups of genotypes, with no significant differences detected within F(1) or S genotype groups. The resistance factor (GR(50) ratio) of the single IR genotype tested in the study was six-fold greater than the mean of the F, genotypes, which was itself six-fold greater than that of the S genotypes examined. Differential mortality was observed between some S genotypes at 3.9 g a.i. ha(-1), but no differences between genotypes were observed at any other dose. The results of this study indicate that for the spring wheat genotypes assessed, parental background and market class do not affect spring wheat tolerance to imazamox. Furthermore, results indicate that the IR trait in spring wheat should provide a satisfactory marker for pollen-mediated gene flow studies.

AB Constructing high-degree gene-pyramided lines has important practical implications; such lines could be used for multiple purposes, for example, as a high-powered breeding stock line, a material line for characterizing multigene interactions, or a market variety as it stands. Effectiveness of two typical marker-based schemes for constructing such lines, named AF (gene assemblage first) and BF (backcross first), is discussed. In AF, target genes of all donor parents are assembled onto the genome of a plant first, followed by backcross generations for the recovery of recipient parent genome. In BF, backcross is per-formed first separately for each donor, followed by generations of crossing for the assemblage of target genes. Our stochastic calculations show that BF is superior to AF when molecular selection is used for both target genes and background markers; with the same number of generations (time) and cost of genotyping, BF produces a much higher recovery of recurrent parent genome than AF The superiority of BF weakens somewhat when target genes are selected by phenotype; AF is superior when assembling three or more unlinked target genes, or could be a choice of the breeder when assembling three or more linked genes. Otherwise, BF is superior. To minimize cost, genotyping and selection for background markers should be performed stepwise in each generation, that is, in three or four stages starting from markers closely linked with target genes to unlinked ones.

AB Leymus cinereus and L. triticoides are large caespitose and rhizomatous perennial grasses, respectively. Previous studies detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling rhizome spreading near the viviparous1 (vp1) gene markers on linkage groups LG3a and LG3b in two families, TTC1 and TTC2, derived from Leymus triticoides x Leymus cinereus hybrids. The wheat tiller inhibition gene (tin3) is located on Triticum monococcum chromosome 3 A(m)L near vp1. Triticeae group 3 is reportedly collinear with rice chromosome 1, which also contains the maize barren stalk1 and rice lax branching orthogene near vp1. However, previous studies lacked cross-species markers for comparative mapping and showed possible rearrangements of Leymus group 3 in wheat-Leymus racemosus chromosome addition lines. Here, we developed expressed sequence tag (EST) markers from Leymus tiller and rhizomes and mapped sequences aligned to rice chromosome 1. Thirty-eight of 44 informative markers detected loci on Leymus LG3a and LG3b that were collinear with homoeologous sequences on rice chromosome 1 and syntenous in homoeologous group 3 wheat-Leymus and wheat-Thinopyrum addition lines. A SCARECROW-like GRAS-family transcription factor candidate gene was identified in the Leymus EST library, which aligns to the Leymus chromosome group 3 growth habit QTL and a 324-kb rice chromosome 1 region thought to contain the wheat tin3 gene.

AB We used amplified-fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to evaluate genetic variation in a set of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landraces and improved materials. Landraces collected from different geographic and agro-ecological zones in Pakistan in 1987, 1989 and 1991 were separated into two groups based on their geographic origins: northern (Himalaya) and south-western (Balochistan) Pakistan. Six AFLP primer combinations detected 453 AFLP markers in the 43 landrace accessions and four high-yield varieties (HYVs). Of these, 225 (49.67%) were rare (shared with < 5% of all accessions). Among these rare alleles, 23 (10.22%) were common in the Himalaya (shared with > 10% of accessions collected there) but were not found in Balochistan. We conclude that there is a higher probability of collecting rare alleles at overall, but which are in contrast locally common ones in the Himalayan region. Gene diversity was 0.17 in the Himalayan group and 0.15 in the Balochistan group. Considerable genetic variability was found in both groups. Accessions from different agro-ecological zones were indistinguishable by cluster analysis, indicating intensive seed trading within the country. Cluster analysis indicated that the landraces and the HYVs are genetically distinct; suggesting that genetic erosion of wheat landraces has been unlikely taken in place. This study provides an example of how analysis of existing materials and data, can serve as a basis for future collection planning and conservation policies.

AB Wild species in the Triticeae tribe are very valuable resources for agronomic improvement in cereal crop species. Intergeneric hybrids were produced between several barley cultivars and perennial species in the genera Elymus, Thinopyrum, and Pseudoroegneria. Caryopsis formation and subsequent plantlet regeneration from embryo culture were variable depending on the hybrid combinations. Chromosome numbers and hybrid identity were confirmed by GISH analysis on the somatic cells of the hybrids. While the hybrids showed very robust vegetative growth and exceeded the parental spikes in size, their floral morphologies resembled that of the wild species. Meiotic chromosome analysis revealed that the bivalent formation frequency per cell ranged from 0.06 in Hordeum vulgare 'Betzes' x Elymus curvatus to 3.0 in Elymus humidus x H. vulgare 'Manley'. By GISH analysis on the meiocytes of the hybrid E. humidus x 'Manley', the frequency of autosyndetic bivalents exceeded the allosyndetic bivalent formation, which gave an insight into the genome constitution of E. humidus as an autoallohexploid species. Regardless of the low allosyndetic chromosome pairing between barley and E. humidus, this combination may be useful for further input, since E. humidus is known to carry many valuable genes for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiormis Westend f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Stripe rust resistance genes Yr27, Yr31. YrSp, YrV23, and YrCN19 on chromosome 2BS confer resistance to some or all Chinese P. striiormis f. sp. tritici races CYR31, CYR32, SY11-4, and SY11-14 in the greenhouse. To screen microsatellite (SSR) markers linked with YrCN19, F(1), F(2), and F(3) populations derived from cross Ch377/CN19 were screened with race CYR32 and 35 SSR primer pairs. Linkage analysis indicated that the single dominant gene YrCN19 in cultivar CN19 was linked with SSR markers Xgwm410, Xgwm374, Xwmc477, and Xgwm382 on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 0.3, 7.9, 12.3, and 21.2 cM, respectively. Crosses of CN19 with wheat lines carrying other genes on chromosome 2B showed that all were located at different loci. YrCN19 is thus different from the other reported Yr genes in chromosomal location and resistance response and was therefore named Yr41. Prospects and strategies of using Yr41 and other Yr genes in wheat improvement for stripe rust resistance are discussed.

AB In order to transfer useful genes of Hordeum californicum into common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the T. aestivum c.v. Chinese Spring (CS)-H. californicum amphiploid was crossed to CS, and its backcrossing and self-fertilized progenies were analyzed by morphological observation, cytological, biochemical and molecular marker techniques. Alien addition lines with two H. californicum chromosomes were identified and their genetic constitution was characterized. STS-PCR analysis using chromosome 213 specific markers indicated that chromosome H3 of H. californicum belongs to homoeologous group 2, and was thus designated 2H. SDS-PAGE showed that chromosome H2 of H. californicum belongs to homoeologous group 5, and was designated 5H. The CS-H. californicum amphiploid and the chromosome addition lines (DA2H and MA5H) identified were evaluated for powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. triticii) resistance in field. The preliminary results indicated that the amphiploid showed higher powdery mildew resistance than CS. However, chromosome addition lines DA2H and MA5H were highly susceptible to powdery mildew, indicating that major powdery mildew resistant genes of H. californicum should be located on chromosomes other than 2H and 5H.

AB A complex of Fusarium species causes a wide range of diseases in a diversity of host plants worldwide. In cereals Fusarium head blight is one of the most devastating diseases. Besides yield loss, infection of the seeds by Fusarium spp. results in the accumulation of various mycotoxins in food. In small-grain cereals, E poae and F sporotrichioides are the main pathogens with such a toxigenic profile. In this study, a highly sensitive duplex PCR assay based on multi-copy rDNA sequences was developed for the differential detection of F poae and F sporotrichioides. The assay's specificity was demonstrated on a wide range of Fusarium species from different parts of the world and from different hosts or substrates. When compared with tests based on single-copy sets of primers on symptomless wheat seed samples, our assay proved to have the highest sensitivity. The use of a marker developed on symptomless wheat seed samples originating from northern Poland showed that all samples were positive for the presence of F poae.

AB The origin, horticultural race and genetic relationship among Ghanaian avocado (Persea americana Mill.) seedlings were studied. A population of 172 avocado samples, selected from farmers' fields and backyards, Were genotyped using 12 simple sequence repeat markers. Representatives of the three horticultural races served as outliers in this study. An average 4.42 alleles per locus were elucidated across all populations. The average expected heterozygosity, H, (0.51), was 41.7% greater than the observed heterozygosity, R. (0.36), depicting heterozygote deficiency and a high level of homogeneity or inbreeding within the entire Ghanaian population. The genetic distances between the Ghanaian subpopulation pairs was low (0.00 to 0.07), further supporting a high level of homogeneity and suggesting either very few founder parents or a high proportion of founders with very little genetic variability. The phylogenetic tree generated reaffirmed the high genetic similarity among the Ghanaian seedlings with only 8.7% clustering separately. The Ghanaian population also was found to be genetically more closely related to the West Indian representatives but distinct from the Mexican and the Guatemalan accessions, proposing that either most of the founders may have been of the West Indian race or founders of the other races may not have survived the harsh tropical conditions of Ghana. It is suggested that enlarging Ghana's avocado gene pool by introducing various elite cultivars Will improve the avocado industry in this country.

AB The gene Yr26 confers resistance to all races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), the casual pathogen of wheat stripe rust in China. Here, we report development of a molecular marker closely linked to Yr26 using a resistance gene-analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique. A total of 787 F(2) plants and 165 F(3) lines derived from the cross Chuanmai 42/Taichung 29 were used for linkage analysis. Eighteen near-isogenic lines (NILs) and 18 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines with different genes for stripe rust resistance were employed for the validation of STS markers. A total of 1,711 RGAP primer combinations were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. Five polymorphic RGAP markers were used for genotyping all F(2) plants. Linkage analysis showed that the five RGAP markers were closely linked to Yr26 with genetic distances ranging from 0.5 to 2.9 cM. These markers were then converted into STS markers, one, CYS-5, of which was located 0.5 cM to Yr26 and was closely associated with the resistance gene when validated over 18 NILs and 18 Chinese wheat cultivars and lines. The results indicated that CYS-5 can be used in marker-assisted selection targeted at pyramiding Yr26 and other genes for stripe rust resistance.

AB In order to understand the genetic mechanism of heterosis that has been observed in hybrids between Brassica napus and partial new-type B. napus which had exotic genome components from relative species, this study focused on the difference in gene expression patterns among partial new-typed B. napus lines, B. napus cultivars and their hybrids using the cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism technique (cDNA-AFLP) technique. First, three partial new-type B. napus lines were compared with their original parents. One new line contained the exotic genomic components from B. rapa, and the other two new lines were obtained by the introgression of genomic components from B. rapa and B. carinata. The experimental results showed that the introgression of A(r) and C(c) genome components from B. rapa and B. carinata led to considerable differences in the gene expression profiles of the partial new-type lines when compared with their parents. Secondly, the gene expression profiles of nine cross-combinations between three partial new-type lines and three B. napus cultivars were compared. Twenty transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) associated with intersubgenomic heterosis were randomly selected and converted into PCR-based molecular markers. Some of them were mapped in the confidence intervals of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and yield-related traits in three segregative populations of B. napus. These results suggested that a proportion of the heterosis-associated TDFs were really responsible for fluctuating seed yield in rapeseed.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most widespread diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. With the objective of identifying and mapping new genes for resistance to leaf rust, F(1), F(2) plants and F(3) lines from a cross between resistant line Zhou 8425B and susceptible line Chinese Spring were inoculated with Chinese P. triticina races THTT and MBHP in the greenhouse. A total of 793 pairs of SSR primers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. Seven polymorphic chromosome 1B markers were used for genotyping the F(2) and F(3) populations. Zhou 8425B carried a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated LrZH84, linked to SSR markers gwm582 and barc8 with genetic distances of 3.9 and 5.2 cM, respectively. The Xbarc8 allele co-segregated with Lr26 in the F(3) population. The Xgwm582 allele associated with LrZH84 was identified as a leaf rust resistance gene and shown to be present in the Predgornaia 2 parent of Zhou 8425B. The seedling reaction pattern of LrZH84 was different from those of lines with Lr26, Lr33, Lr44 and Lr46, all of which are located in chromosome 1B. It was concluded that LrZH84 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance was identified in the alien species Leymus racemosus, and wheat-Leymus introgression lines with FHB resistance were reported previously. Detailed molecular cytogenetic analysis of alien introgressions T01, T09, and T14 and the mapping of Fhb3, a new gene for FHB resistance, are reported here. The introgression line T09 had an unknown wheat-Leymus translocation chromosome. A total of 36 RFLP markers selected from the seven homoeologous groups of wheat were used to characterize T09 and determine the homoeologous relationship of the introgressed Leymus chromosome with wheat. Only short arm markers for group 7 detected Leymus-specific fragments in T09, whereas 7AS-specific RFLP fragments were missing. C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization results indicated that T09 has a compensating Robertsonian translocation T7AL.7Lr#1S involving the long arm of wheat chromosome 7A and the short arm of Leymus chromosome 7Lr#1 substituting for chromosome arm 7AS of wheat. Introgression lines T01 (2n = 44) and T14 (2n = 44) each had two pairs of independent translocation chromosomes. T01 had T4BS.4BL-7Lr#1S + T4BL-7Lr#1S.5Lr#1S. T14 had T6BS.6BL-7Lr#1S + T6BL.5Lr#1S. These translocations were recovered in the progeny of the irradiated line Lr#1 (T5Lr#1S.7Lr#1S). The three translocation lines, T01, T09, and T14, and the disomic addition 7Lr#1 were consistently resistant to FHB in greenhouse point-inoculation experiments, whereas the disomic addition 5Lr#1 was susceptible. The data indicated that at least one novel FHB resistance gene from Leymus, designated Fhb3, resides in the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 7Lr#1, because the resistant translocation lines share a common distal segment of 7Lr#1S. Three PCR-based markers, BE586744-STS, BE404728-STS, and BE586111-STS, specific for 7Lr#1S were developed to expedite marker-assisted selection in breeding programs.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the major diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm23, identified in the common wheat Line 81-7241 and originally assigned to wheat chromosome 5A, was relocated on chromosome 2AL with the aid of molecular markers. Mapping of microsatellite markers in two wheat crosses segregating for Pm23 and Pm4b, respectively, in combination with the reported mapping of Pm4a, indicated that the three genes were all linked to the marker Xgwm356 with a distance of 3-5 cM. Allelism between Pm4b and Pm23 was then confirmed, when the progenies of a cross between VPM1 (Pm4b) and Line 81-7241, were shown to be all resistant to a B. graminis isolate avirulent to the both parents. Pm23 is therefore a new allele of the Pm4 locus, and was redesignated as Pm4c.

AB Net type net blotch (NTNB), caused by Pyrenophora teres f. teres Drechs., is prevalent in barley growing regions worldwide. A population of 118 doubled haploid (DH) lines developed from a cross between barley cultivars 'Rika' and 'Kombar' were used to evaluate resistance to NTNB due to their differential reaction to various isolates of P. teres f. teres. Rika was resistant to P. teres f. teres isolate 15A and susceptible to isolate 6A. Conversely, Kombar was resistant to 6A, but susceptible to 15A. A progeny isolate of a 15A x 6A cross identified as 15A x 6A#4 was virulent on both parental lines. The Rika/Kombar (RK) DH population was evaluated for disease reactions to the three isolates. Isolate 15A induced a resistant:susceptible ratio of 78:40 (R:S) whereas isolate 6A induced a resistant:susceptible ratio of 40:78. All but two lines had opposite disease reactions indicating two major resistance genes linked in repulsion. Progeny isolate 15A x 6A#4 showed a resistant:susceptible ratio of 1:117 with the one resistant line also being the single line that was resistant to both 15A and 6A. An RK F(2) population segregated in a 1:3 (R:S) ratio for both 15A and 6A indicating that resistance is recessive. Molecular markers were used to identify a region on chromosome 6H that harbors the two NTNB resistance genes. This work shows that multiple NTNB resistance genes exist at the locus on chromosome 6H, and the recombinant DH line harboring the resistance alleles from both parents will be useful for the development of NTNB-resistant barley germplasm.

AB As the staple food for 35% of the world's population, wheat is one of the most important crop species. To date, sequence- based tools to accelerate wheat improvement are lacking. As part of the international effort to sequence the 17- billion- base- pair hexaploid bread wheat genome ( 2n = 6x = 42 chromosomes), we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC)based integrated physical map of the largest chromosome, 3B, that alone is 995 megabases. A chromosome- specific BAC library was used to assemble 82% of the chromosome into 1036 contigs that were anchored with 1443 molecular markers, providing a major resource for genetic and genomic studies. This physical map establishes a template for the remaining wheat chromosomes and demonstrates the feasibility of constructing physical maps in large, complex, polyploid genomes with a chromosome- based approach.

AB Physiological studies suggest visceral spinal afferents are generally small diameter, unmyelinated C-fibers or myelinated A delta-fibers, but little is known about the size and chemical phenotypes of visceral sensory neurons supplying the small intestine. This study examines the size and expression patterns of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and isolectin B-4-binding (IB4) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons projecting to the gastrointestinal tract. The spinal afferent innervation of mouse jejunum and distal colon was investigated with retrograde neuronal tracing and multi-label immunohistochemistry. Expression of histochemical markers and soma sizes of retrogradely labeled DRG profiles were determined with confocal microscopy. Most (>75%) jejunal and colonic afferent neurons were medium- and large-sized cells. The majority (82%) of jejunal afferents expressed TRPV1, but few bound IB4. All retrogradely labeled jejunal afferents expressing NOS-immunoreactivity (64%) also expressed TRPV1 and CGRP and most expressed SP. Most labeled colonic afferents expressed TRPV1 (62%) and half expressed NOS. Taken together these data demonstrate that the spinal afferent supply of the jejunum and colon is largely from medium and large sensory neurons, suggesting most intestinal afferent axons are A fibers. The various chemically-defined subpopulations of afferents may play multiple roles in sensory innervation of the jejunum apart from nociceptive transduction. Additionally, we have identified a unique chemical code, TRPV1/NOS/CGRP/SP, that distinguishes many spinal afferent terminals from those of enteric neurons. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability of various environmental factors (root exudate from silver tussock, blue tussock, flax, wheat, ryegrass and lupin; simulated-root exudate; moisture; temperature; soil density; salinity; sewage sludge; fertiliser; pesticide) to promote or inhibit transformation of the soil-dwelling bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi BD413 (pFG4 Delta nptII) was investigated using soil microcosm studies. A marker-rescue system was used to monitor the transfer of a functional nptII gene from exogenous chromosomal DNA to A. baylyi BD413 (pFG4 Delta nptII). Significant differences were detected in A. baylyi BD413 (pFG4 Delta nptII) transformation rates in three sterile New Zealand agricultural soils. Addition of simulated-root exudate to the sterile soil was essential for transformation of A. baylyi BD413 (pFG4 Delta nptII) in the soil types tested, but addition of plant exudates collected from a variety of New Zealand cropping and native plants did not promote transformation rates to above detectable limits. Increases in soil temperature and bulk density increased the transformation rate but this effect was not consistent across all three soil types. Application of sewage sludge to sterile soils significantly increased transformation in the sandy soil but not in the silt loam and fine sandy loam soil types. Fertiliser (superphosphate) and herbicide (glyphosate) applied at agronomic rates did not affect transformation rates; however, when used at 5x and 50x the agronomic rate respectively, transformation was significantly reduced in all three sterile soils. These results suggest that competence and transformation of the A. baylyi BD413 (pFG4 Delta nptII) in soils is highly dependent on the presence of nutrients and is also influenced by the soil texture.

AB In the introgression of the distinguished powdery mildew resistance from Haynaldia villosa to wheat, a focus task is to develop applicable molecular markers for tracing alien genetic substances and breeding selection. In an attempt to breed wheat breeding lines combining powdery Mildew resistance of wheat stock 010714 conferred by alien 6V chromosome from H. villosa with thermo-photo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) from wheat line C050S, a molecular marker RM874 was identified in PCR amplification using RAPD primer S2018. Batched sequencing indicated that the band contained large amounts of equal-length homologues amplified from TY3-gypsy retro-transposon-like repetitive regions. Based on comparative cloning and bioinformatic analysis, it was converted into a more reproducible sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker SM142. In wheat genetic background, the marker is 6V-specific and linked to powdery Mildew resistance. The linkage of the marker is further verified in F5 generation. The approach of transforming repetitive regions-derived RAPD band into a specific SCAR marker can be referred for SCAR marker development of other genes. GISH (Genome in situ hybridization) analysis of 010714 and F(7) translocation lines indicated that the resistance gene is conferred by the short arm of 6V.

AB Wild rice is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L., AA genome). Molecular markers are important tools for monitoring gene introgression from wild rice into cultivated rice. In this study, Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to analyze interspecific hybrids of O. sativa-O. officinalis (CC genome), the backcrossing progenies and the parent plants. Results showed that most of the SSR primers (335 out of 396, 84.6%) developed in cultivated rice successfully amplified products from DNA samples of wild rice O. officinalis. The polymorphism ratio of SSR bands between O. sativa and O. officinalis was as high as 93.9%, indicating differences between the two species with respect to SSRs. When the SSR markers were applied in the interspecific hybrids, only a portion of SSR primers amplified O. officinalis-specific bands in the F(1) hybrid (52.5%), BC(1) (52.5%), and MAALs (37.0%); a number of the bands disappeared. Of the 124 SSR loci that detected officinalis-specific bands in MAAL plants, 96 (77.4%) showed synteny between the A and C-genomes, and 20 (16.1%) showed duplication in the C-genome. Sequencing analysis revealed that indels, substitution and duplication contribute to the diversity of SSR loci between the genomes of O. sativa and O. officinalis.

AB Triticeae contains hundreds of species of both annual and perennial types. Although substantial genomic tools are available for annual Triticeae cereals such as wheat and barley, the perennial Triticeae lack sufficient genomic resources for genetic mapping or diversity research. To increase the amount of sequence information available in the perennial Triticeae, three expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries were developed and annotated for Pseudoroegneria spicata, a mixture of both Elymus wawawaiensis and E. lanceolatus, and a Leymus cinereus x L. triticoides interspecific hybrid. The ESTs were combined into unigene sets of 8780 unigenes for P. spicata, 11281 unigenes for Leymus, and 7212 unigenes for Elymus. Unigenes were annotated based on putative orthology to genes from rice, wheat, barley, other Poaceae, Arabidopsis, and the non-redundant database of the NCBI. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed, tested for amplification and polymorphism, and aligned to the rice genome. Leymus EST markers homologous to rice chromosome 2 genes were syntenous on Leymus homeologous groups 6a and 6b (previously 1b), demonstrating promise for in silico comparative mapping. All ESTs and SSR markers are available on an EST information management and annotation database (http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/triticeae/).

AB The objectives of this study were to clarify the relationship between LMW-GS Glu-D3 gene of Ae. tauschii registered in GenBank and the six Glu-D3 genes including 12 allelic variants of common wheat characterized in our previous studies, and identify novel Glu-D3 genes and haplotypes from Ae. tauschii using gene specific PCR amplification. By searching the NCBI database, 13 LMW-GS genes/pseudogenes of Ae. tauschii were retrieved and classified into five gene families based on their nucleotide similarity with the six Glu-D3 genes of common wheat. Of them, four Ae. tauschii genes, AY585350, AY585354, AY585355 and AY585356 matched GluD3-4, GluD3-5, GluD3-1 and GluD3-2 of common wheat, respectively, and one pseudogene AY585351 matched to GluD3-6, but none of them matched to GluD3-3. In order to identify the Glu-D3 genes from Ae. tauschii corresponding to GluD3-3 and GluD3-6 of common wheat, gene specific primers were developed to amplify 8-18 Ae. tauschii entries. As a result, two novel Glu-D3 genes, designated as GluDt3-3 and GluDt3-6, were identified. GluDt3-3 showed seven allelic variants or haplotypes at the DNA level in eight Ae. tauschii entries, designated as GluDt3-31, GluDt3-32, GluDt3-33, GluDt3-34, GluDt3-35, GluDt3-36 and GluDt3-37, respectively. Two to eight SNPs were found among the seven haplotypes and 1-4 amino acid substitutions among the deduced peptides. Multiple sequence alignments showed that the DNA similarity was 99.6-99.9% among the seven GluDt3-3 haplotypes, and 99.4-99.7% between these haplotypes and those of common wheat GluD3-3 gene. GluDt3-6 presented seven haplotypes in 18 Ae. tauschii entries, designated as GluDt3-61, GluDt3-62, GluDt3-63, GluDt3-64, GluDt3-65, GluDt3-66 and GluDt3-67, respectively. GluDt3-61 from Ae. tauschii entry Ae38 was the only one haplotype with complete coding sequence, and the other six were all pseudogenes. Compared with GluD3-6 gene of common wheat, GluDt3-61 exhibited a 3-bp insertion, a 42-bp deletion and 11 base substitutions, leading to a glutamine insertion in position 52, 14 amino acid deletion in position 84-97 and 10 amino acid mutations in its deduced peptide; GluDt3-62 and GluDt3-63 showed a 6-bp insertion, a 24-bp deletion and 15-21 base substitutions in coding region, of which a nonsense mutation from C to T at position 622 resulted in pseudogenes; GluDt3-64 had five base substitution, including a nonsense mutation at the position 742. GluDt3-65, GluDt3-66 and GluDt3-67 all had a base deletion at position 247, as well as 7-8 base substitutions, which resulted in frameshift mutations in the three haplotypes. The results indicated that Ae. tauschii also contains six Glu-D3 genes and their allelic variants are even richer than those in common wheat.

AB A few EST-derived STS markers localized on Qfhs.ndsu-3BS, a major QTL for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, have been previously identified in the 'Sumai 3'/'Stoa' population. In this study, we used a 'Wangshuibai' (resistant) /'Seri82' (susceptible) derived population, linkage group, QTL, and quantitative gene expression analysis to assess the genetic background dependence and stability of the EST-derived STS markers for use in marker aided selection to improve FHB resistance in wheat. Based on our results, a QTL in the map interval of Xsts3B-138_1-Xgwm493 on chromosome 3BS was detected for FHB resistance, which accounted for up to 16% of the phenotypic variation. BLASTN analysis indicated that Xsts3B-138_1 sequence had significant similarity with the resistance gene analogue. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the relative expression of Xsts3B-138_1 in 'Wangshuibai' at 96 h after inoculation was 2.6 times higher than 'Seri82'. Our results underlined that EST-derived STS3B-138 markers could be predominantly used in marker aided selection to improve FHB resistance in wheat.

AB Terminal drought tolerance of wheat is a major target in many areas in the world and is a particular focus in Western Australia. It is widely considered to relate to water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) levels such as fructan in the stem, as the head is maturing. Fructan exohydrolases are key enzymes during both fructan biosynthesis and mobilization. The wheat genome sequences of three fructan 1-exohydrolase (1-FEH) genes with seven exons and six introns were isolated by using the available 1-FEH w2 cDNA sequence. The major size differences among the three genes were located in intron 1 and intron 4. The three 1-FEH genes were mapped to Chinese Spring chromosome 6A, 6B and 6D based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) polymorphisms and Southern hybridization. 1-FEH-6A, -6B and -6D corresponded to published cDNA sequences 1-FEH w1, w3 and w2, respectively. The overall correlation of the mRNA accumulation profile for the 1-FEH genes in stem and sheath leaf tissue in relation to the profile of soluble carbohydrate accumulation was consistent with their postulated role in stem soluble carbohydrate accumulation. The accumulation of the 1-FEH-6B (1-FEH w3) mRNA was 300 fold greater than that of 1-FEH-6A and -6D. The mRNA accumulation continued after the stem water soluble carbohydrate concentrations reached a peak, consistent with a role of 1-FEH-6B in the breakdown of soluble carbohydrate. The relationship between the 1-FEH genes and soluble carbohydrate accumulation is discussed and the 1-FEH-6B gene in particular is suggested to provide a new class of molecular marker for this trait.

AB Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are members of the family of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-14) that are believed to be involved in plant defense responses. In this study, a novel gene Ltp 3F1 encoding an antifungal protein from wheat (Sumai 3) was subcloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) and enriched using ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by gel permeation chromatography. Molecular phylogeny analyses of wheat Ltp 3171 gene showed a strong identity to other plant LTPs. Predicted three-dimensional structural model showed the presence of 6 alpha-helices and 9 loop turns. The active site catalytic residues Gly30, Pro50, Ala52 and Cys55 may be suggested for catalyzing the reaction involved in lipid binding. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the production of recombinant fusion protein. The UP fusion protein exhibited a broad-spectrum antifungal activity against Alternaria sp., Rhizoctonia solani, Curvularia lunata, Bipolaris oryzae, Cylindrocladium scoparium, Botrytis cinerea and Sarocladium oryzae. Gene cassette with cyanamide hydratase (cah) marker and Ltp 3F1 gene was constructed for genetic transformation in tobacco. Efficient regeneration was achieved in selective media amended with cyanamide. Transgenic plants with normal phenotype were obtained. Results of PCR and Southern, Northern and Western hybridization analyses confirmed the integration and expression of genes in transgenic plants. Experiments with detached leaves from transgenic tobacco expressing Ltp 3F1 gene showed fungal resistance. Due to the innate potential of broad-spectrum antifungal activity, wheat Ltp 3F1 gene can be used to enhance resistance against fungi in crop plants. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Background: Hordeum chilense, a native South American diploid wild barley, is a potential source of useful genes for cereal breeding. The use of this wild species to increase genetic variation in cereals will be greatly facilitated by marker-assisted selection. Different economically feasible approaches have been undertaken for this wild species with limited direct agricultural use in a search for suitable and cost-effective markers. The availability of Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) derived microsatellites or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, commonly called as EST-SSRs, for barley (Hordeum vulgare) represents a promising source to increase the number of genetic markers available for the H. chilense genome.
   Results: All of the 82 barley EST-derived SSR primer pairs tested for transferability to H. chilense amplified products of correct size from this species. Of these 82 barley EST-SSRs, 21 (26%) showed polymorphism among H. chilense lines. Identified polymorphic markers were used to test the transferability and polymorphism in other Poaceae family species with the aim of establishing H. chilense phylogenetic relationships. Triticum aestivum-H. chilense addition lines allowed us to determine the chromosomal localizations of EST-SSR markers and confirm conservation of the linkage group.
   Conclusion: From the present study a set of 21 polymorphic EST-SSR markers have been identified to be useful for diversity analysis of H. chilense, related wild barleys like H. murinum, and for wheat marker-assisted introgression breeding. Across-genera transferability of the barley ESTSSR markers has allowed phylogenetic inference within the Triticeae complex.

AB Background: Plant transformation is an invaluable tool for basic plant research, as well as a useful technique for the direct improvement of commercial crops. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop in the world. It also provides a useful model for the study of wheat, which has a larger and more complex genome. Most existing barley transformation methodologies are either complex or have low (< 10%) transformation efficiencies.
   Results: A robust, simple and reproducible barley transformation protocol has been developed that yields average transformation efficiencies of 25%. This protocol is based on the infection of immature barley embryos with Agrobacterium strain AGL1, carrying vectors from the pBract series that contain the hpt gene (conferring hygromycin resistance) as a selectable marker. Results of large scale experiments utilising the luc (firefly luciferase) gene as a reporter are described. The method presented here has been used to produce hundreds of independent, transgenic plant lines and we show that a large proportion of these lines contain single copies of the luc gene.
   Conclusion: This protocol demonstrates significant improvements in both efficiency and ease of use over existing barley transformation methods. This opens up opportunities for the development of functional genomics resources in barley.

AB Background: Rye (Secale cereale L.) belongs to tribe Triticeae and is an important temperate cereal. It is one of the parents of man-made species Triticale and has been used as a source of agronomically important genes for wheat improvement. The short arm of rye chromosome 1 (1RS), in particular is rich in useful genes, and as it may increase yield, protein content and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, it has been introgressed into wheat as the 1BL. 1RS translocation. A better knowledge of the rye genome could facilitate rye improvement and increase the efficiency of utilizing rye genes in wheat breeding. Results: Here, we report on BAC end sequencing of 1,536 clones from two 1RS-specific BAC libraries. We obtained 2,778 (90.4%) useful sequences with a cumulative length of 2,032,538 bp and an average read length of 732 bp. These sequences represent 0.5% of 1RS arm. The GC content of the sequenced fraction of 1RS is 45.9%, and at least 84% of the 1RS arm consists of repetitive DNA. We identified transposable element junctions in BESs and developed insertion site based polymorphism markers (ISBP). Out of the 64 primer pairs tested, 17 (26.6%) were specific for 1RS. We also identified BESs carrying microsatellites suitable for development of 1RS-specific SSR markers. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the utility of chromosome arm-specific BAC libraries for targeted analysis of large Triticeae genomes and provides new sequence data from the rye genome and molecular markers for the short arm of rye chromosome 1.

AB Two new T1BL.1RS translocation lines, 48112 and 89121, derived from cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar "Xiaoyan No. 6" and rye (Secale cereale L.) cultivar "German White", were developed and identified by using of molecular markers and cytogenetical methods, GISH and FISH. PCR results of primers NOR-R1 specific for rye and Glu-B3 for 1BS detected the presence of 1RS chromatin and absence of 1BS, and primer for gene 1Bx14 in 1BL indicated the existence of chromosome arm 1BL in the two lines. GISH and FISH methods confirmed the replacement of chromosome arm 1BS with 1RS. Further stripe rust resistant test and quality analysis demonstrated that the new 1BL.1RS translocation lines were higher resistant to mixed races of P. striiformis Westend and observed considerable better quality than other popularized T1BL.1RS cultivars in China. The two lines have been used in wheat breeding for high-yield potential and rust resistance.

AB In this study, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used on Larix leptolepis x Larix olgensis hybrids to identify a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker associated with high rooting ability in larch. Two DNA bulks: H (high rooting ability) bulk and L (low rooting ability) bulk were constructed according to the rooting percentages of the stock plants. Among the 328 primers, only S356 could amplify a specific band, named S356(445), which only existed in the H bulk and was further confirmed following selective genotyping of individual hybrids. Grounded on the border sequences, S356(445) was converted to a sequence characterized amplified region ( SCAR) marker, HRL445, which can be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) to screen for larch with high rooting ability. All the results strongly indicated that S356(445) and HRL445 were closely associated with high rooting ability in larch.

AB In order to investigate the origin of two 4B-5R wheat-rye translocations a number of microsatellite markers were considered, (a) which were specific for the rye chromosome arm 5RL and (b) which should enable precise characterisation for the gene pool of a 'Cornell' wheat derivative. Seven out of eight markers revealed amplification fragments with the rye control, while the marker WMS0186 amplified only a PCR product with the appropriate chromosome arm of the wheat control. The heterogeneity of the DNA fragment patterns among five wheat-rye translocation lines confirms different wheat backgrounds of the American, Danish/UK, Hungarian, and Swedish Sources of the 4B-5R translocations. The homogeneous DNA marker patterns of 'Viking-hairy neck' and 'Cornell Sel. 82a1-2-4-7' are particularly clear. The corresponding molecular markers together with the cytological data, genomic in situ hybridisation, the physiological investigations, and the historical review support the hypothesis of it common origin of 'Viking-hairy neck' and 'Cornell Sel. 82a1-2-4-7'. The importance of the results for practical breeding and for introgression experiments is discussed.

AB Growing resistant wheat cultivars is considered to be an efficient and environmentally safe approach in reducing damage caused by leaf rust disease. Among the numerous leaf rust resistance genes of wheat, Lr52 is a very effective one with a broad spectrum resistance. The objective of this study was to identify and map molecular markers closely linked to the Lr52 resistance gene. Out of 290 RAPD, 44 SSR and 8 STS markers tested, three showed close linkage to the Lr52. In our Study, one SSR marker (Xwmc149) showed a close linkage (11.3 cM) to the Lr52 gene. Another SSR (Xgwm234) and an STS (Xtxw200) markers, having close linkage to a recently identified leaf rust resistance gene found in P1 289824, also showed a close linkage (7.2 and 3.6 cM, respectively) to the Lr52. Matchings in the mapping distances of these markers linked to these resistance genes still remain open the possibility that the gene found in P1 289824 is identical to the Lr52, or simply this locate very close to it.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize the Italian rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene pool, paying particular attention to its variation over time, to determine whether human activity can reduce genetic variability, and whether such a reduction actually occurred in Italian rice varieties. We analyzed 135 Italian rice accessions, representing genotypes either introduced from abroad or developed in Italy from 1880 to 2001, using two groups of molecular markers, amplified fragment length polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats. These accessions were divided into four groups for which different statistical analyses were performed. The levels of gene diversity, from 0.1023 to 0.1921, and genetic richness, from 0.1579 to 0.3064, increased over time. Genetic structure, as estimated by analysis of molecular variance, revealed that the within-component was overwhelmingly dominant (92%) compared with the among-component. These results show that the level of genetic diversity in Italian rice accessions has remained high since 1850 and continues to increase. This is most likely the result of Italian breeding programs that developed new cultivars and introduced others from abroad, without substituting previous accessions. Our results show that the management and improvement of rice germplasm in Italy have been successful in maintaining sufficient genetic diversity.

AB The Lr34/Yr18 adult plant resistance gene contributes significantly to durable leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.) resistance. Simple and robust molecular markers that enable early detection of Lr34/Yr18 are a major advancement in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding. An insertion/deletion size variant located at the csLV34 locus on chromosome 7D within an intron sequence of a sulfate transporter-like gene tightly linked to the Lr34/Yr18 dual rust resistance gene was used to examine a global collection of wheat cultivars, landraces, and D genome-containing diploid and polyploid species of wheat relatives. Two predominant allelic size variants, csLV34a and b, found among the wheat cultivars showed disparate variation in different wheat growing zones. A strong association was observed between the presence of Lr34/Yr18 and the csLV34b allele and wheat lines known to have Lr34/Yr18 that had the csLV34a allele were rare. All landraces with the exception of those from China were predominantly of the csLV34a type. Only one size variant, csLV34a, was detected among the diploid and polyploid D genome-containing species, indicating that csLV34b arose subsequent to hexaploid bread wheat synthesis. The lineage of the csLV34b allele associated with Lr34/Yr18 in modern wheat cultivars from North and South America, CIMMYT, Australia, and Russia was tracked back to the cultivars Mentana and Ardito developed in Italy by Nazareno Strampelli in the early 1900s. The robustness of the csLV34 marker in postulating the likely occurrence of Lr34/Yr18 across a wide range of wheat germplasm and its utility in wheat breeding was confirmed.

AB The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm6, transferred to common wheat from the tetraploid Triticum timopheevii, is effective in most epidemic areas for powdery mildew in China. RFLP probe BCD135 was previously associated with Pm6. In the present research, four STS primers (NAU/STSBCD135-1, NAU/STSBCD135-2, STS003 and STS004) were designed from the sequence data of BCD135. These primers were used for PCR amplification using the genomic DNA of resistant near-isogenic lines with Pm6 and their recurrent parent, cv. Prins. No polymorphic product was observed using primers STS003 and STS004; however, primers NAU/STSBCD135-1 and NAU/STSBCD135-2 amplified two and one bands, respectively, polymorphic between the resistant near-isogenic-lines and Prins. The two primers were then used to amplify the F-2 population from the cross IGV1-465 (FAO163b/7*Prins) x Prins. The amplification and the powdery mildew resistance identification data were analyzed using the software Mapmaker 3.0. The results indicated that both NAU/STSBCD135-1 and NAU/STSBCD135-2 were closely linked to Pm6 with a genetic distance of 0.8 cM. A total of 175 commercial varieties without Pm6 from different ecological areas of China were tested using marker NAU/STSBCD135-2 and none of them amplified the 230 bp-specific band. This marker thus has high practicability and can be used in MAS of Pm6 in wheat breeding programs for powdery mildew resistance.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), or scab, is a devastating wheat disease worldwide, reducing both grain yield and quality. The percentage of Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) directly reflects the damage level caused by scab on wheat grains and its variation represents the so-called type IV scab resistance in germplasm. To identify genes governing type IV resistance and investigate its relationship with other scab resistance types, we mapped QTLs associated with percent FDK using data from three different field evaluations of the recombination inbred line (RIL) population derived from the susceptible cultivar Nanda 2419 x the scab-resistant cultivar Wangshuibai. Five QTLs related to percent FDK were identified in at least two different trials, for which Wangshuibai contributed four of the resistance alleles. Most of the FDK-related QTLs, including the three with larger effects, QFdk.nau-2B, QFdk.nau-3B and QFdk.nau-4B, mapped to intervals associated with either type IV resistance or type II resistance. Moreover, most of the major type I and type II resistance QTLs detected previously were associated with type IV resistance, suggesting that resistance to initial infection and disease spread play major roles in conditioning less FDK. Therefore, breeders have options to choose inoculation methods based on their expertise and resources without risking significant loss of information when using percent FDK as the disease index. The most useful scab resistance QTLs for breeding would be those with stable influences on FDK and/or deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation besides the initial infection and disease spread.

AB The spikes of club wheat are significantly more compact than spikes of common wheat due to the action of the dominant allele of the compactum (C) locus. Little is known about the location of C on chromosome 2D and the relationship between C and to other spike-compacting genes. Thus, a study was undertaken to place C on linkage maps and a chromosome deletion bin, and to assess its relatedness to the spike compacting genes zeocriton (Zeo) from barley and soft glume (Sog) from T. monococcum. Genetic mapping was based on recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between the cultivars Coda (club) and Brundage (common) and F(2) progeny from a cross between the club wheat Corrigin and a chromosome 2D substitution line [Chinese Spring (Ae. tauschii 2D)]. The C locus was flanked by Xwmc144 and Xwmc18 in the RIL population and it was completely linked to Xcfd116, Xgwm358 and Xcfd17 in the F(2) population. C could not be unambiguously placed to a chromosome bin because markers that were completely linked to C or flanked this locus were localized to chromosome bins on either side of the centromere (C-2DS1 and C-2DL3). Since C has been cytogenetically mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2D, we suspect C is located in bin C-2DL3. Comparative mapping suggested that C and Sog were present in homoeologous regions on chromosomes 2D and 2A(m), respectively. On the other hand, C and Zeo, on chromosome 2H, did not appear to be orthologous.

AB Drought is one of the major factors limiting barley yields in many developing countries worldwide. The identification of molecular markers linked to genes controlling drought tolerance in barley is one way to improve breeding efficiency. In this study, we analyzed the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence in 194 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the cross between the cultivar 'Arta' and Hordeum spontaneum 41-1. Five traits, chlorophyll content, and four chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, namely initial fluorescence (F-o), maximum fluorescence (F-m), variable fluorescence (F-v), and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) which are related to the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus, were measured under well-watered and drought stress conditions at post-flowering stage. QTL analysis identified a total of nine and five genomic regions, under well-watered and drought stress conditions, respectively, that were significantly associated with the expression of the five target traits at post-flowering stage. No common QTL was detected except one for chlorophyll content, which was identified in both growth conditions, demonstrating that the genetic control of the expression of the traits related to photosynthesis differed under different water conditions. A QTL for F-v/F-m, which is related to the drought tolerance of photosynthesis was identified on chromosome 2H at 116 cM in the linkage map under drought stress. This QTL alone explained more than 15% of phenotypic variance of maximum quantum yield of PSII, and was also associated with the expression of four other traits. In addition, another QTL for F-v/F-m was also located on the same chromosome (2H) but at 135.7 cM explaining around 9% of the phenotypic variance under drought conditions. The result presented here suggest that two major loci, located on chromosome 2H, are involved in the development of functional chloroplast at post-flowering stage for drought tolerance of photosynthesis in barley under drought stress. If validated in other populations, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters could be used as selection criteria for drought tolerance.

AB A new mutation at the acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) locus on chromosome 6D of wheat was analyzed in detail because it conferred an improved resistance to the imidazolinone group of herbicides. Sequence analysis showed that the mutation was at the Ala122 position (A122T), a position in AHAS which has not to date been identified in imidazolinone resistant wheat lines even though the position has been identified in other plants and is associated with resistance. An allele-specific assay for the mutation (in the wheat line Brookton-8) was developed and used in a genetic analysis. Two mapping populations were analysed and the doubled haploid progeny from the cross Brookton-8 x Clearfield STL proved to be most informative. The AHAS(Ala122) mutation (A122T) was allelic to the AHAS(Ser653) mutation (S653N) in Clearfield STL (Imi1, on chromosome 6D) and hence was assigned to the chromosome 6D locus. The analysis of the doubled haploid lines in the mapping population demonstrated the greater resistance conferred by the A122T mutation because lines from the same cross and carrying either the A122T or S653N mutations could be directly compared.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes with strong interaction between environment and genotype that makes it difficult to select breeding materials by phenotypic assessment. One of the most important genes for pre-harvest sprouting resistance is consistently identified on the long arm of chromosome 4A. The 4AL PHS tolerance gene has therefore been targeted by Australian white-grained wheat breeders. A new robust PCR marker for the PHS QTL on wheat chromosome 4AL based on candidate genes search was developed in this study. The new marker was mapped on 4AL deletion bin 13-0.59-0.66 using 4AL deletion lines derived from Chinese Spring. This marker is located on 4AL between molecular markers Xbarc170 and Xwg622 in the doubled-haploid wheat population Cranbrook x Halberd. It was mapped between molecular markers Xbarc170 and Xgwm269 that have been previously shown to be closely linked to grain dormancy in the doubled haploid wheat population SW95-50213 x Cunningham and was co-located with Xgwm269 in population Janz x AUS1408. This marker offers an additional efficient tool for marker-assisted selection of dormancy for white-grained wheat breeding. Comparative analysis indicated that the wheat chromosome 4AL QTL for seed dormancy and PHS resistance is homologous with the barley QTL on chromosome 5HL controlling seed dormancy and PHS resistance. This marker will facilitate identification of the gene associated with the 4A QTL that controls a major component of grain dormancy and PHS resistance.

AB Rust fungi can overcome the effect of host resistance genes rapidly, and spores can disperse long distance by wind. Here we demonstrate a foreign incursion of similar strains of the wheat yellow rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, in North America, Australia and Europe in less than 3 years. One strain defined by identity at 15 virulence loci and 130 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments was exclusive to North America (present since 2000) and Australia (since 2002). Another strain of the same virulence phenotype, but differing in two AFLP fragments, was exclusive to Europe (present since 2000-2001) as well as Western and Central Asia and the Red Sea Area (first appearance unknown). This may be the most rapid spread of an important crop pathogen on the global scale. The limited divergence between the two strains and their derivatives, and the temporal-spatial occurrence pattern confirmed a recent spread. The data gave evidence for additional intercontinental dispersal events in the past, that is, many isolates sampled before 2000 in Europe, North America and Australia had similar AFLP fingerprints, and isolates from South Africa, which showed no divergence in AFLP, differed by only two fragments from particular isolates from Central Asia, West Asia and South Europe, respectively. Previous research has demonstrated that isolates of the two new strains produced up to two to three times more spores per day than strains found in USA and Europe before 2000, suggesting that increased aggressiveness at this level may accelerate global spread of crop pathogens.

AB Gibberella zeae, a causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and barley, is one of the most economically harmful pathogens, of cereals in the United States. In recent years, the known host range of G. zeae has also expanded to noncereal crops. However, there is a lack of information on the population genetic Structure of G. zeae associated with noncereal crops and across wheat cultivars. To test the hypothesis that G. zeae populations sampled from barley. wheat, potato, and sugar beet in the Upper Midwest of the United States are]lot Mixtures of species or G. zeae clades, we analyzed sequence data of G. zeae, and confirmed that all populations studied were present in the same clade of G. zeae. Ten variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers were used to determine the genetic Structure of G. zeae from the four Crop Populations. To examine the effect of wheat cultivars on the pathogen populations, 227 strains Were Sampled from 10 subpopulations according to wheat cultivar types. The VNTR markers also were used to analyze the genetic Structure of these subpopulations. In all Populations, gene (H = 0.453 to 0.612) and genotype diversity (GD = >0.984) were high. There was little or no indication of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in all G. zeae populations and subpopulations. III addition, high gene flow (Nm) values were observed between cereal and noncereal populations (Nm = 10.69) and between FHB resistant and susceptible wheat cultivar subpopulations (Nm = 16.072). suggesting low Population differentiation of G. zeae in this region. Analysis of molecular variance also revealed high genetic variation (>80%) among individuals within populations and subpopulations. However, low genetic variation (<5%) was observed between cereal and noncereal populations and between resistant and Susceptible wheat subpopulations. Overall, these results suggest that the populations or subpopulations are likely a single large Population of G. zeae affecting crops in the upper Midwest of the United States.

AB Field trials with a population of 108 doubled haploid (DH) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) derived from a cross between the Chinese winter wheat cultivars CA9613 and H1488 were carried out at Beijing (China) in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002. In addition, a field trial and a pot experiment were carried out at the experimental field stations of Giessen University (Germany) in the vegetation periods 2004/ 2005 and 2006/2007. Phenotypic data for major agronomic yield-related traits, i.e. grain weight per ear (GWE), grain number per ear (GNE), plant height and thousand-grain weight (TGW), were recorded in all experiments. In addition, biomass weight per tiller and ear weight were evaluated in the two field trials at Beijing. Based on the phenotypic data and a genetic map comprising 168 SSR markers, an analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was carried out for yield and yield parameters using the composite interval mapping (CIM) approach. A total of 30 QTL were detected for these traits across four environments. Five of these QTL located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2B, 2D and 7D exhibited pleiotropic effects. Such pleiotropic gene loci will be very useful for understanding the homologous/homeologous relationships among QTL and designing an appropriate marker-assisted breeding programme including multi-trait selection in order to accumulate ("pyramide") favorable alleles at different genetic loci.

AB Profiles of total seed proteins isolated from mature seeds of four peanut cultivars, New Mexico Valencia C (NM Valencia C), Tamspan 90, Georgia Green, and NC-7, were studied using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with nano-electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS). Two-dimensional gels stained with silver nitrate revealed a total of 457, 516, 556, and 530 protein spots in NM Valencia C, Tamspan 90, Georgia Green, and NC-7, respectively. Twenty abundant protein spots showing differences in relative abundance among these cultivars were analyzed by nESI-LC-MS/MS, resulting in identification of 14 non-redundant proteins. The majority of these proteins belonged to the globulin fraction consisting of arachin (g)ycinin and Arah3/4) and conarachin seed storage proteins as well as other allergen proteins. The expression of some of these identified protein spots was cultivar-specific. For example, allergen Arah3/Arah4 and conarachin protein spots were only detected in Tamspan 90 and NC-7, whereas the Glyl protein spot was detected only in NM Valencia C and NC-7. Moreover, a galactose-binding lectin protein spot with anti-nutritive properties was only present in Tamspan 90. Other proteins showing differences in relative abundance among the four cultivars included 13-lipoxygenase, fructose-biphosphate aldolase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Together, these results suggest that identified proteins might serve as potential markers for cultivar differentiation and may be associated with underlying sensory and nutritional traits of peanut cultivars.

AB High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance from the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar 'Stephens' has protected wheat crops from stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici for 30 years. The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for HTAP resistance in Stephens through genetic linkage analysis and identify DNA markers linked to the QTL for use in marker-assisted breeding. Mapping populations consisted of 101 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) through single-seed descent from 'Stephens' (resistant) x 'Michigan Amber' (susceptible). F(5), F(6) and F(7) RILs were evaluated for stripe rust resistance at Pullman, WA in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, whereas F(8) RILs were evaluated at Mt Vernon, WA, USA in 2005. The 101 F(8) RILs were evaluated with 250 resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), 245 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 1 sequence tagged site (STS) markers for genetic linkage map construction. Two QTL, which explained 48-61% of the total phenotypic variation of the HTAP resistance in Stephens, were identified. QYrst.wgp-6BS.1 was within a 3.9-cM region flanked by Xbarc101 and Xbarc136. QYrst.wgp-6BS.2 was mapped in a 17.5-cM region flanked by Xgwm132 and Xgdm113. Both two QTL were physically mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6B, but in different bins. Validation and polymorphism tests of the flanking markers in 43 wheat genotypes indicated that the molecular markers associated with these QTL should be useful in marker-assisted breeding programs to efficiently incorporate HTAP resistance into new wheat cultivars.

TI Relationship between homoeologous regulatory and structural genes in
   allopolyploid genome - A case study in bread wheat

AB Background: The patterns of expression of homoeologous genes in hexaploid bread wheat have been intensively studied in recent years, but the interaction between structural genes and their homoeologous regulatory genes remained unclear. The question was as to whether, in an allopolyploid, this interaction is genome-specific, or whether regulation cuts across genomes. The aim of the present study was cloning, sequence analysis, mapping and expression analysis of F3H ( flavanone 3-hydroxylase - one of the key enzymes in the plant flavonoid biosynthesis pathway) homoeologues in bread wheat and study of the interaction between F3H and their regulatory genes homoeologues - Rc (red coleoptiles).
   Results: PCR-based cloning of F3H sequences from hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a wild tetraploid wheat (T. timopheevii) and their putative diploid progenitors was employed to localize, physically map and analyse the expression of four distinct bread wheat F3H copies. Three of these form a homoeologous set, mapping to the chromosomes of homoeologous group 2; they are highly similar to one another at the structural and functional levels. However, the fourth copy is less homologous, and was not expressed in anthocyanin pigmented coleoptiles. The presence of dominant alleles at the Rc-1 homoeologous loci, which are responsible for anthocyanin pigmentation in the coleoptile, was correlated with F3H expression in pigmented coleoptiles. Each dominant Rc-1 allele affected the expression of the three F3H homoeologues equally, but the level of F3H expression was dependent on the identity of the dominant Rc-1 allele present. Thus, the homoeologous Rc-1 genes contribute more to functional divergence than do the structural F3H genes.
   Conclusion: The lack of any genome-specific relationship between F3H-1 and Rc-1 implies an integrative evolutionary process among the three diploid genomes, following the formation of hexaploid wheat. Regulatory genes probably contribute more to the functional divergence between the wheat genomes than do the structural genes themselves. This is in line with the growing consensus which suggests that although heritable morphological traits are determined by the expression of structural genes, it is the regulatory genes which are the prime determinants of allelic identity.

AB Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs), a source of wheat stripe rust, take-all fungus, and powdery mildew resistance with tolerance to salinity and drought, has been successfully hybridized as the pollen parent to bread wheat without using immature embryo rescuing culture for the first time. All of the CSph2b x P. huashanica hybrid seeds germinate well. Backcross derivatives were successfully obtained. F(1) hybrids were verified as intergeneric hybrids on the basis of morphological observation, cytological and molecular analyses. The results obviously showed the phenotypes of the hybrid plants were intermediate between bread wheat and P. huashanica. Chromosome pairing at MI of PMCs in the F(1) hybrid plants was low, and the meiotic configuration was 26.80 I + 0.60 II (rod). Cytological analysis of the hybrid plants revealed the ineffectiveness of the ph2b gene on chromosome association between the parents. Eight RAPD-specific markers for Ns genome were selected for RAPD analysis, and the results indicated that F(1) hybrids contained the Ns genome of P. huashanica. Furthermore, the significance of the finding for bread wheat improvement was discussed.

AB Leaf rust caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina is one of the most important diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. The use of resistant wheat cultivars is considered the most economical and environment-friendly approach in controlling the disease. The Lr38 gene, introgressed from Agropyron intermedium, confers a stable seedling and adult plant resistance against multiple isolates tested in Europe. In the present study, 94 F(2) plants resulting from a cross made between the resistant Thatcher-derived near-isogenic line (NIL) RL6097, and the susceptible Ethiopian wheat cultivar Kubsa were used to map the Thatcher Lr38 locus in wheat using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Out of 54 markers tested, 15 SSRs were polymorphic between the two parents and subsequently genotyped in the population. The P. triticina isolate DZ7-24 (race FGJTJ), discriminating Lr38 resistant and susceptible plants, was used to inoculate seedlings of the two parents and the segregating population. The SSR markers Xwmc773 and Xbarc273 flanked the Lr38 locus at a distance of 6.1 and 7.9 cM, respectively, to the proximal end of wheat chromosome arm 6DL. The SSR markers Xcfd5 and Xcfd60 both flanked the locus at a distance of 22.1 cM to the distal end of 6DL. In future, these SSR markers can be used by wheat breeders and pathologists for marker assisted selection (MAS) of Lr38-mediated leaf rust resistance in wheat.

AB Seed component structures were grouped into maternal and offspring (embryo and endosperm) tissues to characterize a dormancy quantitative trait locus (QTL) for tissue-specific function using a marker-assisted genetic approach. The approach was devised to test if genotypic/allelic frequencies of a marker tightly linked to the QTL deviate from Mendelian expectations in germinated and nongerminated subpopulations derived from a segregation population of partially after-ripened seeds and was applied to the dormancy QTL qSD12 and qSD7-1 in a nearly isogenic background of rice. Experimental results unambiguously demonstrated that qSD12 functions in the offspring tissue(s) and suggested that qSD7-1 may control dormancy through the maternal tissues. These experiments also provide the first solid evidence that an offspring tissue-imposed dormancy gene contributes to the segregation distortion in a mapping population developed from partially after-ripened seeds and, in part, to the germination heterogeneity of seeds from hybrid plants. Offspring and maternal tissue-imposed dormancy genes express in very early and late stages of the life cycle, respectively, and interact to provide the species with complementary adaptation strategies. The qSD12 locus was narrowed to the region of similar to 600 kbp on high-resolution map to facilitate cloning and marker-assisted selection of the major dormancy gene.

Inhibition of fungal growth of Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium dahliae in the presence of bacterial culture filtrate provided the first clue to its biocontrol properties. In order to determine the basis for antifungal properties, antibiotics were extracted and analysed by TLC. Both pyrrolnitrin and phenazines could be detected in the culture of Psd. Presence of response regulator gene gacA of the two component regulatory system (GacS/GacA) was established by PCR amplification and sequencing. Sequence comparison of gacA justified the taxonomic position of this strain among the known members of Pseudomonadaceae. Synthesis of other compounds like toxic lipodepsipeptide, siderophores, and HCN was also confirmed by appropriate biochemical tests.
   Conclusion: Characterization of strain Psd by various biochemical/plate tests followed by chromatographic identification of antibiotics, demonstrates its multifunctional biocontrol property. Response regulator gene gacA provides an additional genetic marker for the phylogenetic studies.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Ps. fluorescens strain Psd with its multifunctional biocontrol property can be used to bioprotect the crop plants from phytopathogens.

AB A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) was identified on chromosome 3BS between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Xgwm389 and Xgwm493 in wheat "Ning 7840", a derivative from "Sumai 3". However, the marker density of SSR in the QTL region was much lower than that required for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and map-based cloning. The objective of this study was to exploit new markers to increase marker density in this QTL region by using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) markers developed from wheat-expressed sequence tags (ESTs) on 3BS bin 8-0.78-1.0. Sixty-nine out of 85 SSCP primer pairs amplified PCR (polymerase chain reaction) products from the genomic DNA of "Chinese Spring". Thirty-four primer pairs amplified PCR products that could form clear ssDNA (single strand DNA) bands through denaturation treatment. Ten SSCP markers had polymorphisms between Ning 7840 and "Clark". Five of the ten polymorphic SSCP markers were located on chromosome 3B by nullitetrasomic analysis. Three SSCP markers (Xsscp6, Xsscp20, and Xsscp21) were mapped into the region between Xgwm493 and Xgwm533 and possessed a higher coefficient of determination (R(2)) than Xgwm493 and Xgwm533. The SSCP markers, Xsscp6, Xsscp20, and Xsscp21, can be used for map-based cloning of the QTL and for marker-assisted selection in FHB resistance breeding.

AB Durable broad-spectrum, adult-plant stem rust resistance in wheat conferred by the Sr2 gene has remained effective against Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici worldwide for more than 50 years. The Sr2 gene has been positioned on the physical map of wheat to the distal 25% portion of the short arm of chromosome 3B. Selection for this gene in wheat breeding programs within Australia has been performed so far through the use of the linked pseudo black chaff (PBC) phenotype and of the microsatellite markers Xgwm389 and Xgwm533 that flank the gene. The molecular markers flank a genetic interval of approximately 4 cM equating to a physical distance of over 10 Mbp. Recently, a 3B-specific BAC library was developed and a physical map established for this region. Analysis of the sequence of minimal tiling path-BAC clones within the region containing the Sr2 gene enabled the development of three new markers that were mapped within the Xgwm389-Xgwm533 genetic interval and tightly linked to the Sr2 gene. Screening a wide range of germplasm containing the Sr2 gene with these markers demonstrated their usefulness for marker-assisted selection in Australian wheat breeding programs.

AB Colinearity in gene content and order between rice and closely related cereal crops has been a powerful tool for gene identification. Using a comparative genomic approach, we have identified the rice genomic region syntenous to the region of the short arm of wheat chromosome 2D, on which quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance and for controlling accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) are closely located. Utilizing markers known to reside near the FHB resistance QTL and data from several wheat genetic maps, we have limited the syntenous region to 6.8 Mb of the short arm of rice chromosome 4. From the 6.8-Mb sequence of rice chromosome 4, we found three putative rice genes that could have a role in detoxification of mycotoxins. DNA sequences of these putative rice genes were used in BLAST searches to identify wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) exhibiting significant similarity. Combined data from expression analysis and gene mapping of wheat homologues and results of analysis of DON accumulation using doubled haploid populations revealed that a putative gene for multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) is a possible candidate for the FHB resistance and/or DON accumulation controlling QTLs on wheat chromosome 2DS and can be used as a molecular marker to eliminate the susceptible allele when the Chinese wheat variety Sumai 3 is used as a resistance source.

AB Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) caused by Stagonospora nodorum is a severe disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many areas of the world. S. nodorum affects both seedling and adult plants causing necrosis of leaf and glume tissue, inhibiting photosynthetic capabilities, and reducing grain yield. The aims of this study were to evaluate disease response of 280 doubled haploid (DH) individuals derived from a cross between resistant (6HRWSN125) and susceptible (WAWHT2074) genotypes, compare quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seedling and adult plant resistance in two consecutive years, and assess the contribution of QTL on grain weight. Flag leaves and glumes of individuals from the DH population were inoculated with mixed isolates of S. nodorum at similar maturity time to provide accurate disease evaluation independent of morphological traits and identify true resistance for QTL analysis. Fungicide protected and inoculated plots were used to measure relative grain weight (RGW) as a yield-related trait under pathogen infection. The lack of similar QTL and little or no correlation in disease scores indicate different genes control seedling and adult plant disease and independent genes control flag leaf and glume resistance. This study consistently identified a QTL on chromosome 2DL for flag leaf resistance (QSnl.daw-2D) and 4BL for glume resistance (QSng.daw-4B) from the resistant parent, 6HRWSN125, explaining 4 to 19% of the phenotypic variation at each locus. A total of 5 QTL for RGW were consistently detected, where two were in the same marker interval for QSnl.daw-2D and QSng.daw-4B indicating the contribution of these QTL to yield related traits. Therefore, RGW measurement in QTL analysis could be used as a reliable indicator of grain yield affected by S. nodorum infection.

AB Wheat lines known as 'Lankao 90(6)', derived from the cross 'Mzalenod Beer' (hexaploid triticale)/'Baofeng 7228'//'90 Xuanxi', carry a recessive powdery mildew resistance gene temporarily named PmLK906. Gene PmLK906 appears to be different from known wheat powdery mildew resistance genes. PmLK906 was tagged using microsatellite markers in a segregating population derived from the cross 'Chinese Spring'/'Lankao 90(6)21-12'. The dominant microsatellite marker Xgwm265-2AL was linked in repulsion with PmLK906 at a genetic distance of 3.72 cM, whereas the co-dominant Xgdm93-2AL was linked to PmLK906 at a genetic distance of 6.15 cM. Both markers were placed on chromosome arm 2AL using 'Chinese Spring' nulli-tetrasomic lines. The recessive PmLK906 has a different specificity to the dominant resistance alleles located at the Pm4 locus and appeared to be located to a locus different from Pm4.

AB The objective of this study was to map resistance gene analogues (RGA) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for powdery mildew resistance in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The mapping population consisted of 184 F(2) genotypes produced from a cross between one genotype of a synthetic perennial ryegrass variety Veyo and one genotype from the perennial ryegrass ecotype Falster. The greenhouse infection was measured as number of sporulating colonies on a 10-cm leaf area with the maximum possible number of colonies to be counted set to 50. The range of infection scores in the population was 0-50 and the heritability was 71.7%. In total, two QTL for powdery mildew resistance were identified, and mapped to linkage groups (LG) LG3 and LG7. Individually, these QTL explained between 7.5% and 22.1% of the total phenotypic variation. Six RGA and three laccases were mapped to LG2, LG3, LG4, LG5 and LG7, however, no close linkage between RGA and QTL was observed.

AB Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is a target enzyme for many herbicides, including sulfonylurea and imidazolinone. We investigated the usefulness of a mutated ALS gene of rice, which had double point mutations and encoded an herbicide-resistant form of the enzyme, as a selectable marker for wheat transformation. After the genomic DNA fragment from rice containing the mutated ALS gene was introduced into immature embryos by means of particle bombardment, transgenic plants were efficiently selected with the herbicide bispyribac sodium (BS). Southern blot analysis confirmed that transgenic plants had one to more than ten copies of the transgene in their chromosomes. Adjustment of the BS concentration combined with repeated selection effectively prevented nontransgenic plants from escaping herbicide selection. Measurement of ALS activity indicated that transgenic plants produced an herbicide-resistant form of ALS and therefore had acquired the resistance to BS. This report is the first to describe a selection system for wheat transformation that uses a selectable marker gene of plant origin.

ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; AUSTRALIA; MAP
AB Hypersensitive adult plant resistance genes Lr48 and Lr49 were named based on their genetic independence of the known adult plant resistance genes. This study was planned to determine genomic locations of these genes. Recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses involving CSP44 and VL404, sources of Lr48 and Lr49, respectively, and the susceptible parent WL711, were used to determine the genomic locations of these genes. Bulked segregant analyses were performed using multiplex-ready PCR technology. Lr48 in genotype CSP44 was mapped on chromosome arm 2BS flanked by marker loci Xgwm429b (6.1 cM) and Xbarc7 (7.3 cM) distally and proximally, respectively. Leaf rust resistance gene Lr13, carried by the alternate parent WL711, was proximal to Lr48 and was flanked by Xksm58 (5.1 cM) and Xstm773-2 (8.7 cM). Lr49 was flanked by Xbarc163 (8.1 cM) and Xwmc349 (10.1 cM) on chromosome arm 4BL. The likely presence of the durable leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 in both CSP44 and VL404 was confirmed using the tightly linked marker csLV34. Near-isogenic lines for Lr48 and Lr49 were developed in cultivar Lal Bahadur.

AB DNA polymorphisms are valuable for several applications including genotyping, molecular mapping and marker-assisted selection. The 55 K Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip was used to survey expression level polymorphisms (ELPs) and single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) between two near-isogenic wheat genotypes (BC(7):F(4)) that differ for the Yr5 stripe rust resistance locus, with the objective of developing genetic markers linked to Yr5. Ninety-one probe sets showing ELPs and 118 SFP-containing probe sets were identified between isolines, of which just nine ELP probe sets also contained SFPs. The proportion of the transcriptome estimated to be variable between isolines from this analysis was 0.30% for the ELPs and 0.39% for the SFPs, which was highly similar to the theoretical genome difference between isolines of similar to 0.39%. Using wheat-rice synteny, both ELPs and SFPs mainly clustered on long arms of rice chromosomes four and seven, which are syntenous to wheat chromosomes 2L (Yr5 locus) and 2S, respectively. The strong physical correlation between the two types of polymorphism indicated that the ELPs may be regulated by cis-acting DNA polymorphisms. Twenty SFPs homologous to rice 4L were used to develop additional genetic markers for Yr5. Physical mapping of the probe sets containing SFPs to wheat chromosomes identified nine on the target chromosome 2BL, thus wheat-rice synteny greatly enhanced the selection of SFPs that were located on the desired wheat chromosome. Of these nine, four were converted into polymorphic cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers between Yr5 and yr5 isolines, and one was mapped within 5.3 cM of the Yr5 locus. This study represents the first array-based polymorphism survey in near-isogenic genotypes, and the results are applied to an agriculturally important trait.

AB One hundred and sixty-four accessions representing Czech and Slovak pea (Pisum sativum L.) varieties bred over the last 50 years were evaluated for genetic diversity using morphological, simple sequence repeat (SSR) and retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) markers. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values of 10 SSR loci and 31 RBIP markers were on average high at 0.89 and 0.73, respectively. The silhouette method after the Ward clustering produced the most probable cluster estimate, identifying nine clusters from molecular data and five to seven clusters from morphological characters. Principal component analysis of nine qualitative and eight quantitative morphological parameters explain over 90 and 93% of total variability, respectively, in the first three axes. Multidimensional scaling of molecular data revealed a continuous structure for the set. To enable integration and evaluation of all data types, a Bayesian method for clustering was applied. Three clusters identified using morphology data, with clear separation of fodder, dry seed and afila types, were resolved by DNA data into 17, 12 and five sub-clusters, respectively. A core collection of 34 samples was derived from the complete collection by BAPS Bayesian analysis. Values for average gene diversity and allelic richness for molecular marker loci and diversity indexes of phenotypic data were found to be similar between the two collections, showing that this is a useful approach for representative core selection.

AB Two eyespot resistance genes (Pch1 and Pch2) have been characterised in wheat. The potent resistance gene Pch1, transferred from Aegilops ventricosa, is located on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 7D (7DL). Pch2 derives from the variety Cappelle Desprez and is located at the distal end of chromosome 7AL. The RFLP marker Xpsr121 and the endopeptidase isozyme allele Ep-D1b, are very closely linked to Pch1, probably due to reduced recombination in the region of the introgressed A. ventricosa segment. Pch2 is less closely linked to these markers but is thought to be closer to Xpsr121 than to Ep-A1b. In the present study simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were integrated into the genetic map of a single chromosome (7D) recombinant (RVPM) population segregating for Pch1. Sequence-tagged-site (STS)-based assays were developed for Xpsp121 and a 7DL wheat EST containing a SSR. SSR markers Xwmc14 and Xbarc97 and the Xpsr121-derived marker co-segregated with Pch1 in the RVPM population. A single chromosome (7A) recombinant population segregating for Pch2 was screened for eyespot resistance and mapped using SSRs. QTL interval mapping closely associated Pch2 with the SSR marker Xwmc525.

AB Triticum monococcum accession TA2026 showed resistance to wheat powdery mildew. To identify the resistance gene and transfer it to common wheat, genetic analysis and molecular mapping were conducted using an F(2) population and derived F(3) families from the cross of TA2026 x M389. The results indicated that TA2026 possessed a recessive powdery mildew resistance gene. This gene was mapped to the terminal portion of chromosome 5A(m)L and flanked by SSR marker loci Xcfd39 and Xgwm126. Eight RFLP markers previously mapped to the terminal chromosome 5A(m)L were converted into STS markers. Three loci, detected by MAG1491, MAG1493 and MAG1494, the STS markers derived from RFLP probes CDO1312, PSR164 and PSR1201, respectively, were linked to this resistance gene with Xmag1493 only 0.9 cM apart from it. In addition, the STS marker MAG2170 developed from the tentative consensus wheat cDNA encoding the Mlo-like protein identified a locus co-segregating with Xmag1493. This is the first recessive powdery mildew resistance gene identified on chromosome 5A(m), and is temporarily designated pm2026. We have successfully transferred it to a tetraploid background, and this resistance stock will now be used as the bridge parent for its transfer to common wheat.

AB An F(1) derived doubled haploid (DH) population of 402 lines from the adapted spring wheat cross Superb (high yielding)/BW278 (low yielding) was developed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with yield and yield components. A subset of the population (186 lines) was evaluated in replicated field trials in 2001 and 2002 at six locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada. Agronomic parameters, grain yield and yield components including 1,000 grain weight, harvest index, average seed weight spike(-1), seed number spike(-1) and spikes number m(-2) were measured. A genetic map was constructed with 268 microsatellite marker loci and included two morphological genes, reduced plant height, Rht-B1b, and the presence/absence of awns, B1. Composite interval mapping was conducted to estimate the location and effect of QTL associated with the evaluated traits. A total of 53 QTL were identified on 12 chromosomes for the 9 evaluated traits with the coefficient of determination ranging from 0.03 to 0.21 of the total variation. The increase in yield and yield components ranged from 4.5 to 17.1% over the population mean. The five grain yield QTL were detected on chromosomes 1A, 2D, 3B, and 5A and showed a combined increase of 34.4%, over the population mean. The alleles from Superb were associated with increased yield for four of the five QTL. This study identified potential chromosome segments for use in marker-assisted selection to improve yield and yield components in spring wheat.

AB The ability to target marker proteins to specific subcellular compartments is a powerful research tool to study the structure and development of organelles. Here transit sequences from nuclear-encoded, plastid proteins, namely rice FtsZ, maize non-photosynthetic ferredoxin III (FdIII) and the small subunit of RubisCO were used to target a modified synthetic GFP (S65G, S72A) to plastids. The localisations of the fusion proteins expressed in transgenic wheat plants and under the control of the rice actin promoter were compared to an untargeted GFP control. GFP fluorescence was localised to non-green plastids in pollen, roots and seed endosperm and detected in isolated leaf chloroplasts using a GFP-specific antibody. Transit peptides appeared to influence the relative fluorescence intensities of plastids in different tissues. This is consistent with differential targeting and/or turnover of GFP fusion proteins in different plastid types. Replacement of GFP sequences with alternative coding regions enables immediate applications of our vectors for academic research and commercial applications.

ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; GRAIN COLOR; HARD WHITE; MAP; FLOUR
AB The establishment of hard white wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a viable alternative for growers has been impeded by several factors, one of which is that new hard white wheat cultivars may not be competitive with hard red cultivars. This is due to the fact that most breeding programs devote more resources to hard red wheat, and that the genetics of kernel color makes rapid conversion of red to white kernel color problematic. Three homoeologous loci control kernel color, with red being dominant. A single red allele is sufficient to cause the kernel to be classified as red. A rapid conversion of red-seeded genotypes to white-seeded types would be facilitated by the use of molecular markers to help select for the recessive alleles for white color. In this experiment, we developed three populations that were segregating at only one of each of three respective color loci, being homozygous recessive at the other two. F-2 plants or recombinant inbred lines were assayed for kernel color and screened with a series of microsatellite markers. Linked microsatellite markers were identified for all loci. A validation experiment was established with a population of 1786 F2 plants from a cross between a red-seeded line and white-seeded line. The markers were 100% diagnostic for the white-seeded phenotype in this population. Thus, the markers will find utility in backcrossing programs to convert red-seeded wheat to white.

AB Russian wheat aphid (RWA, Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov) infestations reduce grain yield and quality and have caused more than $1 billion in losses for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the western United States since 1986. Our objective was to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring resistance to RWA feeding damage in the germplasm line STARS-9301B via polymerase chain reaction-based marker assays of 191 F-2-derived F-3 families from the cross 'Morex'/STARS-9301B. Morex is a susceptible six-rowed malting barley. STARS-9301B is a selection from RWA-resistant Afghanistan introduction PI366450. Replicated seedling reactions to RWA infestations were used to phenotype each family based on a 1 to 9 visual rating of chlorosis. A total of 107 molecular markers was used to construct a linkage map. Quantitative trait loci analysis identified two major QTLs for resistance. The QTL on the short arm of chromosome 1H was associated with B-hordein and explained 26% of the variation for RWA reaction. A QTL on chromosome 3H associated with EBmac0541 explained 38% of the variation. A minor QTL on chromosome 2H was associated with marker GBM1523 and explained 6% of the variation. A combined analysis indicated that the marker-QTL associations explained 59% of the phenotypic variation for RWA resistance. These markers linked with QTLs will be valuable in breeding for RWA resistance. Pyramiding the genes from STARS-9301B with genes from other sources will be helpful for long-term protection against RWA in barley.

AB Wheat production is threatened by a constantly changing population of pathogen species and races. Given the rapid ability of many pathogens to overcome genetic resistance, the identification and practical implementation of new sources of resistance is essential. Landraces and wild relatives of wheat have played an important role as genetic resources for the improvement of disease resistance. The use of molecular approaches, particularly molecular markers, has allowed better characterization of the genetic diversity in wheat germplasm. In addition, the molecular cloning of major resistance (R) genes has recently been achieved in the large, polyploid wheat genome. For the first time this allows the study and analysis of the genetic variability of wheat R loci at the molecular level and therefore, to screen for allelic variation at such loci in the gene pool. Thus, strategies such as allele mining and ecotilling are now possible for characterization of wheat disease resistance. Here, we discuss the approaches, resources and potential tools to characterize and utilize the naturally occurring resistance diversity in wheat. We also report a first step in allele mining, where we characterize the occurrence of known resistance alleles at the wheat Pm3 powdery mildew resistance locus in a set of 1,320 landraces assembled on the basis of eco-geographical criteria. From known Pm3 R alleles, only Pm3b was frequently identified (3% of the tested accessions). In the same set of landraces, we found a high frequency of a Pm3 haplotype carrying a susceptible allele of Pm3. This analysis allowed the identification of a set of resistant lines where new potentially functional alleles would be present. Newly identified resistance alleles will enrich the genetic basis of resistance in breeding programmes and contribute to wheat improvement.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) globally. High-temperature adult-plant resistance (HTAPR) and slow-rusting have great potential for sustainable management of the disease. The wheat cultivars Luke and Aquileja have been previously reported to possess HTAPR and slow-rusting to stripe rust, respectively. Aquileja displayed less number of stripes per unit leaf area than Luke, while Luke showed lower infection type than Aquileja at adult-plant stages of growth under high-temperature conditions. The objectives of this study were to confirm the resistances and to map the resistance genes in Luke and Aquileja. Luke was crossed with Aquileja, and 326 of the F-2 plants were genotyped using 282 microsatellite primer pairs. These F-2 plants and their derived F-3 families were evaluated for resistance to stripe rust by inoculation in the fields and greenhouses of high- and low-temperatures. Infection type was recorded for both seedlings and adult plants, and stripe number was recorded for adult plants only. Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified, on the short arm of chromosome 2B, to be significantly associated with infection type at adult-plant stages in the fields and in the high-temperature greenhouse. The locus distal to centromere, referred to as QYrlu.cau-2BS1, and the locus proximal to centromere, referred to as QYrlu.cau-2BS2, were separated by a genetic distance of about 23 cM. QYrlu.cau-2BS1 was flanked by the microsatellite markers Xwmc154 and Xgwm148, and QYrlu.cau-2BS2 was flanked by Xgwm148 and Xabrc167. QYrlu.cau-2BS1 and QYrlu.cau-2BS2 explained up to 36.6 and 41.5% of the phenotypic variation of infection type, respectively, and up to 78.1% collectively. No significant interaction between the two loci was detected. Another QTL, referred to as QYraq.cau-2BL, was detected on the long arm of chromosome 2B to be significantly associated with stripe number. QYraq.cau-2BL was flanked by the microsatellite markers Xwmc175 and Xwmc332, and it explained up to 61.5% of the phenotypic variation of stripe number. It is possible that these three QTL are previously un-mapped loci for resistance to stripe rust.

AB The CIMMYT-developed spring wheat 'Brambling' has a high level of adult-plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. Our objectives were to determine the genetic basis of resistance in seedlings and adult plants and the magnitude of genotype x environment effects on the expression of APR. Brambling was crossed with spring wheat 'Jupateco 73S' that is highly susceptible to current predominant P. triticina races in Mexico and the United States. The F-1, F-2:3, F-4:5, F-4:6, and F-5:7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were evaluated under artificial field epidemics in Mexico and St. Paul, MN, The RILs also were tested with five races of P. triticina in greenhouse seedling experiments. A DNA marker was used to postulate the presence of slow-rusting gene Lr34 in the RILs. F, data suggested strong dominant effect of the APR genes in Brambling. The proportion of homozygous susceptible lines in each generation indicated the presence of three effective resistance genes in adult plants of Brambling in tests in Mexico and three or four genes in tests in St. Paul. The RILs segregated for seedling genes Lr14a and Lr23 and adult-plant slow-rusting gene Lr34 derived from Brambling and Lr17a from Jupateco 73S. Gene Lr23 conditioned APR to P. triticina races present in the St. Paul nursery and accounted for the additional effective gene at this location. Expression of APR was influenced by the environment in the RILs, even though Brambling displayed a consistent response, indicating that stability of APR can be achieved by combinations of slow-rusting resistance genes.

TI Genomic Analysis of the Snn1 Locus on Wheat Chromosome Arm 1BS and the
   Identification of Candidate Genes
SO PLANT GENOME
LA English
DT Article
AB The pathogen Stagonospora nodorum produces multiple host-selective toxins (HSTs) that induce cell death and necrosis in sensitive wheat (Triticum sp.) genotypes. One such HST is SnTox1, which interacts with the host gene Snn1 on wheat chromosome arm 1BS to cause necrosis leading to disease susceptibility. Toward the positional cloning of Snn1, we developed saturated and high-resolution maps of the Snn1 locus and evaluated colinearity of the region with rice (Oryza sativa L.). An F-2 population of 120 individuals derived from 'Chinese Spring' (CS) and the CS-T. dicoccoides chromosome 1B disomic substitution line was used to map 54 markers consisting of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence repeats, and bin mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Colinearity between wheat 1BS and rice was determined by aligning EST and RFLP probe sequences to the rice genome. Overall, colinearity was poorly conserved due to numerous complex chromosomal rearrangements, and of 48 wheat EST-RFLP sequences mapped, 30 had significant similarity to sequences on nine different rice chromosomes. However, 12 of the wheat sequences had similarity to sequences on rice chromosome 5 and were in a colinear arrangement with only a few exceptions, including an inversion of the markers flanking Snn1. High-resolution mapping of the Snn1 locus in 8510 gametes delineated the gene to a 0.46-cM interval. Two EST-derived markers that cosegregated with Snn1 were found to share homology to nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat-like genes and are considered potential candidates for Snn1.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a hexaploid species with a large and complex genome. A reference genetic marker map, namely the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) map, has been constructed with the recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross involving a synthetic line. But it is not sufficient for a full understanding of the wheat genome under artificial selection without comparing it with intervarietal maps. Using an intervarietal mapping population derived by crossing Nanda2419 and Wangshuibai, we constructed a high-density genetic map of wheat. The total map length was 4,223.1 cM, comprising 887 loci, 345 of which were detected by markers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two-thirds of the high marker density blocks were present in interstitial and telomeric regions. The map covered, mostly with the EST-derived markers, approximately 158 cM of telomeric regions absent in the ITMI map. The regions of low marker density were largely conserved among cultivars and between homoeologous subgenomes. The loci showing skewed segregation displayed a clustered distribution along chromosomes and some of the segregation distortion regions (SDR) are conserved in different mapping populations. This map enriched with EST-derived markers is important for structure and function analysis of wheat genome as well as in wheat gene mapping, cloning, and breeding programs.

AB Carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) and leaf water-use efficiency vary in concert in C3 plants, making delta(13)C useful as a proxy for plant water-use efficiency. A QTL for delta(13)C was detected in the Solanum pennellii chromosome fragment of IL5-4, an introgression line with S. lycopersicum cv. M82 background. M82 and IL 5-4 were crossed, and RFLP markers in the target region converted to PCR-based markers. Forty-one recombinants with an introgression fragment ranging in length from 1.1 to 11.4 cM were identified by marker assisted selection (MAS) among approximately 2000 F2 plants. A total of 29 markers were mapped within the introgression fragment unique to IL5-4. These markers divided the about 9 cM target region into nine intervals. A dominant QTL for delta(13)C, designated QWUE5.1 that explained 25.6% of the total phenotypic variance was mapped to an interval about 2.2 cM long. Twenty-one plants with a S. pennellii chromosome fragment shortened to a length of 2.0-9.1 cM by a second recombination event were generated by MAS of 1,125 F4 plants. Two near isogenic lines with high delta(13)C (small negative value) and carrying QWUE5.1 on the shortest introgression fragments (about 7.0 cM) were identified. The markers and genetic stocks developed are valuable for cloning the gene underlying QWUE5.1, MAS of QWUE5.1, and fine-mapping genes/QTL located in this region.

AB Background: The recent rapid accumulation of sequence resources of various crop species ensures an improvement in the genetics approach, including quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis as well as the holistic population analysis and association mapping of natural variations. Because the tribe Triticeae includes important cereals such as wheat and barley, integration of information on the genetic markers in these crops should effectively accelerate map-based genetic studies on Triticeae species and lead to the discovery of key loci involved in plant productivity, which can contribute to sustainable food production. Therefore, informatics applications and a semantic knowledgebase of genome-wide markers are required for the integration of information on and further development of genetic markers in wheat and barley in order to advance conventional marker-assisted genetic analyses and population genomics of Triticeae species.
   Description: The Triticeae mapped expressed sequence tag (EST) database (TriMEDB) provides information, along with various annotations, regarding mapped cDNA markers that are related to barley and their homologues in wheat. The current version of TriMEDB provides map-location data for barley and wheat ESTs that were retrieved from 3 published barley linkage maps (the barley single nucleotide polymorphism database of the Scottish Crop Research Institute, the barley transcript map of Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, and HarvEST barley ver. 1.63) and 1 diploid wheat map. These data were imported to CMap to allow the visualization of the map positions of the ESTs and interrelationships of these ESTs with public gene models and representative cDNA sequences. The retrieved cDNA sequences corresponding to each EST marker were assigned to the rice genome to predict an exon-intron structure. Furthermore, to generate a unique set of EST markers in Triticeae plants among the public domain, 3472 markers were assembled to form 2737 unique marker groups as contigs. These contigs were applied for pairwise comparison among linkage maps obtained from different EST map resources.
   Conclusion: TriMEDB provides information regarding transcribed genetic markers and functions as a semantic knowledgebase offering an informatics facility for the acceleration of QTL analysis and for population genetics studies of Triticeae.

AB Background: Flow cytometry facilitates sorting of single chromosomes and chromosome arms which can be used for targeted genome analysis. However, the recovery of microgram amounts of DNA needed for some assays requires sorting of millions of chromosomes which is laborious and time consuming. Yet, many genomic applications such as development of genetic maps or physical mapping do not require large DNA fragments. In such cases time-consuming de novo sorting can be minimized by utilizing whole-genome amplification.
   Results: Here we report a protocol optimized in barley including amplification of DNA from only ten thousand chromosomes, which can be isolated in less than one hour. Flow-sorted chromosomes were treated with proteinase K and amplified using Phi29 multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Overnight amplification in a 20-microlitre reaction produced 3.7-5.7 micrograms DNA with a majority of products between 5 and 30 kb. To determine the purity of sorted fractions and potential amplification bias we used quantitative PCR for specific genes on each chromosome. To extend the analysis to a whole genome level we performed an oligonucleotide pool assay (OPA) for interrogation of 1524 loci, of which 1153 loci had known genetic map positions. Analysis of unamplified genomic DNA of barley cv. Akcent using this OPA resulted in 1426 markers with present calls. Comparison with three replicates of amplified genomic DNA revealed > 99% concordance. DNA samples from amplified chromosome 1H and a fraction containing chromosomes 2H-7H were examined. In addition to loci with known map positions, 349 loci with unknown map positions were included. Based on this analysis 40 new loci were mapped to 1H.
   Conclusion: The results indicate a significant potential of using this approach for physical mapping. Moreover, the study showed that multiple displacement amplification of flown sorted chromosomes is highly efficient and representative which considerably expands the potential of chromosome flow sorting in plant genomics.

AB A quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach was applied to dissect the genetic control of the common wheat seedling response to osmotic stress. A set of 114 recombinant inbred lines was subjected to osmotic stress from the onset of germination to the 8(th) day of seedling development, induced by the presence of 12 % polyethylene glycol. Root, coleoptile and shoot length, and root/shoot length ratio were compared under stress and control conditions. In all, 35 QTL mapping to ten chromosomes, were identified. Sixteen QTL were detected in controls, 17 under stressed conditions, and two tolerance index QTL were determined. The majority of the QTL were not stress-specific. In regions on five chromosome arms (1AS, 1BL, 2DS, 5BL and 6BL) the QTL identified under stress co-mapped with QTL affecting the same trait in controls, and these were classified as seedling vigour QTL, in addition to those expressed in controls. Tolerance-related QTL were detected on four chromosome arms. A broad region on chromosome 1AL, including five QTL, with a major impact of the gene Glu-A1 (LOD 3.93) and marker locus Xksuh9d (LOD 2.91), positively affected root length under stress and tolerance index for root length, respectively. A major QTL (LOD 3.60), associated with marker locus Xcdo456a (distal part of chromosome arm 2BS) determined a tolerance index for shoot length. Three minor QTL (LOD < 3.0) for root length and root/shoot length ratio under osmotic stress were identified in the distal parts of chromosome arms 6DL (marker locus Xksud27a) and 7DL (marker locus Xksue3b). Selecting for the favourable alleles at marker loci associated with the detected QTL for growth traits may represent an efficient approach to enhance the plants' ability to maintain the growth of roots, coleoptile and shoots in drought-prone soils at the critical early developmental stages.

AB The set of 44 near-isogenic lines of spring wheat cv. Thatcher and wheat genotypes known to carry specific leaf rust resistance genes were included in the present study for the preliminary validation of twelve STS and SCAR markers linked to leaf rust resistance genes Lr9, Lr19, Lr20, Lr21, Lr24, Lr25, Lr26, Lr28, Lr29, Lr37. Seven Lr genes were specifically tagged by STS and SCAR markers. The presence of genes Lr9, Lr19, Lr20, Lr24, Lr28, Lr29, Lr37 in the tested plant materials was confirmed by a unique amplification of markers SCS5(550), SCS265(512) and SCS253(736), STS638, SCS73(719), SCS421(570), IPY10 and Lr29F24/R24, cs1Vrga13, PSI OWL, respectively. Evaluation of the repeatability and the reliability of selected markers (pTAG621 for Lr1, STS683 for Lr20, D14L for Lr21, Lr25F20/R19 for Lr25, Lr29F24/R24, IPY 10 for Lr29, cs1Vrga13 for Lr37 and PS10R/L for Lr47) across four European laboratories and PCR conditions demonstrated the usability of STS638, Lr29F24/R24, IPY 10, cs1Vrga13 and PS10R/L markers in marker-assisted selection. STS markers pTAG621 for gene Lr1, D14L for gene Lr21, Lr25F20/R19 for gene Lr25 were found to be unsuitable for effective screening of large segregating populations in breeding programs.

AB PCR assays specific for the GA insensitive dwarfing genes (alleles) Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b were employed to study a series of additional alleles of Rht-B1 and Rht-D1. The amplification profiles of Rht-B1b and Rht-Bld were not distinguishable from one another, whereas lines carrying Rht-B1c, Rht-B1e and Rht-B1f amplified a product analogous to that of the wild type. At the 4D locus, no discrimination was possible between Rht-D1b, Rht-D1c and Rht-D1d. As a result, the utilisation of these PCR assays is limited. Examples of the analysis of germplasm and spontaneous occurring off-types are presented.

AB The out-crossing indices (out-crossing rate, rate of plants on which out-crossing had occurred, and out-crossing intensity) in F-2 plants of soft winter wheat derived from the reciprocal crossing B-16 x Odesskaya Krasnokolosaya are analyzed using storage proteins as genetic markers. The out-crossing index is substantially dependent on the growing conditions. The out-crossing rate in a reciprocal population amounted to 0.35% (Odessa, 2000) and 5.11% (Kiev, 2004). The greatest out-crossing indices are observed in homozygotes for the presence of the rye 1BL/1RS translocation. The value of the out-crossing index in heterozygotes for the presence of this translocation is intermediate. Differences in the out-crossing index between plant populations derived from direct and reciprocal crossings are found. The multidirectionality of these differences with respect to out-crossing rate and the percentage of plants with out-crossing, on the one hand, and the out-crossing intensity, on the other hand, is noted.

AB For the first time in the history of black pepper cultivation, a partly fertile interspecific hybrid having partial resistance to the dreaded disease Phytophthora foot rot was developed through hybridizing Piper nigrum with the wild species Piper colubrinnum. Hybridity of interspecific progenies was established through morphology, anatomy, cytology, and molecular studies. The hybrid, whose chromosome number is 2n = 39, is a triploid hybrid between a tetraploid and diploid species. The hybrid designated as Culture P5PC-1 exhibited distinct anatomical and morphological feature with a large number of long spikes with reduced setting percentage. The RAPD primers OPE 07 and OPG 08 were identified as hybrid specific molecular markers. Functional evaluation revealed partial introgression of genes-responsible for Phytophthora foot rot resistance-into the hybrid. This hybrid is considered as a successful breakthrough for introgression of resistance to the cultivated species Piper nigrum from the wild species Piper colubrinnum.

AB A novel 1Dx type high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) associated with good bread-making quality was identified in the bread wheat line W958. This glutenin subunit was designated as 1Dx5' here for the same electrophoretic mobility as the traditional one 1Dx5 in the sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. In this work, the 5' flanking region, N-terminal as well as partial central repetitive domain of this allele was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of 1Dx5' with that of 1Dx5 and 1Dx2 showed the main difference being the substitution of one cysteine residue located in the central repetitive domain of 1Dx5 with serine residue in 1Dx5' or an additional proline being inserted at the N-terminal of 1Dx5' compared with 1Dx2. Allelic specific-polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) molecular markers discriminating the alleles of Glu-D1 locus were designed and applied to two F(2) segregation populations. Meanwhile, the dough properties of the F(2) population were measured and analyzed, showing that the 1Dx5' subunit is as good as 1Dx5 and superior than 1Dx2 in terms of dough property. The result illustrated that the inter-chain hydrogen bonds formed between the subunit repetitive domains rather than the cysteine may play the main role in bread making quality. Notably, the novel 1Dx5' have a great portion in the F(2) segregation population, suggesting the phenomenon of segregation distortion which could facilitate the introduction of 1Dx5' into the wheat breeding program.

AB To better understand the evolution of allopolyploids, 4 different combinations between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.) including 12 F(1) hybrids and 12 derived amphiploids were analyzed and compared with their direct parental plants by PCR analysis using 150 wheat SSR (single sequence repeat) markers and by FISH analysis using a rye-specific repetitive sequence (pSc200) as a probe. Nine SSR markers amplified rye-specific fragments whose sizes ranged from 471 bp to 1089 bp. These fragments contain regulatory elements and (or) promoters. Some of these fragments were amplified from all 24 progenies, while others were amplified from a subset of the progenies. The disappearance of rye-specific fragments from some progenies was caused by sequence elimination or DNA modification. Marker Xgwm320 amplified a new fragment (403 bp), a rye-specific tandem repeat, from some of the progenies. Twenty-eight SSR markers displayed microsatellite variation in progenies derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'Jinzhou-heimai', but none of the 150 SSR markers displayed microsatellite variation in the progenies derived from the other three combinations. FISH signals of pSc200 were eliminated from one telomere/subtelomere of 4 chromosomes of 'Kustro' during allopolyploidization and expanded in amphiploids derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'AR106BONE'. Thus, allopolyploidization in wheat-rye can be accompanied by rapid variation of tandem repeats, regulatory elements, and promoter regions. The alterations of repetitive sequence pSc200 indicate coordination between the constituent genomes of the newly formed amphiploids. Different genetic backgrounds of parents appear to affect genome changes during allopolyploidization.

AB Seed dormancy is an important factor regulating preharvest sprouting (PHS) but is a complex trait for genetic analysis. We previously identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling seed dormancy on the long arm of chromosome 4A (4AL) in common wheat. To transfer the QTL from the dormant lines 'OS21-5' and 'Leader' into the Japanese elite variety 'Haruyokoi', which has an insufficient level of seed dormancy, backcrossing was carried out through marker-assisted selection (MAS) using PCR-based codominant markers. Nineteen BC(5)F(2) plants with homozygous alleles of 'OS21-5' or 'Haruyokoi' were developed and evaluated for seed dormancy under greenhouse conditions. The seeds harvested from plants with 'OS21-5' alleles showed a clearly high level of dormancy compared with seeds from plants with 'Haruyokoi' alleles. Additionally, the dormancy phenotype of BC(3)F(3) seeds harvested from 128 BC(3)F(2) plants with homozygous alleles of 'Leader' or 'Haruyokoi' showed a clear difference between these alleles. The QTL on 4AL confers a major gene, Phs1, which was mapped within a 2.6 cM region. The backcrossed lines developed in this study can be important sources for improving PHS resistance in Japanese wheat and for analyzing the mechanism of seed dormancy. MAS was useful for the development of near-isogenic lines in this complex trait, to facilitate the molecular dissection of genetic factors.

AB Chronic mechanical compression of the spinal cord causes neural tissue damage, including loss of anterior horn cells around the level of injury. Exogenous delivery of neurotrophins to neuronal cells could provide neuro-protection to a spinal cord subjected to mechanical injury. We investigated the efficacy of retrograde gene delivery of adenoviral vector (AdV) carrying neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene into twy (twy/twy) mouse spinal cord anterior horn neurons with chronic and progressive mechanical compression at C1-C2 level. AdV-NT-3 was used for retrograde delivery via the sternomastoid muscle to the cervical spinal accessory motoneurons in 16-week-old adult twy mice with relatively mild spinal cord compression. Four weeks after the AdV-NT-3 or AdV-beta-galactosidase cDNA (LacZ) as a marker gene injection, the compressed cervical spinal cord was examined histologically, immunohistologically, and by immunoblot analysis. Immunoreactivity to NT-3 was significantly enhanced in the AdV-NT-3-injected twy mice compared with the AdV-LacZ-injected mice. The numbers of anterior horn neurons of Nissl-, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-, and trkC-stained and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)-labeled neurons at the spinal cord level with maximum compression were significantly higher in AdV-NT-3-transfected than in AdV-LacZ-transfected twy mice. Retrograde NT-3 gene transfer to twy mouse anterior horn neurons increased neurite axonal length and arborization of WGA-HRP-labeled neurons. Our results suggest that targeted retrograde NT-3 gene delivery is feasible in the intact animal and that it enhances neuronal survival even under chronic mechanical compression of the spinal cord.

AB Study of the structure of high molecular weight (Mr) glutenin subunits and their interaction has been limited by the difficulty of isolating single subunits in large amounts from the complex mixture of gluten wheat endosperm. One way to overcome this problem is the expression of high Mr glutenin subunits in heterologous systems. These systems have the additional advantages that, specific gene modifications can be made and the new gene constructs can quickly be expressed. HMW glutenin gene subunits, associated with better dough quality, were isolated from wheat (T. aestivum var. PBW343) using allele specific primers (AS-PCR) designed on allelic gene sequences. Three glutenin genes 1Ax1, Dx5 and Dy10 of sizes 1.8, 2.0 and 1.47 kb were cloned and sequenced. Probable secondary structure of HMW glutenin protein was predicted using online ExPASy server. HMW glu Dx5 and Dy10 gave significant similarity (more than 90%) to the available database but, 1Ax1 didn't show significant similarity. Glutenin genes were further subcloned in expression vector pCAMBIA-1304 driven by CaMV35S promoter and their expression was observed in Escherichia coli. The transcription was confirmed by Reverse transcriptase PCR (Rt-PCR) and sequencing. The sequences of HMW glu genes showed 100% homology with cloned HMW glutenin genes. Although initial western blotting using polyclonal antibodies against glutenin protein has strongly indicated its expression at the translation level, it is needed to be further confirmed through purification and sequencing of proteins.

AB The stem rust resistance gene Sr24 is effective against most races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, including race TTKS (syn. Ug99), and is used widely in commercial wheat cultivars worldwide. In 2006, susceptible infection responses were observed on wheat lines and cultivars carrying Sr24 in a field stem rust screening nursery at Njoro, Kenya. We derived 28 single-pustule isolates from stem rust samples collected from the 2006 Njoro nursery. The isolates were evaluated for virulence on 16 North American stem rust differential lines; on wheat lines carrying Sr24, Sr31, Sr38, and SrMcN; and on a wheat cultivar with a combination of Sr24 and Sr31. All isolates were identified as race TTKS with additional virulence on Sr31 and Sr38. These isolates were divided into two groups: group A (seven isolates and the two control isolates), producing a low infection type, and group B (21 isolates), producing a high infection type on Sr24, respectively. Isolates of group B represented a new variant of race TTKS with virulence to Sr24. Eighteen simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to examine the genetic relationship between these two groups of isolates in race TTKS and five North American races (MCCF, QCCQ, RCRS, RTHS, and TPMK) that are representative of distinct lineage groups. All isolates of race TTKS shared an identical SSR genotype and were clearly different from North American races. The virulence and SSR data indicated that the new variant of race TTKS with Sr24 virulence likely has arisen via mutation within the TTKS genetic lineage. We propose to revise the North American stem rust nomenclature system by the addition of four genes (Sr24, Sr31, Sr38, and SrMcN) as the fifth set. This revision recognizes the virulence on Sr31 and differentiates isolates within race TTKS into two separate races: TTKSK and TTKST, with avirulence and virulence on Sr24, respectively. The occurrence of race TTKST with combined virulence on Sr24 and Sr31 has substantially increased the vulnerability of wheat to stem rust worldwide.

AB Oligonucleotide microarrays corresponding to over 16,000 genes were used to analyze changes in transcript accumulation in root tips of the Al-sensitive Medicago truncatula cultivar Jemalong genotype A17 in response to Al treatment. Out of 2,782 genes with significant changes in transcript accumulation, 324 genes were up-regulated and 267 genes were down-regulated at least twofold by Al. Up-regulated genes were enriched in transcripts involved in cell-wall modification and abiotic and biotic stress responses while down-regulated genes were enriched in transcripts involved in primary metabolism, secondary metabolism, protein synthesis and processing, and the cell cycle. Known markers of Al-induced gene expression including genes associated with oxidative stress and cell wall stiffening were differentially regulated in this study. Transcript profiling identified novel genes associated with processes involved in Al toxicity including cell wall modification, cell cycle arrest and ethylene production. Novel genes potentially associated with Al resistance and tolerance in M. truncatula including organic acid transporters, cell wall loosening enzymes, Ca(2+) homeostasis maintaining genes, and Al-binding were also identified. In addition, expression analysis of nine genes in the mature regions of the root revealed that Al-induced gene expression in these regions may play a role in Al tolerance. Finally, interfering RNA-induced silencing of two Al-induced genes, pectin acetylesterase and annexin, in A17 hairy roots slightly increased the sensitivity of A17 to Al suggesting that these genes may play a role in Al resistance.

AB Non-gel-based quantitative proteomics technology was used to profile protein expression differences when Fusarium graminearum was induced to produce trichothecenes in vitro. As F. graminearum synthesizes and secretes trichothecenes early in the cereal host invasion process, we hypothesized that proteins contributing to infection would also be induced under conditions favouring mycotoxin synthesis. Protein samples were extracted from three biological replicates of a time course study and subjected to iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) analysis. Statistical analysis of a filtered dataset of 435 proteins revealed 130 F. graminearum proteins that exhibited significant changes in expression, of which 72 were upregulated relative to their level at the initial phase of the time course. There was good agreement between upregulated proteins identified by 2-D PAGE/MS/MS and iTRAQ. RT-PCR and northern hybridization confirmed that genes encoding proteins which were upregulated based on iTRAQ were also transcriptionally active under mycotoxin producing conditions. Numerous candidate pathogenicity proteins were identified using this technique. These will provide leads in the search for mechanisms and markers of host invasion and novel antifungal targets.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint for wheat production in acid soils worldwide. Chinese landrace FSW demonstrates a high level of Al resistance. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between FSW and an Al-sensitive Chinese line, ND35, using single seed descent, to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Al resistance. Wheat reaction to Al stress was measured by net root growth (NRG) in a nutrient solution culture containing Al(3+) and hematoxylin staining score (HSS) of root after Al stress. After 1,437 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were screened using bulk segregant analysis, three QTLs were identified to control Al resistance in FSW. One major QTL (Qalt.pser-4DL) was mapped on chromosome 4DL that co-segregated with Xups4, a marker for the promoter of the Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1) gene. The other two QTLs (Qalt.pser-3BL, Qalt.pser-2A) were located on chromosomes 3BL and 2A, respectively. Together, the three QTLs accounted for up to 81.9% of the phenotypic variation for HSS and 78.3% of the variation for NRG. The physical positions of flanking markers for Qalt.pser-4DL and Qalt.pser-3BL were determined by analyzing these markers in corresponding nulli-tetrasomic, ditelosomic, and 3BL deletion lines of Chinese Spring. Qalt.pser-3BL is a novel QTL with a major effect on Al resistance discovered in this study. The two major QTLs on 4DL and 3BL demonstrated an additive effect. The SSR markers closely linked to the QTLs have potential to be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to improve Al resistance of wheat cultivars in breeding programs.

AB Background: Microsatellite (simple sequence repeat - SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are two types of important genetic markers useful in genetic mapping and genotyping. Often, large-scale genomic research projects require high-throughput computer-assisted primer design. Numerous such web-based or standard-alone programs for PCR primer design are available but vary in quality and functionality. In particular, most programs lack batch primer design capability. Such a high-throughput software tool for designing SSR flanking primers and SNP genotyping primers is increasingly demanded.
   Results: A new web primer design program, BatchPrimer3, is developed based on Primer3. BatchPrimer3 adopted the Primer3 core program as a major primer design engine to choose the best primer pairs. A new score-based primer picking module is incorporated into BatchPrimer3 and used to pick position-restricted primers. BatchPrimer3 v1.0 implements several types of primer designs including generic primers, SSR primers together with SSR detection, and SNP genotyping primers (including single-base extension primers, allele-specific primers, and tetra-primers for tetra-primer ARMS PCR), as well as DNA sequencing primers. DNA sequences in FASTA format can be batch read into the program. The basic information of input sequences, as a reference of parameter setting of primer design, can be obtained by pre-analysis of sequences. The input sequences can be pre-processed and masked to exclude and/or include specific regions, or set targets for different primer design purposes as in Primer3Web and primer3Plus. A tab-delimited or Excel-formatted primer output also greatly facilitates the subsequent primer-ordering process. Thousands of primers, including wheat conserved intron-flanking primers, wheat genome-specific SNP genotyping primers, and Brachypodium SSR flanking primers in several genome projects have been designed using the program and validated in several laboratories.
   Conclusion: BatchPrimer3 is a comprehensive web primer design program to develop different types of primers in a high-throughput manner. Additional methods of primer design can be easily integrated into future versions of BatchPrimer3. The program with source code and thousands of PCR and sequencing primers designed for wheat and Brachypodium are accessible at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/BatchPrimer3/.

AB Background: Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is one of the most important oil bearing crops in the world. However, genetic improvement of oil palm through conventional breeding is extremely slow and costly, as the breeding cycle can take up to 10 years. This has brought about interest in vegetative propagation of oil palm. Since the introduction of oil palm tissue culture in the 1970s, clonal propagation has proven to be useful, not only in producing uniform planting materials, but also in the development of the genetic engineering programme. Despite considerable progress in improving the tissue culture techniques, the callusing and embryogenesis rates from proliferating callus cultures remain very low. Thus, understanding the gene diversity and expression profiles in oil palm tissue culture is critical in increasing the efficiency of these processes.
   Results: A total of 12 standard cDNA libraries, representing three main developmental stages in oil palm tissue culture, were generated in this study. Random sequencing of clones from these cDNA libraries generated 17,599 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The ESTs were analysed, annotated and assembled to generate 9,584 putative unigenes distributed in 3,268 consensi and 6,316 singletons. These unigenes were assigned putative functions based on similarity and gene ontology annotations. Cluster analysis, which surveyed the relatedness of each library based on the abundance of ESTs in each consensus, revealed that lipid transfer proteins were highly expressed in embryogenic tissues. A glutathione S-transferase was found to be highly expressed in non-embryogenic callus. Further analysis of the unigenes identified 648 non-redundant simple sequence repeats and 211 putative full-length open reading frames.
   Conclusion: This study has provided an overview of genes expressed during oil palm tissue culture. Candidate genes with expression that are modulated during tissue culture were identified. However, in order to confirm whether these genes are suitable as early markers for embryogenesis, the genes need to be tested on earlier stages of tissue culture and a wider range of genotypes. This collection of ESTs is an important resource for genetic and genome analyses of the oil palm, particularly during tissue culture development.

TI A novel resource for genomics of Triticeae: BAC library specific for the

AB Background: Genomics of rye (Secale cereale L.) is impeded by its large nuclear genome (IC similar to 7,900 Mbp) with prevalence of DNA repeats (> 90%). An attractive possibility is to dissect the genome to small parts after flow sorting particular chromosomes and chromosome arms. To test this approach, we have chosen 1RS chromosome arm, which represents only 5.6% of the total rye genome. The 1RS arm is an attractive target as it carries many important genes and because it became part of the wheat gene pool as the IBL. 1RS translocation.
   Results: We demonstrate that it is possible to sort 1RS arm from wheat-rye ditelosomic addition line. Using this approach, we isolated over 10 million of 1RS arms using flow sorting and used their DNA to construct a 1RS-specific BAC library, which comprises 103,680 clones with average insert size of 73 kb. The library comprises two sublibraries constructed using HindIII and EcoRI and provides a deep coverage of about 14-fold of the 1RS arm (442 Mbp). We present preliminary results obtained during positional cloning of the stem rust resistance gene SrR, which confirm a potential of the library to speed up isolation of agronomically important genes by map-based cloning.
   Conclusion: We present a strategy that enables sorting short arms of several chromosomes of rye. Using flow-sorted chromosomes, we have constructed a deep coverage BAC library specific for the short arm of chromosome 1R (1RS). This is the first subgenomic BAC library available for rye and we demonstrate its potential for positional gene cloning. We expect that the library will facilitate development of a physical contig map of 1RS and comparative genomics of the homoeologous chromosome group I of wheat, barley and rye.

AB Background: Inflammation may be a mechanism by which high postprandial insulin and glucose responses increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Objective: We hypothesized that dietary carbohydrates characterized by different postprandial insulin responses may differentially modify cytokine concentrations in plasma and gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue.
   Design: Individuals (n = 47) with the metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a 12-wk diet with oat and wheat bread and potato (high postprandial insulin response) or rye bread and pasta (low postprandial insulin response). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses to the oat and wheat bread meal and to the rye bread meal were determined in 19 individuals before intervention.
   Results: During the 12-wk diet, the change in the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-10 receptor alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue differed between the groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.083, respectively). Moreover, the change in fasting plasma concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-6 differed between the groups (P = 0.020 and P = 0.055, respectively). In the postprandial challenge, the insulin response to the rye bread meal was lower than that to the oat and wheat bread meal (P < 0.001), whereas there were no differences in the mean blood glucose response. In contrast, plasma glucose concentrations decreased more below fasting concentrations 2.5-3 h after the oat and wheat bread meal than after the rye bread meal. A late postprandial rebound of free fatty acids was detected after the oat and wheat bread meal (P = 0.048).
   Conclusions: Long-term intake of cereal foods with differing postprandial insulin responses may be a factor that modulates the inflammatory status in individuals with the metabolic syndrome.

AB The Hardness (Ha) locus contains the Hina, Hinb-1, Hinb-2, and Gsp genes and was shown to be associated with grain hardness and dry matter digestibility (DMD) variation. In this study, 73 spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) accessions selected for DMD variation were assessed for variation in DMD, seed quality, and Hardness (Ha) locus component gene alleles. To determine whether Ha is associated with grain quality traits, we assessed the relationship of the Ha locus in the presence or absence of head type (two or six row) variation. To accomplish this, the barley Ha locus component genes (Hina, Hinb-1, Hinb-2, and Gsp) were sequenced, from each accession and sorted by prevalence. The most common Ha haplotype (HINA, HINB-1, HINB-2 alleles) was present in 42 accessions with the remaining 39 dispersed over 24 haplotypes. Seeds from two-row accessions with the most common Ha haplotype were significantly softer in grain texture (P < 0.001) and had increased starch content (P < 0.001) and DMD (P < 0.05). We used quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure Hina, Hinb-1, Hinb-2, and Gsp expression levels in developing seeds of 19 Ha locus haplotypes. The expression levels of all four genes were positively correlated with DMD. The results indicate that selection for individual Ha locus haplotypes may be useful in modifying seed size, DMD, and starch content in two-row barley.

AB Plant breeding that emphasizes crosses among elite parents in a closed population (advanced cycle breeding) is presumed to decrease genetic diversity. To assess the effect of plant breeding on allelic diversity, we evaluated regional ancestors, parental lines, and cultivar candidates from the University of Minnesota six-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) breeding program between 1958 and 1998 using pedigree information, 70 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and a gene specific marker. Pedigree and SSR allelic diversity indices revealed a decrease in genetic diversity, from an average of 5 89 alleles per locus in the ancestors group to 2.34 alleles per locus in the fourth decade of breeding. A correspondence analysis showed differentiation in the germplasm with time. At specific loci, we detected both reductions and no change in the number of alleles over time. Several marker loci that demonstrated a reduction in number of alleles were associated with major loci for disease resistance or malting quality and were presumably under selection during breeding. Assessment of locus-specific allelic variation across the genome in breeding germplasm should identify both the regions of the genome that should be conserved and the regions of the genome where there are opportunities to introgress new allelic diversity without disrupting desirable gene complexes.

AB The CIMMYT spring wheat Weebill 1 has near-immune levels of adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. To determine the genetic basis of resistance in seedlings and adult plants Weebill 1 was crossed with two susceptible parents Jupateco 73S and 'Thatcher'. Advanced F(4:5), F(4:6), and F(5:7) recombinant inbred lines (RIL) populations from Jupateco 73S/Weebill 1 and BC(1)F(2) populations from Thatcher/Weebill 1 were derived. The F(5:7) RILs and BC(1)F(2) families were tested as seedlings with five races of P. triticina. The F(1) and F(4:5), F(4:6), and F(5:7) RILs of Jupateco 73S/Weebill 1 were evaluated in plots in Mexico and St. Paul. The Jupateco 73S/Weebill 1 RILs and Thatcher*2/Weebill 1 F(2) families segregated for Lr14b, an unknown seedling leaf rust resistance gene derived from Weebill 1 in both crosses, and Lr17a derived from Jupateco 73S in the RIL population. Lr17a was mapped to the distal end of chromosome 2AS and was linked to microsatellite maker Xgwm636 at a distance of 4.0 cM. The seedling genes did, not condition effective resistance in the field plots with races used in the field trials. The segregation ratio in the RILs and F(2) families indicated the presence of three to four APR genes in Weebill 1. One of the APR genes was linked to the seedling gene Lr14b on chromosome 7BL and reduced leaf rust by 47% in St. Paul and 31% in Mexico. Based on the haplotypes of DNA markers, we do not believe that any of the APR genes is Lr34.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Severe infection can dramatically reduce grain yield and quality. Resistant cultivars have been identified from several countries. However, only a few sources of FHB resistance showed stable FHB resistance across environments and have been used as the major source of resistance in breeding programs. To diversify the wheat FHB-resistance gene pool, new sources of FHB-resistance are desired. Ninety-four selected wheat landraces and cultivars, mainly from China and Japan, have been evaluated for FHB severity and deoxynivalenol (DON) content. Low DON content was correlated with resistance to the FHB symptom spread within an infected spike, but not with the resistance to FHB initial infection. Two-thirds of the accessions were either resistant or moderately resistant to FHB. Among them, 26 highly resistant accessions mainly originated from China and Japan. Fifteen of them had less than 2 mg kg(-1) DON in harvested grain, six of which showed all three types of resistance. Most of these resistant accessions lack known pedigree relations to Sumai 3, suggesting that some of them may carry genes for resistance to FHB and DON accumulation different from those in Sumai 3.

TI Molecular mapping of the leaf rust resistance gene Lr17a in wheat
SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHROMOSOME LOCATION; MAP; LINKAGE
AB Wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., infects millions of acres of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and causes leaves to senesce prematurely, which in turn decreases yield by reducing the plant's ability to complete kernel fill. Lr17a, a leaf rust resistance gene in wheat, is present in many wheat varieties available today. The objective of this research was to identify molecular markers linked to Lr17a. Microsatellite-markers were used on a mapping population of 161 F-2 lines made from a cross of Chinese Spring and Thatcher-Lr17a. Capillary fragment analysis was performed and eight markers were linked to Lr17a, of which Xgwm614 and Xwmc407 flanked Lr17a at genetic distances of 0.7 and 2.5 cM respectively. An evaluation of cultivars with and without Lr17a, and grown in the midwestern United States, revealed that multiple alleles were present for all markers and little correspondence between alleles of closely linked markers and Lr17a was observed. Therefore, caution must taken when using them for marker-assisted selection.

AB Failures of the additive infinitesimal model continue to provide incentive to study other modes of gene action, in particular, epistasis. Epistasis can be modeled as a QTL by genetic background interaction. Association mapping models lend themselves to fitting such an interaction because they often include both main marker and genetic background factors. In this study, I review a model that fits the QTL by background interaction as an added random effect in the now standard mixed model framework of association analyses. The model is applied to four-generation pedigrees where the objective is to predict the genotypic values of fourth-generation individuals that have not been phenotyped. In particular, I look at how well epistatic effects are estimated under two levels of inbreeding. Interaction detection power was 8% and 65% for pedigrees of 240 randomly mated individuals when the interaction generated 6% and 20% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Power increased to 21% and 94% for these conditions when evaluated individuals were inbred by selfing four times. The interaction variance was estimated in an unbiased way under both levels of inbreeding, but its mean squared error was reduced by 40% to 70% when estimated in inbred relative to randomly mated individuals. The performance of the epistatic model was also enhanced relative to the additive model by inbreeding. These results are promising for the application of the model to typically self-pollinating crops such as wheat and soybean.

AB A gene that controls resistance to chickpea rust (Uromyces ciceris-arietini) has been identified in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from an interspecific cross between Cicer arietinum (ILC72) x Cicer reticulatum (Cr5-10), susceptible and resistant to rust, respectively. Both parental lines and all RILs displayed a compatible interaction but differed in the level of infection measured as Disease Severity (DS) and Area Under the Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC). Histological studies of the seedlings of resistant parental Cr5-10 line revealed a reduction in spore germination, appressorium formation, number of haustoria per colony and colony size, with little host cell necrosis, fitting the definition of partial resistance. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) explaining 31% of the total phenotypic variation for DS in seedlings and 81% of the AUDPC in adult plants in the field was located on linkage group 7 of the chickpea genetic map. The AUDPC displayed a bimodal distribution with high frequency of susceptible lines and both the AUDPC and markers showed the same distorted segregation. Consequently, it was hypothesised that a single dominant gene (proposed as Uca1/uca1) controlled resistance to rust in adult plants. This allowed us to locate the gene on the genetic linkage map. Two Sequence Tagged Microsatellite Sites (STMS) markers, TA18 and TA180 (3.9 cM apart) were identified that flank the resistance gene. These findings could be the starting point for a Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) programme for rust resistance in chickpea.

AB Aquaporins, members of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), transport water across cellular membranes and play vital roles in all organisms. Adversities such as drought, salinity, or chilling affect water uptake and transport, and numerous plant MIPs are reported to be differentially regulated under such stresses. However, MIP genes have been not yet been characterized in wheat, the largest cereal crop. We have identified 24 PIP and 11 TIP aquaporin genes from wheat by gene isolation and database searches. They vary extensively in lengths, numbers, and sequences of exons and introns, and sequences and cellular locations of predicted proteins, but the intron positions (if present) are characteristic. The putative PIP proteins show a high degree of conservation of signature sequences or residues for membrane integration, water transport, and regulation. The TIPs are more diverse, some with potential for water transport and others with various selectivity filters including a new combination. Most genes appear to be expressed as expressed sequence tags, while two are likely pseudogenes. Many of the genes are highly identical to rice but some are unique, and many correspond to genes that show differential expression under salinity and/or drought. The results provide extensive information for functional studies and developing markers for stress tolerance.

AB A pyramided FHB resistance line of wheat (WSY) was previously developed from three FHB resistant cultivars (Sumai 3, Wangshuibai, and Nobeokabouzu) in the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China. In the present study, we analyzed the genetic relationship between WSY and the three parental cultivars using DNA markers in order to clarify how many and which resistance genes had accumulated in WSY. We analyzed 282 DNA markers from the 21 wheat chromosomes. WSY was found to include different chromosome regions that harbored putative FHB QTLs of the three parental germplasm. Haplotypes of DNA markers on these QTL regions revealed that the 1BL, 2BL, 5AS, and 7AL QTL regions were from Sumai 3, the 2AS, 2DS, 3AS, and 6BS QTL regions were from Wangshuibai, and the 3BS QTL region was from Nobeokabouzu. This study showed that different resistance genes from the different resistant germplasm had indeed accumulated in WSY. WSY is a potential resistant resource for FHB resistance in wheat breeding programs.

AB Triticum aestivum 'Opata' is an elite hard red spring wheat that has been used as a parent of the ITMI (International Triticeae Mapping Inititative) mapping population and also in the production of synthetically derived hexaploid wheats, some of which (following selection) show increased drought tolerance relative to Opata. Here, we describe the response of Opata roots to water withholding, using physiological variables and oligonucleotide microarrays. We identified 394 distinct transcripts whose abundance differed (p <= 0.05) at least 1.5-fold between water-limited and control roots of Opata, of which 190 transcripts increased and 204 decreased following water limitation. In addition to previously characterized markers of abiotic stress and many genes of unknown function, we identified multiple putative glucanases and class III peroxidases as being particularly responsive to stress. We also compared these data to previously described microarray analyses of Opata's more drought-tolerant, synthetic-derived progeny, and found a relatively high correlation (r = 0.7) between responsive transcripts in the two genotypes, despite differing physiological responses. Some of the transcripts that we confirmed by qRT-PCR as being differentially expressed between Opata and the more tolerant synthetic-derived genotype under stress include a class III peroxidase, an AP2-family transcription factor, and several transcripts of unknown function.

AB Breeding for preharvest sprouting (PHS) resistance is of great interest in wheat-growing areas where high rainfall occurs during grain ripening and harvest. We have characterized 32 wheat accessions using 33 microsatellite markers flanking PHS quantitative trait loci (QTLs) previously identified on group 3, 4, 5, and 6 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat. A total of 229 alleles, with an average of 6.94 alleles per marker, were observed among the 32 wheat lines. The polymorphic information content (PIC) was estimated and ranged between 0.25 and 0.90, with an average of 0.67. A cluster analysis revealed 3 main clusters and 3 singlet wheat lines, which is in agreement with pedigree-based relationships, seed coat colour, and origin. Canadian wheat accessions were subdivided into 4 sub-clusters based on pedigree and wheat classes. Grouping of preharvest sprouting germplasm into Clusters was consistent with cluster-specific allele diversity observed in the PHS-resistant lines AUS 1408, Red-RL4137, White-RL4137, and Kenya321. The implications of these findings in white wheat breeding for PHS tolerance are discussed.

AB Genetic analysis of data in F-2 generation derived from the cross NP852/C591 (M8) and NP846/C591 (M8) revealed that flecking in mutant C591(M8) of Triticum aestivum L. is controlled by a single dominant gene. The mutant C591(M8) was also crossed with individual monosomic lines of Chinese Spring and monosomic F-1 plants were cytologically identified. The F-2 plants derived from individual monosomic F(1)s were scored for the presence of flecking. No critical line could be identified as several lines deviated from expected Mendelian ratio. Considering the peculiar characteristics of the mutation, which resembled the disease lesion mimic mutations reported in other crops such as maize, this indeed is a mutation in hexaploid wheat. The gene symbol Flk is proposed for flecking (= lesion mimic) in the mutant line C591(M8). The flecking mutant will serve as a useful genetic marker.

Genetic stocks were evaluated for seedling resistance as well as field resistance with prevalent and virulent pathotypes of Puccinia triticina, Puccinia graminiss tritici and Puccinia striiformis. With the help of classical tools resistance genes were fixed in the early generation. Incorporation of resistance gene in the genetic stock viz. Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, YrSP, U9, Lr19, U24, U26, U32, U39, U28, U42, U45 was confirmed through allelism tests and presence of leaf rust resistance genes viz.Lr9, Lr19, Lr24 and Lr26 were also authenticated through molecular markers. Rust resistance and utility of genetic stocks are discussed.

AB The bread wheat elasticity, which is very important for bread-making quality, is largely determined by the composition of high molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS). The HMW-GS encoded by Glu-B1 loci are highly polymorphic and the combinations 17 + 18 and 14 + 15 are good for bread making. Thus it is very important to identify the alleles at Glu-B1 loci for wheat quality improvement. In this study, the five common HMW-GS types encoded by Glu-B1x locus carried by 18 Chinese bread wheat cultivars (or lines) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Two pairs of PCR primers which could distinguish the Glu-Blx alleles of the five common HMW-GS types were designed based on the Glu-Blx gene sequences (Reddy and Appels, 1993; Genbank accession: X13927; Genbank accession: AY 3677 71). 22 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Jing711 (contains 17 subunit on Glu-Blx) and Pm97034 (contains 14 subunit on Glu-Blx) were used to validate the accuracy of the primers, which showed that the two specific markers could be used together to distinguish alleles at Glu-Blx locus and accelerate wheat quality breeding by marker assisted selection.

AB Grain hardness is very important in determining the milling and end-use quality of bread wheat. The objectives of this study were to develop gene specific primers for the allele Pina-D1b, evaluate the method for, the identification of Pinb-D1p with restriction enzyme PflMI and characterize allelic variations at Pina and Pinb loci in Shandong wheat germplasm. Based on the nucleotide sequences of Ha locus reported previously (CR626934 and CR626926), 121 primer sets were developed to test the Pina-D1b allele. Sequence alignment showed that the promoter region of Pina-D1b allele was highly conserved in the region from - 1134 to -23 bp relative to the transcription start codon ATG. Pinb-D1p was first reported in Chinese wheat landraces, with a base A deletion at position 213 in the coding region. Restriction analysis of Pinb-D1p indicated that the base A deletion resulted in the missing of the cleavage site with enzyme PflMI and the digestion with PflMI was validated as a reliable tool for the identification of Pinb-D1p allele. A total of 523 wheat accessions from Shandong province including 431 landraces, 63 historical and 29 current cultivars were chosen for the test of SKCS hardness and identification of puroindoline alleles using DNA markers developed in this study and those reported previously. Frequencies of soft, mixed and hard genotypes were 3.9%, 20.4% and 75.6% in Shandong landraces; 68.3%, 19.0% and 12.7% in historical cultivars; and 27.6%, 58.6% and 13.8% in current cultivars, respectively. Frequencies of Pina-D1b, Pinb-D1b and Pinb-D1p were 38.0%, 0.9% and 59.6% in hard landraces; and 37.5%, 37.5% and 25% in hard historical cultivars, respectively, whereas the Pinb-D1b was the only genotype in hard current cultivars. A novel Pinb allele with double mutations at the positions 96 (C to A) and 213 (deletion of A) was found in three landraces and designated as Pinb-D1aa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To identify EST-SSR molecular markers, 41,986 cattle UniGene sequences from NCBI were mined for analyzing SSRs. A total of 1,831 SSRs were identified from 1,666 ESTs, which represented an average density of 19.88 kb per SSR. The frequency of EST-SSRs was 4.0%. The dinucleotide repeat motif was the most abundant SSR, accounting for 54%, followed by 22%, 13%, 7% and 4%, respectively, for tri-, hexa-, penta- and tetra-nucleotide repeats. Depending upon the length of the repeat unit, the length of microsatellites varied from 14 to 86 bp. Among the di- and tri-nucleotide repeats, AC/TG (57%) and AGC (12%) were the most abundant type. Annotation of EST-SSRs was also carried out. Three hundred primer pairs were randomly designed using Prime Premier 5.0 program and Oligo 5.0 for further experimental validation.

AB Aim Wheat stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is the most important foliar disease on wheat in China. Early molecular diagnosis and detection of stripe rust will provide a useful aid to the accurate forecast and seasonal control of this destructive disease. Our objective was to develop PCR assays for the rapid identification and detection of P. striiformis.
   Methods and Results: The genomic DNA of P. striiformis and P. triticina were amplified by a pair of primers derived from conserved beta-tubulin gene sequence. A 235-bp specific DNA fragment of P. striiformis was isolated and purified. Based on its sequence, another two primer sets were designed successfully to obtain new sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers of P. striiformis, which could be amplified in all test isolates of P. striiformis, whereas no DNA fragment was obtained in other nontarget wheat pathogens. The detection limit of the primer set YR (f)/YR (r1) was 2.20 pg mu l(-1). The new SCAR markers of P. striiformis can also be detected in Pst-infected wheat leaves postinoculated for 2 days.
   Conclusions: Our assays are significantly faster than the conventional methods used in the identification of P. striiformis.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Development of a simple, high-throughput assay kit for the rapid diagnosis and detection of wheat stripe rust would be anticipated in a further study.

AB A key challenge in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for molecular plant breeding is to develop markers linked to genes of interest which are applicable to multiple breeding populations. In this study representative F-2 plants from a cross Mandalup (resistant to anthracnose disease) x Quilinock (susceptible) of Lupinus angustifolius were used in DNA fingerprinting by Microsatellite-anchored Fragment Length Polymorphism (MFLP). Nine candidate MFLP markers linked to anthracnose resistance were identified, then 'validated' on 17 commercial cultivars. The number of "false positives" (showing resistant-allele band but lack of the R gene) for each of the nine candidate MFLP markers on the 17 cultivars ranged from 1 to 9. The candidate marker with least number of false positive was selected, sequenced, and was converted into a co-dominant, sequence-specific, simple PCR based marker suitable for routine implementation. Testing on 180 F-2 plants confirmed that the converted marker was linked to the R gene at 5.1 centiMorgan. The banding pattern of the converted marker was consistent with the disease phenotype on 23 out of the 24 cultivars. This marker, designated "AnManM1", is now being used for MAS in the Australian lupin breeding program. We conclude that generation of multiple candidate markers, followed by a validation step to select the best marker before conversion to an implementable form is an efficient strategy to ensure wide applicability for MAS.

AB Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) is a type of cultivated sorghums and has been recognized widely as potential alternative source of bio-fuel because of its high fermentable sugar content in the stalk. A substantial variation of sugar content and related traits is known to exist in US sweet sorghum. The objectives of the study were to assess the genetic diversity and relationship among the US sweet sorghum cultivars and lines using SSR markers and to examine the genetic variability within sweet sorghum accessions for sugar content. Sixty-eight sweet sorghum and four grain sorghum cultivars and lines were genotyped with 41 SSR markers that generated 132 alleles with an average of 3.22 alleles per locus. Polymorphism information content (PIC) value, a measure of gene diversity, was 0.40 with a range of 0.03-0.87. The genetic similarity co-efficient was estimated based on the segregation of the 132 SSR alleles. Clustering analysis based on the genetic similarity (GS) grouped the 72 sorghum accessions into 10 distinct clusters. Grouping based on clustering analysis was in good agreement with available pedigree and genetic background information. The study has revealed the genetic relationship of cultivars with unknown parentage to those with known parentage. A number of diverse pairs of sweet sorghum accessions were identified which were polymorphic at many SSR loci and significantly different for sugar content as well. Information generated from this study can be used to select parents for hybrid development to maximize the sugar content and total biomass, and development of segregating populations to map genes controlling sugar content in sweet sorghum.

AB Mutational load and resource allocation factors and their effects on limiting seed set were investigated in ryegrass by comparative mapping genomics and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in two perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) mapping families sharing common genetic markers.
   Quantitative trait loci for seed-set were identified on chromosome (LG) 7 in both families and on LG4 of the F2/WSC family. On LG7, seed-set and heading date QTLs colocalized in both families and cannot be unequivocally resolved. Comparative genomics suggests that the LG7 region is syntenous to a region of rice LG6 which contains both fertility (S5(n)) and heading date (Hd1, Hd3a) candidate genes. The LG4 region is syntenous to a region of rice LG3 which contains a fertility (S33) candidate gene. QTL maxima for seed-set and heading date on LG4 in the F2/WSC family are separated by c. 8 cm, indicating distinct genetic control.
   Low seed set is under the control of recessive genes at both LG4 and LG7 locations.
   The identification of QTLs associated with seed set, a major component of seed yield in perennial ryegrass, indicates that mutational load associated with these genomic regions can be mitigated through marker-assisted selection.

AB Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees is a forage grass native to the semiarid regions of Southern Africa, which reproduces mainly by pseudogamous diplosporous apomixis. A collection of ESTs was generated from four cDNA libraries, three of them obtained from panicles of near-isogenic lines with different ploidy levels and reproductive modes, and one obtained from 12 days-old plant leaves. A total of 12,295 high-quality ESTs were clustered and assembled, rendering 8,864 unigenes, including 1,490 contigs and 7,394 singletons, with a genome coverage of 22%. A total of 7,029 (79.11%) unigenes were functionally categorized by BLASTX analysis against sequences deposited in public databases, but only 37.80% could be classified according to Gene Ontology. Sequence comparison against the cereals genes indexes (GI) revealed 50% significant hits. A total of 254 EST-SSRs were detected from 219 singletons and 35 from contigs. Di- and tri- motifs were similarly represented with percentages of 38.95 and 40.16%, respectively. In addition, 190 SNPs and Indels were detected in 18 contigs generated from 3 to 4 libraries. The ESTs and the molecular markers obtained in this study will provide valuable resources for a wide range of applications including gene identification, genetic mapping, cultivar identification, analysis of genetic diversity, phenotype mapping and marker assisted selection.

AB The wheat accession H9020-17-15 is a translocation line previously developed from interspecific hybridization between common wheat and Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng. This translocation line showed resistance to all Chinese stripe-rust races. In this study, the gene conferring rust disease resistance in H9020-17-15 was deduced originating from R huashanica. This resistance gene, temporarily designated as YrHua, was confirmed to be dominant and monogenetically controlled. To molecularly map YrHua, a F-2 segregating population comprised of 119 individuals was constructed on the basis of the hybridization between H9020-17-15 and a susceptible wheat line Mingxian 169. The linkage relationship with YrHua was evaluated for 166 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers by analyzing this segregating population. YrHua was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6A linked with the SSR marker Xgwm169 with a distance of 28.7 W. Using AFLP to analyze the F-2 population, two additional AFLP markers PM14 (301) and PM42 (249) were identified to be flanking YrHua at a distance of 5.4 and 2.7 W, respectively. PM14 (301) was further developed into a 296-bp Sequence Tagged Site (STS) marker. These markers will be useful to combine YrHua with other genes for resistance gene pyramiding.

AB The inheritance and genetic linkage analysis for seed dormancy and preharvest sprouting (PHS) resistance were carried out in an F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between "CN19055" (white-grained, PHS-resistant) with locally adapted Australian cultivar "Annuello" (white-grained, PHS-susceptible). Seed dormancy was assessed as germination index (GI7) while assessment for preharvest sprouting resistance was based on whole head assay (sprouting index, SI) and visibly sprouted seeds (VI). Segregation analysis of the F-2, F-3 data from the glasshouse and the RIL population in 2004 and 2005 field data sets indicated that seed dormancy and PHS resistance in CN19055 is controlled by at least two genes. Heritabilities for GI7 and VI were high and moderate for SI. The most accurate method for assessing PHS resistance was achieved using VI and GI7 while SI exhibited large genotype by environment interaction. Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) QPhs.dpivic.4A.1 and QPhs.dpivic.4A.2 were identified. On pooled data across four environments, the major QTL, QPhs.dpivic.4A.2, explained 45% of phenotypic variation for GI7, 43% for VI and 20% for SI, respectively. On the other hand, QPhs.dpivic.4A.1 which accounted for 31% of the phenotypic variation in GI7 in 2004 Horsham field trial, was not stable across environments. Physical mapping of two SSR markers, Xgwm937 and Xgwm894 linked to the major QTL for PHS resistance, using Chinese Spring deletions lines for chromosome 4AS and 4AL revealed that the markers were located in the deletion bins 4AL-12 and 4AL-13. The newly identified SSR markers (Xgwm937/Xgwm894) showed strong association with seed dormancy and PHS resistance in a range of wheat lines reputed to possess PHS resistance. The results suggest that Xgwm937/Xgwm894 could be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for incorporating preharvest sprouting resistance into elite wheat cultivars susceptible to PHS.

AB The present study aimed to localize exotic quantitative trait locus (QTL) alleles for the improvement of leaf rust (P. triticina) resistance in an advanced backcross (AB) population, B22, which is derived from a cross between the winter wheat cultivar Batis (Triticum aestivum) and the synthetic wheat accession Syn022L. The latter was developed from hybridization of T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides and T. tauschii. Altogether, 250 BC2F3 lines of B22 were assessed for seedling resistance against the leaf rust isolate 77WxR under controlled conditions. In addition, field resistance against leaf rust was evaluated by assessing symptom severity under natural infestation across multiple environments. Simultaneously, population B22 was genotyped with a total of 97 SSR markers, distributed over the wheat A, B and D genomes. The phenotype and genotype data were subjected to QTL analysis by applying a 3-factorial mixed model analysis of variance including the marker genotype as a fixed effect and the environments, the lines and the marker by environment interactions as random effects. The QTL analysis revealed six putative QTLs for seedling resistance and seven for field resistance. For seedling resistance, the effects of exotic QTL alleles improved resistance at all detected loci. The maximum decrease of disease symptoms (-46.3%) was associated with marker locus Xbarc149 on chromosome ID. For field resistance, two loci had stable main effects across environments and five loci exhibited marker by environment interaction effects. The strongest effects were detected at marker locus Xbarc149 on chromosome ID, at which the exotic allele decreased seedling symptoms by 46.3% and field symptoms by 43.6%, respectively. Some of the detected QTLs co-localized with known resistance genes, while others appear to be as novel resistance loci. Our findings indicate, that the exotic wheat accession Syn022L may be useful for the improvement of leaf rust resistance in cultivated wheat.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat worldwide. The cultivar Spark is more resistant than most other UK winter wheat varieties but the genetic basis for this is not known. A mapping population from a cross between Spark and the FHB susceptible variety Rialto was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance. QTL analysis across environments revealed nine QTL for FHB resistance and four QTL for plant height (PH). One FHB QTL was coincident with the Rht-1D locus and accounted for up to 51% of the phenotypic variance. The enhanced FHB susceptibility associated with Rht-D1b is not an effect of PH per se as other QTL for height segregating in this population have no influence on susceptibility. Experiments with near-isogenic lines supported the association between susceptibility and the Rht-D1b allele conferring the semi-dwarf habit. Our results demonstrate that lines carrying the Rht-1Db semi-dwarfing allele are compromised in resistance to initial infection (type I resistance) while being unaffected in resistance to spread within the spike (type II resistance).

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is a major disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that can be controlled by resistance breeding. The CIMMYT bread wheat line Saar is known for its good level of partial and race non-specific resistance, and the aim of this study was to map QTLs for resistance to powdery mildew in a population of 113 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between Saar and the susceptible line Avocet. The population was tested over 2 years in field trials at two locations in southeastern Norway and once in Beijing, China. SSR markers were screened for association with powdery mildew resistance in a bulked segregant analysis, and linkage maps were created based on selected SSR markers and supplemented with DArT genotyping. The most important QTLs for powdery mildew resistance derived from Saar were located on chromosomes 7DS and 1BL and corresponded to the adult plant rust resistance loci Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29. A major QTL was also located on 4BL with resistance contributed by Avocet. Additional QTLs were detected at 3AS and 5AL in the Norwegian testing environments and at 5BS in Beijing. The population was also tested for leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (caused by P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistance and leaf tip necrosis in Mexico. QTLs for these traits were detected on 7DS and 1BL at the same positions as the QTLs for powdery mildew resistance, and confirmed the presence of Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29 in Saar. The powdery mildew resistance gene at the Lr34/Yr18 locus has recently been named Pm38. The powdery mildew resistance gene at the Lr46/Yr29 locus is designated as Pm39.

AB The wheat gene-rich region (GRR) 5L0.5 contains many important genes, including Phi, the principal regulator of chromosome pairing. Comparative marker analysis identified 32 genes for the GRR controlling important agronomic traits. Detailed characterization of this region was accomplished by first physically localizing 213 wheat group 51-specific markers, using group.5 nulli-tetrasomics, three Phi gene deletion/insertion mutants, and nine terminal deletion lines with their breakpoints around the 5L0.5 region. The Phi gene was localized to a much smaller region within the GRR (Phi gene region). Of the 61 markers that mapped in the four subregions of the GRR, 9 mapped in the Phi gene region. High stringency sequence comparison (e < 1 x 10(-25)) Of 157 group 5L-specific wheat ESTs identified orthologs for 80% sequences in rice and 71% in Arabidopsis. Rice orthologs were present on all rice chromosomes, although most (34%) were on rice chromosome 9 (119). No single collinear region was identified in Arabidopsis even for a smaller region, such as the Phi gene region. Seven of the nine Phi gene region markers mapped within a 450-kb region on R9 with the same gene order. Detailed domain/motif analysis of the 91 putative genes present in the 450-kb region identified 26 candidates for the Phi gene, including genes involved in chromatin reorganization, microtubule attachment, acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, DNA binding, and meiosis/anther specific proteins. Five of these genes shared common domains/motifs with the meiosis specific genes Zip1, Scp1, Cor1, RAD50, RAD51, and RAD57. Wheat and Arabidopsis homologs for these rice genes were identified.

AB We previously published a genetic map of Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum sensu lato) based on a cross between Kansas strain Z-3639 (lineage 7) and Japanese strain R-5470 (lineage 6). In this study, that genetic map was aligned with the third assembly of the genomic sequence of G. zeae strain PH-I (lineage 7) using seven structural genes and 108 sequenced amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Several linkage groups were combined based on the alignments, the nine original linkage groups were reduced to six groups, and the total size of the genetic map was reduced from 1,286 to 1,140 centimorgans. Nine supercontigs, comprising 99.2% of the genomic sequence assembly, were anchored to the genetic map. Eight markers (four markers from each parent) were not found in the genome assembly, and four of these markers were closely linked, suggesting that >150 kb of DNA sequence is missing from the PH-1 genome assembly. The alignments of the linkage groups and supercontigs yielded four independent sets, which is consistent with the four chromosomes reported for this fungus. Two proposed heterozygous inversions were confirmed by the alignments; otherwise, the colinearity of the genetic and physical maps was high. Two of four regions with segregation distortion were explained by the two selectable markers employed in making the cross. The average recombination rates for each chromosome were similar to those previously reported for G. zeae. Despite an inferred history of genetic isolation of lineage 6 and lineage 7, the chromosomes of these lineages remain homologous and are capable of recombination along their entire lengths, even within the inversions. This genetic map can now be used in conjunction with the physical sequence to study phenotypes (e.g., fertility and fitness) and genetic features (e.g., centromeres and recombination frequency) that do not have a known molecular signature in the genome.

AB 'Glenlea' wheat (Triticum aestivum) is resistant to prevalent races of loose smut (Ustilago tritici) found on the Canadian prairies. Little is known about the genetics of this resistance. This study was undertaken to determine if 'Glenlea' possesses a single gene with broad resistance to multiple loose smut races representing virulence found on the Canadian Prairies. 'Glenlea' was crossed with the susceptible cultivar 'AC Taber', and doubled haploid lines were produced from the resulting F-1 plants. Each of the 62 lines was inoculated with U. tritici races T2, T9, T10 T15, T19, and T39. The differential segregation of lines to these races could be explained by no fewer than three major and possibly two minor genes within 'Glenlea'. No one major gene provided complete or moderate resistance to all races representing the prominent virulence of U. tritici oil the prairies (T2, T9. T10, and T39). The implications for marker development are that at least two markers would be required, one to each of the genes that complement each other to provide broad resistance.

AB One of the major allergenic proteins in common buckwheat (Fagopyrum elculentum) was found to be a BW10KD. In this work, allergenic BW10KD genomic DNAs from the native common buckwheat 'Pyeongchang' and Tartarian buck-wheat 'Clfa47' were cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and their nucleotide sequences were determined. In addition, a novel PCR assay targeting the allergenic BW10KD gene was developed to detect and differentiate both buckwheat species in food. The nucleotide sequences of the BW10KD genomic DNA from 'Pyeongchang' and 'Clfa47' were 94% identical. Base differences in the nucleotide sequences of the BW10KD genes are probably useful as a molecular marker for species-specific identification. The 'Pyeongchang'-specific primer set 154PF/400PR and the 'Clfa47'-specific primer set 154DF/253DR generated 247 and 100 bp fragments in singleplex PCR, respectively. A duplex PCR assay with 2 species-specific primer sets simultaneously differentiated the 'Pyeongchang' and 'Clfa47' in a single reaction. The PCR assay also successfully allowed for the rapid detection of buckwheat ingredients in foods.

AB Eucalyptus is an important short rotation pulpy woody plant, grown widely in the tropics. Recently, many genomic programmes are underway leading to the accumulation of voluminous genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences in public databases. These sequences can be utilized for analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) available in the transcribed genes. In this study, in silico analysis of 15,285 sequences representing partial and full-length mRNA from Eucalyptus species for their use in developing SSRs or microsatellites were carried out. A total of 875 EST-SSRs were identified from 772 SSR containing ESTs. Motif size of 6 for dinucleotide and 5 for trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, and pentanucleotides were considered in locating the microsatellites. The average frequency of identified SSRs was 12.9%. The dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant among the dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide motifs and accounted for 50.9% of the Eucalyptus genome. Primer designing analysis showed that 571 sequences with SSRs had sufficient flanking regions for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer synthesis. Evaluation of the usefulness of the SSRs showed that EST-derived SSRs can generate polymorphic markers as all the primers showed allelic diversity among the 16 provenances of E. tereticornis.

AB Microsatellites (SSRs) are widely used in cereal research, and their use in marker assisted breeding has increased the speed and efficiency of germplasm improvement. Central to the application of SSRs for many purposes are methodologies enabling the low-cost acquisition of large quantities of genetic information for gene and genotype identification. In this study, multiplex-ready PCR was evaluated in barley and bread wheat as an approach for rapid and more automated SSR genotyping on a fluorescence-based DNA fragment analyzer. Multiplex-ready PCR is a method that allows SSR genotyping to be performed using a standardized protocol. The method enables flexible fluorescence labeling of SSRs, generates a relatively constant amount of PCR product for each marker, and has a high amenability to multiplex PCR (the simultaneous amplification of several SSRs in the same reaction). A high (92%) compatibility of published SSRs with multiplex-ready PCR is demonstrated, and the usefulness of the method for large scale genotyping is shown by its application for whole genome marker assisted breeding in barley. A database of more than 2,800 barley and wheat SSRs, and a suite of bio-informatic tools were developed to support the deployment of multiplex-ready PCR for various genetic applications, and are accessible at http://www.genica.net.au. Multiplex-ready PCR is broadly applicable to cereal genomics research and marker assisted breeding, and should be transferable to similar analyses of any animal or plant species.

AB The objectives of this study were to construct a linkage map and identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling root aerenchyma formation in drained soil conditions using 195 F-2 individuals derived from a cross between maize inbred line B73 x teosinte Zea luxurians. A 107 SSR marker based map covering 1,331 cM across all ten chromosomes was developed. One significant difference between the parents utilized in the study was that under non-flooding conditions, B73 exhibits a minor capacity to develop root aerenchyma, whereas Z. luxurians exhibits a high tendency to form aerenchyma. Linkage analysis indicated segregation distortion regions on chromosomes 2, 4 and 8, and severe recombination suppression on the long arm of chromosome 4. Multiple interval mapping analysis suggests that five QTLs for aerenchyma formation in non-flooding conditions are located on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 9 and 10, and these explained 36.3% of the total phenotyphic variance. The Z. luxurians alleles in all five QTLs increased the capacity to form aerenchyma and the locations of these QTLs did not overlap those previously identified in the teosinte Z. nicaraguensis. By transferring aerenchyma-forming QTLs from both Z. luxurians and Z. nicaraguensis, it may be possible to pyramid these genes and develop a maize line with exceptional aerenchyma formation and a high level of tolerance to flooding conditions.

AB The current technology of using DNA markers facilitated the pyramiding of bacterial leaf blight (BLB) resistance genes, selection and development of five elite lines after three backcrosses. These DNA marker-aided selection (MAS)-derived lines were evaluated for yield and grain qualities in farmers' fields in 15 environments in 2000-2002, after inoculation with nine races of BLB pathogen in the screen house. GGE biplot analyses were conducted to identify the stable genotype for deployment as well as the suitable areas for its commercial grain production. Analysis on grain quality and disease reaction also aimed to determine donor parents for the trait and identify BLB races that will be useful in further screening for resistance. Results showed AR32-19-3-3 has the best yielding line for deployment in Nueva Ecija, Baler and Eastern Samar provinces. It has the best package of resistance to all BLB races and the grain traits commonly found in IR64, the most popular quality rice in the Philippines. It is a good donor for grain quality traits such as amylose content and grain shape. GGE biplot analyses pinpointed the best in this line, thus supporting the varietal release of A R32-19-3-3 in 2006, currently called NSIC Rc142 - 'Tubigan 7. 'Among the lines, AR32-4-58-2 is a good donor for high milling recovery, head rice and crude protein content. Race 6 is the best representative race for inoculation among BLB races, while races I and 5 are good for BLB resistance screening.

AB To select agronomically useful transgenic plants, a large number of transgenic events are initially produced, gene transfer confirmed, and advanced to obtain homozygous lines for testing in field trials. Direct in planta assays for identifying the transgene carriers in the segregating progeny are based on the activity of selectable marker gene and are easy, simple and inexpensive. For this purpose, expression of bar gene as measured by tolerance to damage by glufosinate ammonium, the active ingredient in the herbicide BASTA, was investigated. Dose damage curves were generated by leaf paint tests with BASTA on four genotypes of sorghum. Transgenic plants were characterized in terms of sensitivity to the concentration of glufosinate ammonium. In transgenics, symptoms of BASTA swab tests at different growth stages and PCR analysis for cry1B were carried out and correlated. Germination tests could not be employed for large scale evaluation of transgenic progeny because of mortality of tolerant seedlings after transplantation to soil. Based on the above findings, a simple, inexpensive, time-saving, two-step scheme for effective evaluation of transgenics and their progeny containing bar gene as selection marker using BASTA swab tests is described.

AB Wheat quality properties are genetically determined by the compositions of high and low molecular weight glutenin subunits, grain hardness, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and starch viscosity. Two multiplex PCR assays were developed and validated using 70 cultivars and advanced lines from Chinese autumn-sown wheat regions. Multiplex PCR I includes molecular markers for genes/loci omega-secalin, Glu-B1-2a (By8), Glu-D1-1d (Dx5), Glu-A3d, Glu-B3 (for non-1B.1R type) and Pinb-D1b targeting improved gluten parameters and pan bread quality. Multiplex PCR II comprises markers for genes/loci Ppo-A1, Ppo-D1 and Wx-B1b targeting improved noodle quality. The results were consistent with those achieved by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC, indicating that the two multiplex assays were highly effective, with good repeatability and low costs enabling their use in wheat breeding programmes. In total, nine alleles (subunits) at locus Glu-B1, four at Glu-D1 and five at Glu-A3 locus were identified, and the alleles (Subunits) Glu-B1b (7 + 8), Glu-B1c (7 + 9), Glu-D1a (2 + 12), Glu-D1d (5 + 10), Glu-A3a, Glu-A3c and Glu-A3d were most frequently present in the cultivars and lines tested. The 1B.1R translocation was present in 28 (40.0%) lines, whereas the Wx-B1 null allele for better noodle quality was present in only seven (10.0%) cultivars and advanced lines, and 37 (52.9%) lines had Pinb-D1b associated with hard grains. The allele Ppo-A1b on chromosome 2AL associated with lower PPO activity was present in 38 (54.3%) genotypes, whereas the less effective allele Ppo-D1a on chromosome 2DL, also associated with low PPO activity was present in 45 (64.3%) of genotypes. These two multiplex PCR assays should be effective in marker assisted selection targeting improved pan bread-making and noodle qualities.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici, is an important disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) was employed to identify SRAP (sequence-related amplified polymorphism), sequence tagged site (STS) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers linked to the Pm4b gene, which confers good resistance to powdery mildew in wheat. Out of 240 SRAP primer combinations tested, primer combinations Me8/Em7 and Me12/Em7 yielded 220-bp and 205-bp band, respectively, each of them associated with Pm4b. STS-(241) also linked to Pm4b with a genetic distance of 4.9 cM. Among the eight SSR markers located on wheat chromosome 2AL, Xgwm382 was found to be polymorphic and linked to Pm4b with a genetic distance of 11.8 cM. Further analysis was carried out using the four markers to investigate marker validation for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The results showed that a combination of the linked markers STS-(241), Me8/Em7-(220) and Xgwm382 could be used for marker-assisted selection of the resistance gene Pm4b in wheat breeding programmes.

AB 'Express', a hard red spring wheat cultivar that has been widely grown in the western United States, is used to differentiate races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the causal fungal pathogen of wheat stripe rust. To identify genes conferring race-specific, overall resistance to stripe rust, Express was crossed with 'Avocet S'. The parents and F-1, F-2, F-3 and F-5 populations were tested with races PST-1, PST-21, PST-43, and PST-45 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in the seedling stage under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two dominant genes for resistance to stripe rust were identified, one conferring resistance to PST-1 and PST-21, and the other conferring resistance to all four races. Linkage groups were constructed for the resistance genes using 146 F-5 lines to establish resistance gene analog and chromosome-specific simple sequence repeat marker polymorphisms. The gene for resistance to races PST-1 and PST-21 was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 1B, and that conferring resistance to all four races was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5B. We temporarily designate the gene on 1BL as YrExp1 and the gene on 5BL as YrExp2. Polymorphism of at least one of the two markers flanking YrExp2 was detected in 91% of the 44 tested wheat genotypes, suggesting that they would be useful in marker-assisted selection for combining the gene with other resistance genes into many other wheat cultivars. Knowledge of these genes will be useful to understand recent virulence changes in the pathogen populations.

AB Background: alpha-Amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for the control of seed weevils, as these insects are highly dependent on starch as an energy source. In this study, we aimed to reveal the structure and diversity of dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat from Israel and to elucidate the relationship between the emmer wheat genes and ecological factors using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Another objective of this study was to find out whether there were any correlations between SNPs in functional protein-coding genes and the environment.
   Results: The influence of ecological factors on the genetic structure of dimeric a-amylase inhibitor genes was evaluated by specific SNP markers. A total of 244 dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes were obtained from 13 accessions in 10 populations. Seventy-five polymorphic positions and 74 haplotypes were defined by sequence analysis. Sixteen out of the 75 SNP markers were designed to detect SNP variations in wild emmer wheat accessions from different populations in Israel. The proportion of polymorphic loci P (5%), the expected heterozygosity He, and Shannon's information index in the 16 populations were 0.887, 0.404, and 0.589, respectively. The populations of wild emmer wheat showed great diversity in gene loci both between and within populations. Based on the SNP marker data, the genetic distance of pair-wise comparisons of the 16 populations displayed a sharp genetic differentiation over long geographic distances. The values of P, He, and Shannon's information index were negatively correlated with three climatic moisture factors, whereas the same values were positively correlated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients' analysis with some of the other ecological factors.
   Conclusion: The populations of wild emmer wheat showed a wide range of diversity in dimeric a-amylase inhibitors, both between and within populations. We suggested that SNP markers are useful for the estimation of genetic diversity of functional genes in wild emmer wheat. These results show significant correlations between SNPs in the a-amylase inhibitor genes and ecological factors affecting diversity. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs, and the SNPs could be classified into several categories as ecogeographical predictors. It was suggested that the SNPs in the alpha-amylase inhibitor genes have been subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary influence on gene differentiation at specific loci.

AB Six different 1RS-specific molecular markers (RMS13, Bmac213, GPI, 5S, SCM9, IAG95) were tested in twenty rye cultivars of various origin. The aim of the experiments was to choose rye cultivars which give polymorphic PCR products with these 1RS-specific markers compared to the wheat cultivar Mv Magdalena, which contains the 1BL. 1RS translocation. The polymorphic rye cultivars can be presumed to differ from the 1BL. 1RS translocation originating from the Petkus rye cultivar and will hopefully carry effective resistance genes which can be incorporated into the 1BL. 1RS translocation in wheat. Twenty rye cultivars (at least two plants per cultivar) were analysed with these markers. Of fifty-two rye samples analysed, three plants were found to be polymorphic, one (Kisvardai Alacsony from Hungary), for the 5S marker, one (Kriszta from Hungary) for the RMS13 marker and one (Porto from Portugal) for the SCM9 marker. The polymorphic plants were grown to maturity in the phytotron.

AB Information on the distribution of vernalization genes and their association with growth habit is crucial to understanding the adaptability of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to different environments. In this study, 278 Chinese wheat cultivars were characterized with molecular markers for the vernalization genes Vrn-A1, -B1, -D1, and -B3. Heading time was evaluated in a greenhouse under long days without vernalizaton. The dominant Vrn-D1 allele showed the highest frequency in the Chinese wheat cultivars (37.8%), followed by the dominant Vrn-A1, -B1, and -B3 alleles. Ninety-two winter cultivars carried recessive alleles of all four vernalization loci, whereas 172 spring genotypes contained at least one dominant Vrn allele. All cultivars released in the North China Plain Winter Wheat Zone were winter type. Winter (53.0%), spring (36.1%), and early-heading (10.9%) cultivars were grown in the Yellow and Huai River Valley Winter Zone. Most of the spring genotypes from this zone carried only the dominant Vrn-D1 allele, which was also predominant (64.1%) in the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valley Winter Zone and Southwestern Winter Wheat Zone. In three spring-sown wheat zones, all cultivars were early-heading spring types that frequently possessed the strongest dominant Vrn-A1a allele and combinations with other dominant Vrn gene(s). The Vrn-D1 allele is associated with the latest heading time, Vrn-A1 the earliest, and Vrn-B1 intermediate values. The information is important for breeding programs in countries interested in using Chinese wheats.

AB Seed color is an important trait affecting flour yield and quality in wheat. Seed color also is either tightly linked to or pleiotropically controls seed dormancy in wheat, because most of the red-seeded wheats are tolerant to preharvest sprouting in comparison to white-seeded wheats. Seed color in hexaploid wheat is controlled by the dominant red seed color genes R-A I, R-B1, and R-D1 located in orthologous positions on chromosome arms 3AL, 3BL, and 3DL, respectively. By using wheat ESTs and synteny with rice, we identified one STS marker and one EST marker flanking R-A I in a 4.4-cM interval by using an RIL and F-2 populations of Longdon (LDN)/LDN-DIC3A (disomic substitution of T. turgidum subsp. dicoccoides chromosome 3A for 3A of LDN). Physical mopping of the R-A1 gene using tightly linked markers on a set of deletion lines specific to the long arms of group-3 chromosomes indicated that the red seed color genes are located in the distal region (less than 10% of the chromosome arm 3L), which is a high-recombination, generich region in wheat. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that, except for a very minor rearrangement of gene sequences in wheat relative to rice, macrocolinearity is well conserved between the consensus distal deletion bin of wheat 3L-0.80-1.00 and rice chromosome arm 1L. The R-A1 gene of wheat was targeted into a single PAC of rice using colinear flanking markers.

AB This study aimed to determine factors that influence the detection of DNA of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in the gut contents of arthropod predators when the polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify a diagnostic fragment of the gene coding for cytochrome oxidase subunit I. The effects of temperature, time since feeding, subsequent food intake, sex, weight, and species of predator on prey detectability were studied in the laboratory. Three types of predator were studied: the spider Venator spenceri Hogg. (Araneae: Lycosidae), a bug with sucking mouthparts, Nabis kinbergii (Reuter) (Heteroptera: Nabidae), and a coccinellid with chewing mouthparts, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In all experiments, the detectability of prey DNA was negatively correlated with time post-feeding. The duration of detectability differed among the predator species. The time calculated for median detection success at 20 degrees C ranged from 49.6 h in V. spenceri to 36.1 h in N. kinbergii and 17.1 h in H. variegata. In H. variegata, but not in V. spenceri, the rate of detection decreased with increasing temperature. Subsequent food intake did not affect the detectability of DNA of P. xylostella in V. spenceri. In H. variegata, sex and weight of the predator did not influence detection of prey DNA. In addition, this study uncovered potential sources of error caused by detection of prey DNA following secondary cannibalistic and intraguild predation. The results provide essential information for the interpretation of prey detection data from field-collected predators' gut contents.

AB Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have become a major tool in population genetic analyses. The anonymous genomic SSRs (gSSRs) have been recently supplemented with expressed sequence tag (EST) derived SSRs (eSSRs), which represent the transcribed regions of the genome. In the present study, we used 8 populations of wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides) to compare the usefulness of the two types of SSR markers in assessing allelic diversity and population structure. gSSRs revealed significantly higher diversity than eSSRs in terms of average number of alleles (14.92 vs. 7.4, respectively), polymorphic information content (0.87 vs. 0.68, respectively), and gene diversity (H,; 0.55 vs. 0.38, respectively). Despite the overall differences in the level of diversity, Mantel tests for correlations between eSSR and gSSR pairwise genetic distances were found to be significant for each population as well as for all accessions jointly (R(M) = 0.54, p = 0.01). Various genetic structure analyses (AMOVA, PCoA, STRUCTURE, unrooted UPGMA tree) revealed a better capacity of eSSRs to distinguish between populations, while gSSRs showed a higher proportion of intra-population (among accessions) diversity. We conclude that eSSR and gSSR markers should be employed in conjunction to obtain a high inter- and intra-specific (or inter- and intra-varietal) distinctness.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a serious disease of wheat. The spring wheat cultivar Kariega expresses complete adult plant resistance to stripe rust, whereas Avocet S is susceptible. In former studies, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of doubled haploid lines derived from a Kariega x Avocet S cross revealed two major QTL (QYr. sgi-7D and QYr. sgi- 2B.1) and two minor QTL (QYr. sgi- 1A and QYr. sgi- 4A.1) responsible for the adult resistance of Kariega in the field. Avocet S contains none of these QTL. In the present study, stripe rust development was compared, by means of fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy, in flag leaves of Kariega, Avocet S and six doubled haploid (DH) lines, containing all four, none or one QTL. Depending on the QTL present, the infection types of the DH lines ranged from resistant to fully susceptible. No differences in fungal growth were observed during the first 5 days post inoculation (dpi), whereas the mean length of the fungal colonies started to differ at 6 dpi. Interestingly, MP 51 carrying QYr. sgi-7D responded with lignification to the fungal growth without restricting it, whereas MP 35 containing QYr.sgi-2B.1 did not show lignified host tissue, but fungal growth was restricted. RT PCR experiments with sequences of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins resulted in a slightly stronger induction of PR 1, 2 and 5, known markers for the hypersensitive reaction, and peroxidases in MP 51, whereas a second band for chitinases was detected in MP 35 only.

AB Background: Association mapping, initially developed in human disease genetics, is now being applied to plant species. The model species Arabidopsis provided some of the first examples of association mapping in plants, identifying previously cloned flowering time genes, despite high population sub-structure. More recently, association genetics has been applied to barley, where breeding activity has resulted in a high degree of population sub-structure. A major genotypic division within barley is that between winter- and spring-sown varieties, which differ in their requirement for vernalization to promote subsequent flowering. To date, all attempts to validate association genetics in barley by identifying major flowering time loci that control vernalization requirement (VRN-H1 and VRN-H2) have failed. Here, we validate the use of association genetics in barley by identifying VRN-H1 and VRN-H2, despite their prominent role in determining population sub-structure.
   Results: By taking barley as a typical inbreeding crop, and seasonal growth habit as a major partitioning phenotype, we develop an association mapping approach which successfully identifies VRN-H1 and VRN-H2, the underlying loci largely responsible for this agronomic division. We find a combination of Structured Association followed by Genomic Control to correct for population structure and inflation of the test statistic, resolved significant associations only with VRN-H1 and the VRN-H2 candidate genes, as well as two genes closely linked to VRN-H1 (HvCSFs1 and HvPHYC).
   Conclusion: We show that, after employing appropriate statistical methods to correct for population sub-structure, the genome-wide partitioning effect of allelic status at VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 does not result in the high levels of spurious association expected to occur in highly structured samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both VRN-H1 and the candidate VRN-H2 genes can be identified using association mapping. Discrimination between intragenic VRN-H1 markers was achieved, indicating that candidate causative polymorphisms may be discerned and prioritised within a larger set of positive associations. This proof of concept study demonstrates the feasibility of association mapping in barley, even within highly structured populations. A major advantage of this method is that it does not require large numbers of genome-wide markers, and is therefore suitable for fine mapping and candidate gene evaluation, especially in species for which large numbers of genetic markers are either unavailable or too costly.

AB Background: Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important crop economically and nutritionally, and is one of the most susceptible host crops to colonization of Aspergillus parasiticus and subsequent aflatoxin contamination. Knowledge from molecular genetic studies could help to devise strategies in alleviating this problem; however, few peanut DNA sequences are available in the public database. In order to understand the molecular basis of host resistance to aflatoxin contamination, a large-scale project was conducted to generate expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) from developing seeds to identify resistance-related genes involved in defense response against Aspergillus infection and subsequent aflatoxin contamination.
   Results: We constructed six different cDNA libraries derived from developing peanut seeds at three reproduction stages (R5, R6 and R7) from a resistant and a susceptible cultivated peanut genotypes, 'Tifrunner' (susceptible to Aspergillus infection with higher aflatoxin contamination and resistant to TSWV) and 'GT-C20' (resistant to Aspergillus with reduced aflatoxin contamination and susceptible to TSWV). The developing peanut seed tissues were challenged by A. parasiticus and drought stress in the field. A total of 24,192 randomly selected cDNA clones from six libraries were sequenced. After removing vector sequences and quality trimming, 21,777 high-quality EST sequences were generated. Sequence clustering and assembling resulted in 8,689 unique EST sequences with 1,741 tentative consensus EST sequences (TCs) and 6,948 singleton ESTs. Functional classification was performed according to MIPS functional catalogue criteria. The unique EST sequences were divided into twenty-two categories. A similarity search against the non-redundant protein database available from NCBI indicated that 84.78% of total ESTs showed significant similarity to known proteins, of which 165 genes had been previously reported in peanuts. There were differences in overall expression patterns in different libraries and genotypes. A number of sequences were expressed throughout all of the libraries, representing constitutive expressed sequences. In order to identify resistance-related genes with significantly differential expression, a statistical analysis to estimate the relative abundance (R) was used to compare the relative abundance of each gene transcripts in each cDNA library. Thirty six and forty seven unique EST sequences with threshold of R > 4 from libraries of 'GT-C20' and 'Tifrunner', respectively, were selected for examination of temporal gene expression patterns according to EST frequencies. Nine and eight resistance-related genes with significant up-regulation were obtained in 'GT-C20' and 'Tifrunner' libraries, respectively. Among them, three genes were common in both genotypes. Furthermore, a comparison of our EST sequences with other plant sequences in the TIGR Gene Indices libraries showed that the percentage of peanut EST matched to Arabidopsis thaliana, maize (Zea mays), Medicago truncatula, rapeseed (Brassica napus), rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) ESTs ranged from 33.84% to 79.46% with the sequence identity >= 80%. These results revealed that peanut ESTs are more closely related to legume species than to cereal crops, and more homologous to dicot than to monocot plant species.
   Conclusion: The developed ESTs can be used to discover novel sequences or genes, to identify resistance-related genes and to detect the differences among alleles or markers between these resistant and susceptible peanut genotypes. Additionally, this large collection of cultivated peanut EST sequences will make it possible to construct microarrays for gene expression studies and for further characterization of host resistance mechanisms. It will be a valuable genomic resource for the peanut community. The 21,777 ESTs have been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database with accession numbers ES702769 to ES724546.

AB The powdery mildew resistance allele Pm5d in the backcross-derived wheat lines IGV1-455 (CI10904/7*Prins) and IGV1-556 (CI10904/7*Starke) shows a wide spectrum of resistance and virulent pathotypes have not yet been detected in Germany. Although this allele may be distinguished from the other documented Pm5 alleles by employing a differential set of Blumeria graminis tritici isolates, the use of linked molecular markers could enhance selection, especially for gene pyramiding. Pm5d was genetically mapped relative to six microsatellite markers in the distal part of chromosome 7BL using 82 F-3 families of the cross Chinese Spring x IGV1-455. Microsatellite-based deletion line mapping placed Pm5d in the terminal 14% of chromosome 7BL. The closely linked microsatellite markers Xgwm577 and Xwmc581 showed useful variation for distinguishing the different Pm5 alleles except the ones originating from Chinese wheat germplasm. Their use, however, would be limited to particular crosses because they are not functional markers. The occurrence of resistance genes closely linked to the Pm5 locus is discussed.

AB Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating wheat diseases worldwide. Triticum aestivum-Haynaldia villosa 6VS/6AL translocation lines carrying the Yr26 gene on chromosome 1B, are resistant to most races of Pst used in virulence tests. In order to better utilize Yr26 for wheat improvement, we attempted to screen SSR and EST-based STS markers closely linked with Yr26. A total of 500 F-2 plants and the F-2:3 progenies derived from a cross between 92R137 and susceptible cultivar Yangmai 5 were inoculated with race CYR32. The analysis confirmed that stripe rust resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene, Yr26. Among 35 pairs of genomic SSR markers and 81 pairs of STS markers derived from EST sequences located on chromosome 1B, Yr26 was flanked by 5 SSR and 7 STS markers. The markers were mapped in deletion bins using CS aneuploid and deletion lines. The closest flanking marker loci, Xwe173 and Xbarc181, mapped in 1BL and the genetic distances from Yr26 were 1.4 cM and 6.7 cM, respectively. Some of these markers were previously reported on 1BS. Eight common wheat cultivars and lines developed from the T. aestivum-H. villosa 6VS/6AL translocation lines by different research groups were tested for presence of the markers. Five lines with Yr26 carried the flanking markers whereas three lines without Yr26 did not. The results indicated that the flanking markers should be useful in marker-assisted selection for incorporating Yr26 into wheat cultivars.

AB Three recombinant inbred line populations from the crosses RL6071/Thatcher, RL6071/RL6058 (Thatcher Lr34), and Thatcher/RL6058, were used to study the genetics of stem rust resistance in Thatcher and TcLr34. Segregation of stem rust response in each population was used to determine the number of genes conferring resistance, as well as the effect of the leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 on stem rust resistance. The relationship between resistance in seedling and adult plants was also examined, and an attempt was made to identify microsatellite markers linked to genes that were effective in adult plants. In field plot tests at least three additive resistance genes segregated in the RL6071/RL6058 population, whereas two resistance genes segregated in the RL6071/Thatcher population. The presence of the gene Lr34 permitted the expression of additional stem rust resistance in Thatcher-derived lines both at the seedling and adult plant stages. Seedling resistance to races TPMK and RKQQ was significantly associated with resistance in adult plants, whereas seedling resistance to races QCCD and QCCB may have made a minor contribution. The seedling resistance genes Sr16 and Sr12 may have contributed to resistance in adult plants. A molecular marker linked to resistance in adult plants was identified on chromosome 2BL.

AB Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was tagged with a triple marker gene cassette containing gfp, encoding green fluorescent protein; luxAB, encoding luciferase; and telABkilA, encoding tellurite resistance, and the tagged strain was monitored in the first Swedish field release of a genetically modified microorganism (GMM). The cells were inoculated onto winter wheat seeds and the GMM cells (SBW25:tgl) were monitored in the field from September 2005 to May 2006 using plating, luminometry and microscopic analyses. Cell numbers were high on all sampling occasions and metabolically active cells were detected on all plant parts. Field results were similar to those obtained in a parallel phytotron study, although the amount of SBW25:tgl detected on shoots was significantly higher in the phytotron than in the field. After winter, cell counts were 100-fold higher on the roots and root-associated soil compared with prewinter measurements, although the cells had a lower relative metabolic activity. The wheat seeds were naturally infested with Microdochium nivale, but no treatment resulted in reduction of disease symptoms. No SWB25:tgl cells were ever found in bulk soil or uninoculated plants. The Swedish field trial results complement and contrast with prior field studies performed with the same parent organism in the United Kingdom under different soil, plant and climatic conditions.

AB Changes in plant architecture have been central to the domestication of wild species. Tillering or the degree of branching determines shoot architecture and is a key component of grain yield and/or biomass. Previously, a tiller inhibition mutant with monoculm phenotype was isolated and the mutant gene (tin3) was mapped in the distal region of chromosome arm 3A(m)L of Triticum monococcum. As a first step towards isolating a candidate gene for tin3, the gene was mapped in relation to physically mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and sequence tag site (STS) markers developed based on synteny with rice. In addition, we investigated the relationship of the wheat region containing tin3 with the corresponding region in rice by comparative genomic analysis. Wheat ESTs that had been previously mapped to deletion bins provided a useful framework to identify closely related rice sequences and to establish the most likely syntenous region in rice for the wheat tin3 region. The tin3 gene was mapped to a 324-kb region spanned by two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) of rice chromosome arm 1L. Wheat-rice synteny was exceptionally high at the tin3 region despite being located in the high-recombination, gene-rich region of wheat. Identification of tightly linked flanking EST and STS markers to the tin3 gene and its localization to highly syntenic rice BACs will assist in the future development of a high-resolution map and map-based cloning of the tin3 gene.

AB We report the fine mapping of the previously described quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain weight QTgw.ipk-7D associated with microsatellite marker Xgwm1002-7D by using introgression lines (ILs) carrying introgressions of the synthetic wheat W-7984 in the genetic background of the German winter wheat variety 'Prinz'. The BC4F3 ILs had a 10% increased thousand grain weight compared to the control group and the recurrent parent 'Prinz', and 84.7% of the phenotypic variance could be explained by the segregation of marker Xgwm1002-7D, suggesting the presence of a gene modulating grain weight, which was preliminarily designated g-w1. It was possible to delimit the QTL QTgw.ipk-7D to the interval Xgwm295-Xgwm1002, which is located in the most telomeric bin 7DS4-0.61-1.00 in the physical map of wheat chromosome arm 7DS. Furthermore, our data suggest the presence of a novel plant height-reducing locus Rht on chromosome arm 7DS of 'Prinz'. Larger grain and increased plant height may reflect the pleiotropic action of one gene or may be caused by two linked genes. In general, our data support the concept of using nearly isogenic ILs for validating and dissecting QTLs into single Mendelian genes and open the gateway for map-based cloning of a grain-weight QTL in wheat.

AB Rye chromosome 1R contains many agronomically useful genes. Physical dissection of chromosome 1R into segments would be useful in mapping 1R-specific DNA markers and in assembling DNA clones into contig maps. We applied the gametocidal system to produce rearranged 1R chromosomes of Imperial rye (1R) added to common wheat. We identified rearranged 1R(i) chromosomes and established 55 1R(i) dissection lines of common wheat carrying a single rearranged 1R(i) chromosome. Fifty-two of the rearranged 1R(i) chromosomes had single breakpoints and three had double breakpoints. The 58 breakpoints were distributed in the short arm excluding the satellite (12 breakpoints), in the satellite (4), in the long arm (28), and in the centromere (14). Out of the 55 lines, nine were homozygous for the rearranged 1R(i) chromosomes, and the remaining lines were hemizygous. We developed 26 PCR-based EST markers that were specific to the 1R(i) chromosome, and nine of them amplified 1R(i) arm-specific PCR products without restriction-enzyme digestion. Using the nine EST markers and two previously reported 1R-specific markers, we characterized the 55 1R(i) dissection lines, and also proved that we can select critical progeny plants carrying specific rearranged 1R(i) chromosomes by PCR, without cytological screening, in 48 out of the 55 hemizygous dissection lines.

AB Karnal bunt (KB) resistant near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed using the stock (KBRL 22) with high KB resistance and the widely grown wheat cultivar (PBW 343) as recipient. Genetic analysis in BCF, and BC,F 3 populations revealed involvement of up to three additive genes for KB resistance. Single plants from lines which were uniform for resistance and susceptibility in BC,F 3 1 were advanced to BC,F, and screened further for establishment of extreme NILs. The KB resistant NILs were screened for presence of donor alleles at 93 polymorphic SSR loci using the recipient parent (PBW 343) as control. Donor alleles of four markers; Xgwm99 (1AL), Xgwm149 (4BL), Xgwm174 (5DL) and Xgwm340 (3BL) showed their presence in the resistant pool. These four markers were run on the 11 resistant and 10 susceptible BC,F 4 progenies. Resistant and susceptible phenotypes showed association with three of the four markers viz., Xgwm 99, Xgwm 174 and Xgwm 340 as indicated by the Chi square contingency test.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for plant height in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were studied using a set of 168 doubled haploid (DH) lines, which were derived from the cross Huapei 3/Yumai 57. A genetic linkage map was constructed using 283 SSR and 22 EST-SSR markers. The DH population and the parents were evaluated for wheat plant height in 2005 and 2006 in Tai'an and 2006 in Suzhou. QTL analyses were performed using the software of QTLNetwork version 2.0 based on the mixed linear model. Four additive QTLs and five pairs of epistatic effects were detected, which were distributed on chromosomes 3A, 4B, 4D, 5A, 6A, 7B, and 7D. Among them, three additive QTLs and three pairs of epistatic QTLs showed QTLxenvironment interactions (QEs). Two major QTLs, Qph4B and Qph4D, which accounted for 14.51% and 20.22% of the phenotypic variation, were located similar to the reported locations of the dwarfing genes Rht1 and Rht2, respectively. The Qph3A-2 with additive effect was not reported in previous linkage mapping studies. The total QTL effects detected for the plant height explained 85.04% of the phenotypic variation, with additive effects 46.07%, epistatic effects 19.89%, and QEs 19.09%. The results showed that both additive effects and epistatic effects were important genetic bases of wheat plant height, which were subjected to environmental modifications, and caused dramatic changes in phenotypic effects. The information obtained in this study will be useful for manipulating the QTLs for wheat plant height by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS).

AB Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] is one of the major insect pests of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Hessian fly (Hf)-resistance genes H16 and H17 were reported to condition resistance to Hf biotype L that is prevalent in many wheat-growing areas of eastern USA, and both of them were previously assigned to wheat chromosome 5A by their linkage to H9. The objectives in this study were to (1) map H16 and H17 independent of their linkage with H9 and (2) identify DNA markers that co-segregate with H16 or H17, and that are useful for selection of these genes in segregating populations and to combine these genes with other Hf-resistance genes in wheat cultivars. Contrary to previously reported locations, H16 and H17 did not show linkage with the molecular markers on chromosome 5A. Instead, both of them are linked with the molecular markers on the short arm of chromosome 1A (1AS). The simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker Xpsp2999 and EST-derived SSR (eSSR) marker Xwem6b are two flanking markers that are linked to H16 at genetic distances of 3.7 and 5.5 cM, respectively. Similarly, H17 is located between markers Xpsp2999 and Xwem6b at genetic distances of 6.2 and 5.1 cM, respectively. Five other SSR and eSSR markers including Xcfa2153, Xbarc263, Xwem3a, Xwmc329, and Xwmc24 were also linked to H16 and H17 at close genetic distances. These closely linked molecular markers should be useful for pyramiding H16 and H17 with other Hessian fly resistance genes in a single wheat genotype. In addition, using Chinese Spring deletion line bin mapping we positioned all of the linked markers and the Hf-resistance genes (H16 and H17) to the distal 14% of chromosome 1AS, where Hf-resistance genes H9, H10, and H11 are located. Our results together with previous studies suggest that Hf-resistance genes H9, H10, H11, H16, and H17 along with the pathogen resistance genes Pm3 and Lr10 appear to occupy a resistance gene cluster in the distal region of chromosome 1AS in wheat.

   COMPONENTS
AB Strong selection within a given population locally reduces genetic variability not only in the selected gene itself but also in neighbouring loci. This so-called hitch-hiking effect is related to the initial linkage disequilibrium between markers and the selected gene, and depends mainly on the number of copies of the beneficial allele at the start of the selection phase. Contrary to the classical case, in which selection acts on a single, newly arisen beneficial mutation, we considered selection from standing variation (soft selective sweeps) on a gene (Rht-B1) with a major effect on plant height, a selected trait in an experimental wheat population grown for 17 generations, and we documented the evolution of gene diversity and linkage disequilibrium near this gene. As expected, Rht-B1 was found to be under strong selection (s = 0.15) and its variation in frequency accounted for 15% of the total trait evolution. This led to a smaller genetic effective population size at Rht-B1 (N-eg = 18) compared to the whole genome estimation (N-eg = 167). When compared with expectations under genetic drift only, no significant decrease in gene diversity was found at the closest loci. We computed expected di-locus frequencies for any linked marker-Rht-B1 pair due to hitch-hiking effects. We found that hitch-hiking was expected to affect the two most closely linked loci, but expected reduction in gene diversity was not greater than that due to genetic drift, which was consistent with the observations. Such limited effect was attributed to the low level of linkage disequilibrium (0.16) estimated after parental intercrosses, together with a relatively high initial frequency of the gene. This situation is favourable to candidate gene approaches where small linkage disequilibrium around selected genes is expected.

AB Members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex are important cereal pathogens worldwide and belong to one of at least nine phylogenetically distinct species. We examined 298 strains of the F. graminearum species complex collected from wheat or barley in Japan to determine the species and trichothecene chemotype. Phylogenetic analyses and species-diagnostic polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLPs) revealed the presence and differential distribution of F. graminearum sensu stricto (s. str.) and F. asiaticum in Japan. F. graminearum s. str. is predominant in the north, especially in the Hokkaido area, while F. asiaticum is predominant in southern regions. In the Tohoku area, these species co-occurred. Trichothecene chemo-typing of all strains by multiplex PCR revealed significantly different chemotype compositions. of these species. All 50 strains of F. graminearum s. str. were of a 15- or 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol type, while 173 (70%) out of 246 strains of F. asiaticum were of a nivalenol type. The possibility of gene flow between the two species was investigated by use of 15 PCR-RFLP markers developed in this study. However, no obvious hybrids were detected from 98 strains examined, including strains collected from regions where both species co-occur.

AB Cereal cyst nematodes (Heterodera avenae Woll.) are economically damaging barley parasites in most cereal growing areas of the world and the development of resistant cultivars is the best measure against the pathogen. An ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat) marker identified as closely linked with the H. avenae race 1 and 2 resistance gene (Ha2) has been converted into a codominant sequence characterized amplified region marker (Ha2S18) and mapped in barley 'SW Buddy' x 'SW Cecilia' DH population at 4.3 cM from the Ha2 locus on the long arm of chromosome 2H. The potential usefulness of Ha2S18 in large scale marker assisted selection schemes has been evaluated in a broad genetic background and is an important complement to the bioassay and to other linked DNA-markers for this trait.

AB Allele diversities of four markers specific to intron three, exon four and promoter regions of the aluminum (Al) resistance gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) TaALMT1 were compared in 179 common wheat cultivars used in international wheat breeding programs. In wheat cultivars released during the last 93 years, six different promoter types were identified on the basis of allele size. A previous study showed that Al resistance was not associated with a particular coding allele for TaALMT1 but was correlated with blocks of repeated sequence upstream of the coding sequence. We verified the linkage between these promoter alleles and Al resistance in three doubled haploid and one intercross populations segregating for Al resistance. Molecular and pedigree analysis suggest that Al resistance in modern wheat germplasm is derived from several independent sources. Analysis of a population of 278 landraces and subspecies of wheat showed that most of the promoter alleles associated with Al resistance pre-existed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia prior to dispersal of cultivated germplasm around the world. Furthermore, several new promoter alleles were identified among the landraces surveyed. The TaALMT1 promoter alleles found within the spelt wheats were consistent with the hypothesis that these spelts arose on several independent occasions from hybridisations between non-free-threshing tetraploid wheats and Al-resistant hexaploid bread wheats. The strong correlation between Al resistance and Al-stimulated malate efflux from the root apices of 49 diverse wheat genotypes examined was consistent with the previous finding that Al resistance in wheat is conditioned primarily by malate efflux. These results demonstrate that the markers based on intron, exon and promoter regions of TaALMT1 can trace the inheritance of the Al resistance locus within wheat pedigrees and track Al resistance in breeding programmes.

AB Powdery mildew is an important foliar disease in wheat, especially in areas with a cool or maritime climate. A dominant powdery mildew resistance gene transferred to the hexaploid germplasm line NC99BGTAG11 from T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum was mapped distally on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Differential reactions were observed between the resistance gene in NC99BGTAG11 and the alleles of the Pm1 locus that is also located on chromosome arm 7AL. Observed segregation in F-2:3 lines from the cross NC99BGTAG11 x Axminster (Pm1a) demonstrate that germplasm line NC99BGTAG11 carries a novel powdery mildew resistance gene, which is now designated as Pm37. This new gene is highly effective against all powdery mildew isolates tested so far. Analyses of the population with molecular markers indicate that Pm37 is located 16 cM proximal to the Pm1 complex. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Xgwm332 and Xwmc790 were located 0.5 cM proximal and distal, respectively, to Pm37. In order to identify new markers in the region, wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in the distal 10% of 7AL that were orthologous to sequences from chromosome 6 of rice were targeted. The two new EST-derived STS markers were located distal to Pm37 and one marker was closely linked to the Pm1a region. These new markers can be used in marker-assisted selection schemes to develop wheat cultivars with pyramids of powdery mildew resistance genes, including combinations of Pm37 in coupling linkage with alleles of the Pm1 locus.

AB The Lr34/Yr18 locus has contributed to durable, non-race specific resistance against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregates with resistance to powdery mildew (Pm38) and a leaf tip necrosis phenotype (Ltn1). Using a high resolution mapping family from a cross between near-isogenic lines in the "Thatcher" background we demonstrated that Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregated with stem rust resistance in the field. Lr34/Yr18 probably interacts with unlinked genes to provide enhanced stem rust resistance in "Thatcher". In view of the relatively low levels of DNA polymorphism reported in the Lr34/Yr18 region, gamma irradiation of the single chromosome substitution line, Lalbahadur(Parula7D) that carries Lr34/Yr18 was used to generate several mutant lines. Characterisation of the mutants revealed a range of highly informative genotypes, which included variable size deletions and an overlapping set of interstitial deletions. The mutants enabled a large number of wheat EST derived markers to be mapped and define a relatively small physical region on chromosome 7DS that carried Lr34/Yr18. Fine scale genetic mapping confirmed the physical mapping and identified a genetic interval of less than 0.5 cM, which contained Lr34/Yr18. Both rice and Brachypodium genome sequences provided useful information for fine mapping of ESTs in wheat. Gene order was more conserved between wheat and Brachypodium than with rice but these smaller grass genomes did not reveal sequence information that could be used to identify a candidate gene for rust resistance in wheat. We predict that Lr34/Yr18 is located within a large insertion in wheat not found at syntenic positions in Brachypodium and rice.

AB Background. Polyploidization is a major evolutionary process in plants where hybridization and chromosome doubling induce enormous genomic stress and can generate genetic and epigenetic modifications. However, proper evaluation of DNA sequence restructuring events and the precise characterization of sequences involved are still sparse. Methodology/Principal Findings. Inter Retrotransposons Amplified Polymorphism ( IRAP), Retrotransposons Microsatellite Amplified Polymorphism (REMAP) and Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) largely confirmed the absence of any intraspecific variation in wheat, rye and triticale. The comparative analysis of banding profiles between wheat and rye inbred lines revealed 34% of monomorphic ( common to both parental species) bands for the ten different primer combinations used. The analysis of triticale plants uncovered nearly 51% of rearranged bands in the polyploid, being the majority of these modifications, due to the loss of rye bands (83%). Sequence analysis of rye fragments absent in triticale revealed for instance homology with hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins ( HRGP), a protein that belongs to a major family of inducible defence response proteins. Conversely, a wheat-specific band absent in triticale comprises a nested structure of copia-like retrotransposons elements, namely Claudia and Barbara. Sequencing of a polyploid-specific band ( absent in both parents) revealed a microsatellite related sequence. Cytological studies using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization ( FISH) with REMAP products revealed a widespread distribution of retrotransposon and/or microsatellite flanking sequences on rye chromosomes, with a preferential accumulation in heterochromatic sub-telomeric domains. Conclusions/Significance.. Here, we used PCR-based molecular marker techniques involving retrotransposons and microsatellites to uncover polyploidization induced genetic restructuring in triticale. Sequence analysis of rearranged genomic fragments either from rye or wheat origin showed these to be retrotransposon-related as well as coding sequences. Further FISH analysis revealed possible chromosome hotspots for sequence rearrangements. The role of chromatin condensation on the origin of genomic rearrangements mediated by polyploidization in triticale is also discussed.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB A group of spring wheat cultivars originating from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands was analysed for powdery mildew resistance. Using functional molecular markers, two alleles of the major resistance gene Pm3 were detected among the cultivars under the study. One of the alleles, Pm3d, was detected in the resistant cultivars 'Vinjett', 'SW Estrad', and 'Zebra', and in 'Tjalve', a cultivar of earlier release susceptible to the local population of powdery mildew. The second allele of Pm3 detected in the analysed group of cultivars was the allele Pm3f, rarely used in Europe. It was identified in the resistant cultivars 'Satu', 'Helle', and in the moderatively resistant cultivar 'Mahti'. Pm3f was found to be effective against the local population of powdery mildew in Estonia, while Pm3d provided no protective effect. Besides the Pm3d allele on chromosome 1A, monosomic analysis of the cultivar 'Vinjett',which is almost immune to powdery mildew, identified two additional loci on chromosomes 5D and 7D, respectively, presumably responsible for the high resistance in this cultivar. In contrast to the earlier cultivars, six recently released cultivars ('Vinjett', 'SW Estrad', 'Zebra', 'Satu', 'Helle', 'Meri') demonstrated a high resistance to the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis DC. f. sp. tritici both in the field and seedling tests, showing that the genetic basis of powdery mildew resistance in Nordic spring wheat has been improved noticeably in the last ten years.

AB The effects of insoluble dietary fibre differing in lignin content on intestinal morphology and mRNA expression was tested in an animal model of 48 weaned piglets. Engaged fibre sources were wheat bran (rich in cellulose and hemicellulose) and pollen from Chinese Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) (rich in lignin), respectively. The fibre sources were added to a basal diet as follows: no addition (control), 3.0% wheat bran, 1.27% pine pollen, and 2.55% pine pollen. The 12 animals of each feeding group were fed four experimental diets ad libitum for 37 days and were then slaughtered for retrieving tissue samples from stomach, jejunum, ileum, colon and mesenterial lymph nodes. Both fibre sources increased villus height of mucosa in jejunum (+10% on average) and ileum (+16% on average). Results of mRNA expression rates of inflammatory, cell cycle and growth marker genes (NFB, TNF, TGF, Caspase3, CDK4, IGF1) were specific to fibre source and tissue: wheat bran induced an up-regulation of NFB in stomach and jejunum, as well as TNF and TGF, and Caspase3 in jejunum. Pine pollen induced down regulation of NFB, TNF, TGF, Caspase3, CDK4 and IGF1 in the colon as well as up-regulation of NFB and TGF in mesenterial lymph nodes. Finally, an overall data comparison based on a hierarchical cluster analysis showed a close relation between gene regulation in different gut sections and organs, as well as between small intestine morphology and zootechnical performance.

AB Soft winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs in the US have used two general approaches to developing FHB-resistant cultivars: 1) incorporation of Fhb1 plus other minor QTL from Asian wheat cultivars and their derivatives and 2) reliance on resistance native to the soft winter wheat gene pool. Although each approach has shown same success, it is believed that the two must be integrated to develop the highest levels of resistance. The most favorable scenario for integration is the incorporation of Fhb1 into adapted material with good native resistance, high yield and test weight, and superior milling and baking quality.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is still a very serious disease of wheat in China. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) may provide such a technique for dissecting QTL for FHB resistance and stacking different target gene (QTL) in wheat breeding. In this study three SSR makers were applied to MAS for FHB resistance in breeding populations with high efficiency on selection in F-2 and F-3 populations. In addition, markers associated with QTL for wheat sharp eye-spot (SES), gene Pm4 and Pm21 resistant to powdery mildew, and high molecular weight glutin subunit gene Dx5 and Dy10 were also applied in this breeding program.

ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; GENES; MAP
AB The Green Revolution genes considerably increased the yield potential of modern wheat varieties, but also rendered them more susceptible to Fusarium head blight (FHB) causing problems with mycotoxin contamination. In order to study (lie association of "reduced height" (Rht) genes and FHB resistance, Rht-Blb, Rht-Dlb and Rht8 genes were introduced in tall high-yielding wheat cultivars expressing a good level of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance via marker-assisted selection (MAS). The F(1) plants of five crosses were backcrossed twice and 189 BC1 lines were genotyped. MAS was performed with Rht-Blb and Rht-Dlb specific markers, with SSR Xgwm261 being diagnostic for Rht8, and with a Ppd-Dl specific marker. During the first phase of selection corresponding chromosomes were screened with 48 SSRs for polymorphisms followed by the use of 3 to 5 polymorphic SSRs for the detection of recombination around these loci. Based on this procedure a total of 42 lines were selected for the selection phase two. 152 genome-wide SSRs had been screened among the parent lines, and from these a set of 80 polymorphic SSRs (4 per chromosome) was chosen for background fingerprinting of the 42 lines. This process is ongoing. We expect that Rht alleles will be quickly integrated into tall and high-yielding cultivars with excellent quantitative FHB resistance carrying only small chromosomal fragments of the Rht donor lines. Finally, in multi-location field trials these new lines will be tested to analyse the association of the three Rht genes and FHB susceptibility.

AB DNA markers near Fhb1, a major QTL for Fusarium head blight resistance on chromosome 3BS in wheat, were used to screen the Chinese Spring chromosome 3B BAC library, and a BAC contig spanning the Fhb1 region was constructed. The genic regions of two overlapping BAC clones were sequenced. Based on new DNA markers developed from the BAC sequences, Fhb1 was narrowed down to a 261 kb region with seven putative genes. The expression of the candidate genes was examined by RT-PCR. Four out of the seven genes are expressed in wheat spikes. But, there is no clear expression difference between water-inoculated and Fusarium-inoculated wheat spikes. Five cosmid clones containing all seven candidate genes were isolated from a cosmid library of Sumai 3. The cosmid clones were used to transform FHB-susceptible cultivar Bobwhite and transgenic plants were obtained for all cosmid clones. Transgenic plants for four out the five cosmid clones have been tested for Type II resistance to FHB, and none of them are resistant. FHB evaluation of the transgenic plants of the fifth cosmid clone is in progress. A highly diagnostic, codominant marker, UMN10 was developed and used for MAS for gene Fhb1.

AB Wangshuibai is an indigenous scab resistance germplasm originated from Jiangsu, China. To characterize the genetic basis of scab resistance in this germplasm, QTLs for type I and type II resistances were detected using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population created by single seed descent from Nanda2419 x Wangshuibai and a molecular marker map of more than 4000 cM constructed using RAPD, SSR and STS markers. The major QTLs for type I resistance in Wangshuibai were mapped to chromosomes 4BL and 5AS, and those for type II resistance were mapped to chromosomes 3BS. In addition, a QTL on chromosome 2B showed association with both types of resistance. These QTLs were verified with QTL near-isogenic lines. We found, by mapping QTLs for agronomical traits in the same population, that on chromosomes 4BL and 5AS the scab resistance QTLs co-locatcd with QTLs for plant height, thousand grain weight or flag leaf width. However, these associations could be break down by recombinant selection. We concluded that Wangshuibai is a valuable scab resistance gene resources and marker assisted selection would be of great help for its better utilization.

AB Crown freezing tolerance is the most important factor conferring oat (Avena spp.) winter hardiness. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for crown freezing tolerance in the 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population and to examine their relationship with other winter hardiness traits. One hundred thirty-five RILs were evaluated for crown freezing tolerance in a controlled environment. Previously published molecular marker and linkage map information was used for QTL detection. Seven QTL and four complementary epistatic interactions were identified that accounted for 56% of the phenotypic variation. Ogle contributed alleles for increased crown freezing tolerance at three loci, while Kanota contributed alleles for increased crown freezing tolerance at four loci. All loci where Kanota alleles increased crown freezing tolerance showed complementary epistasis for decreased crown freezing tolerance with the QTL near UMN13. Two of the major QTL identified were in the linkage groups (LG) associated with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 7C and 17, which was previously associated with spring growth habit in oat. The results confirm the importance of the chromosomes involved in the reciprocal 7C-17 translocation in controlling winter hardiness component traits.

TI Diagnostic microsatellite markers for the detection of stem rust

SO CROP SCIENCE

AB The wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr36, derived from Triticum timopheevi, confers a high level of resistance against a new race (TTKS, or commonly known as Ug99) and many other races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Because Sr36-virulent races exist, breeding for durable resistance would require pyramiding Sr36 with other genes, a process that can be facilitated by DNA markers. The aim of this study was to identify and validate microsatellite markers for the detection of Sr36 in wheat breeding programs. Two populations of 122 F-2 (LMPG x Sr36/9*LMPG) and 112 F-2 ('Chinese Spring' x W2691Sr36-1) were evaluated for stem rust reaction. Both populations exhibited distorted segregation with a preferential transmission of the Sr36-carrying segment. Three markers, Xstm773-2, Xgwm319, and Xwmc477, were in complete linkage with Sr36 in the LMPG x Sr36/9*LMPG population. In the Chinese Spring x W2691Sr36-1 population, Xgwm319 was 0.9 cM away from Xstm773-2, Xwmc477, and Sr36. These codominant markers were easy to score and diagnostic for Sr36 in a set of 76 wheat cultivars and breeding lines developed in 12 countries. Together, these markers can be used in marker-assisted selection of Sr36.

TI Characterization of inter-varietal chromosome substitution lines of
   wheat using molecular markers
SO CZECH JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING

DE wheat; substitution lines; SSR markers
ID TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; VRN LOCI
AB Several sets of wheat inter-varietal chromosome substitution lines (SLs) have been produced over the last fifty years at the CRI (formerly RICP) in Prague-Ruzyne, based on cytogenetic manipulations using aneuploids. Lines with defined genes have been obtained which significantly influence growth habit and flowering time and these have been used particularly in the study of the genetics and physiology of flowering. The sets of lines include substitutions of homoeologous group 5 chromosomes carrying Vrn genes that control vernalisation response, homoeologous group 2 chromosomes with Ppd genes controlling photoperiodic sensitivity, and some other substitutions, particularly those with chromosome 3B of the Czech alternative variety Ceska Presivka where a novel flowering time effect was located. Although the phenotypic and cytological analysis of substitution lines has been continually carried out during backcrossing generations, only the use of molecular markers can allow an unambiguous characterization to verify that substitutions are correct and complete. This analysis has allowed incorrect substitutions or partial substitutions to be identified and discarded. This paper summarizes the results of recent molecular checks of the substitution line collections at CRI.

AB Background/Aims: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-known type of dementia. However, it remains difficult to identify AD in the early stage and to distinguish it from other dementing disorders. We examined glycoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as potential biological markers of AD. Methods: CSF samples were collected from AD, other dementia and non-demented patients. Glycoproteins in CSF were detected by lectin blotting using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and sugar chain analysis was performed by isoelectric focusing. Results: In Alzheimer's CSF, several glycoproteins had lower WGA-binding activities, one of which was sufficiently sensitive and specific to distinguish AD from nondemented controls and other dementias. Further analysis identified this glycosylated protein as transferrin, and altered sugar chain composition of transferrin isoforms was observed despite normal protein levels in CSF. Conclusion: The decreased WGA-binding activity of transferrin in AD is probably due to altered glycosylation of transferrin molecules. Transferrin glycosylation is thus a potential biological marker for AD diagnosis, and changes in this glycosylation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of AD. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

AB In this research we established a particular vector-free and marker-free plant transformation system of maize to overcome the obstacles of biosafety limits. The BADH gene was introduced into maize by pollen-tube pathway, using the principle of minimum linear length of the transformation element, which was composed of only the BADH gene, expression regulatory sequence (35S CAMV promoter, NOS terminator), and T-DNA border sequence at both sides. Twenty-seven of 2076 transformed samples were positive in PCR amplification and the PCR positive rate of T-1 generation was 1.3%. Further Southern blotting results indicated that the BADH gene was integrated into maize genome. Transgenic lines of progeny were examined for tolerance to NaCl by induced salt stress with 250 mM NaCl Hoagland solution. After 15 days of treatment, 73.9-100% of the transgenic seedlings survived and grew well, whereas most wild-type seedlings wilted and showed loss of chlorophyll. Only 8.9% of the wild-type plants survived but gradually died after salt stress. The electrical conductivity of the transgenic line of progeny after salt stress was lower than wild type. The transgenic progeny had higher glycinebetaine and Chlorophyll content than wild type after salt stress.

AB Transgenesis is an important adjunct to classical plant breeding, in that it allows the targeted manipulation of specific characters using genes from a range of sources. The current status of crop transformation is reviewed, including methods of gene transfer, the selection of transformed plants and control of transgene expression. The application of genetic modification technology to specific traits is then discussed, including input traits relating to crop production (herbicide tolerance and resistance to insects, pathogens and abiotic stresses) and output traits relating to the composition and quality of the harvested organs. The latter include improving the nutritional quality for consumers as well as the improvement of functional properties for food processing.

AB The dark discoloration of the embryo end of barley grain (known as black point) is a physiological disorder and the discovery of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on 2H confirms this trait is controlled genetically. The mechanisms underlying black point tolerance can now be dissected through identification of candidate genes. Comparisons between the QTL identified on chromosomes 2H of barley and 2B of wheat suggest that they are in similar positions near the centromere. In silico analysis, using rice, identified genes residing on two comparative chromosomes (4 and 7) of the rice genome. Analysis of the 12.6Mb region revealed 1928 unique annotations classified into 11 functional categories. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with high sequence similarity to enzymes proposed to be involved in black point formation were used to develop restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). To ensure an even coverage of markers across the QTL, RFLP markers were also developed from other ESTs. Mapping of these markers has reduced the QTL region from 28 to 18 cM. This study has identified candidate genes for the control of black point formation and paves the way for future research to develop black point resistant barley cultivars.

AB Celiac disease is a common, familial autoimmune disease caused by exposure to gliadin in wheat, and related prolamins in barley and rye. The prevalence of the disease is approximately 1:133. Celiac disease can cause significant morbidity. The only treatment is a gluten-free diet. A genome-wide search of 405 microsatellite markers was performed on samples from 18 Bedouin families with a minimum of two cases of celiac disease. Non-parametric and parametric (including both dominant and recessive models of inheritance) linkage analyses were performed. The most significant genome-wide linkage evidence was at chromosome 3p26 with an HLod of 3.21, under the dominant model. The only other HLod or NPL greater than 2 was at 4q35, with an HLod of 2.15 under a dominant model. The region at 3p26, previously reported in two linkage analyses, harbors interleukin receptor genes, plausible candidates for celiac disease.

F 1 resistance was intermediate and suggested additive nature of inheritance. Three additive genes was noted in the distribution of F 3, F 4 and F 5 generations. In F(6) and F(6-7), the quantitative and qualitative approaches also suggested the control of three resistance genes. The parents and the RILs (F(6)/F(6-7)) were grown in four environments and spot blotch severity recorded. Forty five SSR primers, specific for chromosomes 1 (7H) and 5 (1H), were applied. Of these, 12 were polymorphic between the parents, and between the resistant and susceptible bulks. Three markers BMS 32, BMS 90 and HVCMA showed association with resistance, which was further confirmed through selective genotyping. The co-segregation data on the molecular markers (BMS 32, BMS 90 and HVCMA) and spot blotch severity on 173 RILs was analyzed by single marker linear regression approach. Significant regression suggested linkage among BMS 32, BMS 90 and HVCMA and the three resistant genes (designated as Rcs-qtl-5H-1, Rcs-qtl-5H-2 and Rcs-qtl-1H-1.) respectively. These markers explained 28%, 19% and 12% of variation respectively, for spot blotch resistance among the RILs.

AB A common wheat (Trilicum aestivum L.) mutation that produces 3 pistils (TP) per floret may result in formation of Lip to 3 kernels per floret. The TP trait may be important for increasing the number of grains per spike and for improving the yield potential through breeding. This trait is determined by the dominant Pis1 gene. Genetic mapping of Pis1 involved 234 microsatellite markers and bulk segregant analysis of a cross of the TP line with Novosibirskaya 67. The Pis1 gene is located on chromosome 2DL, between markers Xgwm539 and Xgwm349. This result does not agree with a previously published localization of the Pis1 gene on chromosome 5B. The possible importance of TP wheat as an alternative genetic resource is discussed.

AB Based on segregation distortion of simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers, we detected a significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance on the short arm of chromosome 2D (2DS) in the extremely susceptible population of F(2) progeny generated from the cross of PHS tolerant synthetic hexaploid wheat cultivar 'RSP' and PHS susceptible bread wheat cultivar '88-1643'. To identify the QTL of PHS tolerance, we constructed two SSR-based genetic maps of 2DS in 2004 and 2005. One putative QTL associated with PHS tolerance, designated Qphs.sau-2D, was identified within the marker intervals Xgwm261-Xgwm484 in 2004 and in the next year, nearly in the same position, between markers wmc112 and Xgwn1484. Confidence intervals based oil the LOD-drop-off method ranged from 9 cM to 15.4 cM and almost completely overlapped with marker interval Xgwm261-Xgwm484. Flanking markers near this QTL could be assigned to the C-2DS1-0.33 chromosome bin, suggesting that the gene(s) controlling PHS tolerance is located in that chromosome region. The phenotypic variation explained by this QTL was about 25.73-27.50%. Genotyping of 48 F(6) PHS tolerant plants derived from the cross between PHS tolerant wheat cultivar 'RSP' and PHS susceptible bread wheat cultivar 'MY11' showed that the allele of Qphs.sau-2D found in the 'RSP' genome may prove useful for the improvement of PHS tolerance.

AB Sets of triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) lines derived from the cv. Presto with HMW glutenin allele Glu-D1d (subunits 5+10) translocated from bread wheat (Triticum aestiuvum L.) chromosome ID to chromosome IR were evaluated for agronomic and grain quality characteristics in 2002-2005. Two different translocation types were used: (a) single translocation IR.ID5+10-2 where the long arm of IR carries the wheat segment from 1DL with the Glu-D1d replacing a secalin locus Sec-3, (b) double translocation Valdy where the long arm of I R has the translocation 1R.1D(5+10)-2 and the short arm has a segment from 1DS carrying wheat loci Gli-D1 and Glu-D3. The presence of Glu-D1d was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE-ISTA) and DNA markers. The tested lines of triticale were compared with the check triticale cv. Presto and with wheat cultivars of different bread making quality (E-C quality classes). Single translocation 1R.1D(5+10)-2 reduced grain yield by 16% and Valdy translocation by 24% as compared with cv. Presto. The Valdy translocation had substantially shortened spike length and reduced specific weight in comparison with check cv. Presto. Wet gluten content (according to the Perten method) was 12% in both translocation types, 8% in check Presto and on average 24% in wheat. Translocations increased the Zeleny sedimentation value (Valdy-27ml, 1R.1D(5+10)-2-25ml, cv. Presto-23ml). Triticale had a very low Hagbere falling number (FN) of 62-70s without significant differences, while wheat had on average 301s. The translocations did not significantly increase loaf volume; however, they improved loaf shape (height/width ratio): Valdy-0.61, 1R.1D(5+10)-2-0.56, cv. Presto 0.44. wheat on average 0.70. The dough was non-sticky in Valdy, slightly sticky in 1R.1D(5+10)-2 and sticky in cv. Presto. Problems with a low FN for improving bread making quality of triticale are discussed. Higher bread making quality can be influenced by appropriate combination with donors of low alpha-amylase activity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Piriformospora indica is a fungus of the order Sebacinales (Basidiomycota) infesting roots of mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Endophytic fungal colonization leads to enhanced plant growth while host cell. death is required for proliferation in differentiated root tissue to form a mutualistic interaction. Colonization of barley roots by P. indica and related Sebacina vermifera strains also leads to systemic resistance against the leaf pathogenic fungus Blumerio graminis f.sp. hordei due to a yet unknown mechanism of induced resistance. In order to elucidate plant response pathways governed by these root endophytes, we analyzed gene expression in barley plants exhibiting an established symbiosis with P. indica 3 weeks after inoculation. P. indica-cotonized roots showed no induction of defence-related genes, white other genes showed a differential regulation pattern indicating a faster P. indica-dependent root development. Gene expression analysis of leaves detected only few systemically induced mRNAs. Among differentially regulated transcripts, we characterized the pathogenesis-related gene HvPr17b and the molecular chaperone HvHsp70 in more detail. HvPr17b shows similarity with TaWC15, a wheat gene inducible by chemical resistance inducers and salicylate, and was previously proven to exhibit antifungal activity against B. graminis. HvHsp70 is the first gene found to systemically indicate root colonization with endophytic fungi of the order Sebocinales. Both genes are discussed as markers for endophytic colonization and resulting systemic responses. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Host plant resistance is an important strategy for managing root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) in cotton (Gossypium L.). Here we report evidence for enhanced resistance in interspecific crosses resulting from transgressive segregation of clustered gene loci. Recently, a major gene, rkn1, on chromosome 11 for resistance to M. incognita in cv. Acala NemX was identified using an intraspecific G. hirsutum cross with susceptible cv. Acala SJ-2. Using interspecific crosses of Acala NemX x susceptible G. barbadense cv. Pima S-7, F-1, F-2, F-2:3, backcross, and testcross Acala NemX x F-1 (Pima S-7 x SJ-2), parental entries and populations were inoculated in greenhouse tests with M. incognita. Genetic analyses based on nematode-induced root galling and nematode egg production on roots, and molecular marker analysis of the segregating interspecific populations revealed that gene rkn1 interacted with a gene (designated as RKN2) in susceptible Pima S-7 to produce a highly resistant phenotype. RKN2 did not confer resistance in Pima S-7, but when combined with rkn1 (genotype Aa or aa), high levels of resistance were produced in the F-1 and segregating F-2, F-3, and BC1F1 populations. One SSR marker MUCS088 was identified tightly linked to RKN2 within 4.4 cM in a NemX x F-1 (Pima S-7 x SJ-2) testcross population. Using mapped SSR markers and interspecific segregating populations, MUCS088 linked to the transgressive gene from the susceptible parent and was located in the vicinity of rkn1 on chromosome 11. Diverse genome analyses among A and D genome diploid and tetraploid cottons revealed that marker MUCS088 (165 and 167 bp) is derived from G. arboreum, A(2) diploid genome. These results demonstrated that a highly susceptible parent contributed to nematode resistance via transgressive segregation. Derived highly resistant lines can be used as improved resistance sources in cotton breeding, and MUCS088 can be used to monitor RKN2 introgression in diverse populations. The close genomic location of the transgressive resistance determinants provides an important model system for studying transgressive segregation and epistasis in plants.

ID INFORMATION RESOURCE; DATABASE; RICE; ARABIDOPSIS; DIVERSITY; PROJECT
AB Gramene (www.gramene.org) is a curated resource for genetic, genomic and comparative genomics data for the major crop species, including rice, maize, wheat and many other plant (mainly grass) species. Gramene is an open-source project. All data and software are freely downloadable through the ftp site (ftp.gramene.org/pub/gramene) and available for use without restriction. Gramenes core data types include genome assembly and annotations, other DNA/mRNA sequences, genetic and physical maps/markers, genes, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), proteins, ontologies, literature and comparative mappings. Since our last NAR publication 2 years ago, we have updated these data types to include new datasets and new connections among them. Completely new features include rice pathways for functional annotation of rice genes; genetic diversity data from rice, maize and wheat to show genetic variations among different germplasms; large-scale genome comparisons among Oryza sativa and its wild relatives for evolutionary studies; and the creation of orthologous gene sets and phylogenetic trees among rice, Arabidopsis thaliana, maize, poplar and several animal species (for reference purpose). We have significantly improved the web interface in order to provide a more user-friendly browsing experience, including a dropdown navigation menu system, unified web page for markers, genes, QTLs and proteins, and enhanced quick search functions.

AB BACKGROUND: Resistance gene analogues (RGAs) have been isolated from many crops and offer potential in breeding for disease resistance through marker-assisted selection, either as closely linked or as perfect markers. Many R-gene sequences contain kinase domains, and indeed kinase genes have been reported as being proximal to R-genes, making kinase analogues an additionally promising target. The first step towards utilizing RGAs as markers for disease resistance is isolation and characterization of the sequences.
   RESULTS: Sugarcane clone US01-1158 was identified as resistant to yellow leaf caused by the sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV) and moderately resistant to rust caused by Puccinia melanocephala Sydow & Sydow. Degenerate primers that had previously proved useful for isolating RGAs and kinase analogues in wheat and soybean were used to amplify DNA from sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) clone US-01-1158. Sequences generated from 1512 positive clones were assembled into 134 contigs of between two and 105 sequences. Comparison of the contig consensuses with the NCBI sequence database using BLASTx showed that 20 had sequence homology to nuclear binding site and leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) RGAs, and eight to kinase genes. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences with similar sequences from the NCBI database allowed the identification of several conserved domains. The alignment and resulting phenetic tree showed that many of the sequences had greater similarity to sequences from other species than to one another.

AB Stagonospora nodorum blotch, caused by Phaeosphaeria nodorum, is considered one of the most destructive foliar diseases of wheat in the United States. However, relatively little is known about the population biology of this fungus in the major wheat-growing regions of the central United States. To rectify this situation, 308 single-spore isolates of P. nodorum were analyzed from 12 populations, five from hard red spring wheat cultivars in Minnesota and North Dakota and seven from soft red winter wheat in Indiana and Ohio. The genetic structure of the sampled populations was determined by analyzing polymorphisms at five microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci and the mating type locus. Although a few clones were identified, most P. nodorum populations had high levels of gene (H(S) = 0.175 to 0.519) and genotype (D = 0.600 to 0.972) diversity. Gene diversity was higher among isolates collected from spring wheat cultivars in North Dakota and Minnesota (mean H(S) = 0.503) than in those from winter wheat cultivars in Indiana and Ohio (H(S) = 0.269). Analyses of clone-corrected data sets showed equal frequencies of both mating types in both regional and local populations, indicating that sexual recombination may occur regularly. However, significant gametic disequilibrium occurred in three of the four populations from North Dakota, and there was genetic differentiation both within and among locations. Genetic differentiation between the hard red spring and soft red winter wheat production regions was moderate (F(ST) = 0.168), but whether this is due to differences in wheat production or to geographical variation cannot be determined. These results suggest that sexual reproduction occurs in P. nodorum populations in the major wheat-growing regions of the central United States, and that geographically separated populations can be genetically differentiated, reflecting either restrictions on gene flow or selection.

AB Sustainable control of plant diseases can be achieved by developing cultivars with durable resistance. 'Bancroft' barley has durable high-temperature, adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei. The objectives of this study were to determine the inheritance of the HTAP resistance in Bancroft, develop molecular markers for the HTAP resistance using the resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique, map the HTAP resistance quantitative trait locus or loci (QTL) on barley chromosomes, and determine the usefulness of the RGAP markers in other barley cultivars for marker-assisted selection. The parents and F-4 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and the parents and F-5 RIL were evaluated in 2004 and 2005 in one and three field sites, respectively, in Washington State. Infection type (IT) and disease severity (DS) were recorded three times at each location during each growing season. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated for each parent and RIL based on the DS data. Genetic analyses of IT data of the parents, F-1, and F-2 tested in the adult-plant stage under controlled high-temperature cycle in the Greenhouse and the parents, F-4, and F-5 RIL in the field indicated that one dominant Gene controlled the HTAP resistance in Bancroft. Using 119 F-5:6 RIL and IT data, a linkage map on chromosome arm 3HL was constructed with eight RGAP markers and three simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Using the QTL analysis, a QTL for HTAP resistance was mapped with the DS and AUDPC data on the same chromosome location as with the IT data. The QTL explained >70% of the total phenotypic variation for the DS and AUDPC. The heritability of the HTAP resistance based on the AUDPC data was 76%. The two markers most close to the QTL peak detected polymorphisms in 84 and 88% of 25 barley genotypes that do not have the Bancroft HTAP resistance when used individually, and detected polymorphism in 100% of the genotypes when used in combination, indicating that the markers could be used in incorporating the HTAP resistance into these barley genotypes to improve the level and durability of resistance to stripe rust.

AB Common bunt and dwarf bunt caused by Tilletia caries (DC) Tul., T. foetida (Wallr) Llro. and T. controversa, respectively, can cause considerable yield and quality losses In wheat. Growing resistant cultivars Is the most economic and environmentally friendly option in bunt control, especially Important In organic agriculture systems. Bt10 Is one of the most effective bunt resistance genes, widely used In wheat breeding programs worldwide, including programs In Romania. We used the PCR marker developed by Laroche et al. (2000), to screen Romanian semidwarf winter lines for presence of Bt10 gene. The marker detected the presence of a specific 275 bp amplification product In PI 554118 and in one semidwarf line which has PI 554118 In Its pedigree, but not In any of the lines obtained from crosses involving PI 178383, carrier of Bt8 + Bt9 + Bt10 Presumably, Bt10 was eliminated during selection, either through genetic drift or because It might be associated with some unfavourable traits. Selection for bunt resistance only retained one or both other resistance genes present in PI 178383. Screening three lines In which bunt resistance genes could not be Identified from genealogies, showed that they do not carry Bt10. Further studies should demonstrate if they carry other known Bt genes, not obvious from their parentage, or they are Indeed carriers of new resistance genes.

AB Wheat is prone to strawbreaker foot rot (eyespot), a fungal disease caused by Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis. The most effective source of genetic resistance is Pch1, a gene derived from Aegilops ventricosa. The endopeptidase isozyme marker allele Ep-D1b, linked to Pch1, has been shown to be more effective for tracking resistance than DNA-based markers developed to date. Therefore, we sought to identify a candidate gene for Ep-D1 as a basis for a DNA-based marker. Comparative mapping suggested that the endopeptidase loci Ep-D1 (wheat), enp1 (maize), and Enp (rice) were orthologous. Since the product of the maize endopeptidase locus enp1 has been shown to exhibit biochemical properties similar to oligopeptidase B purified from E. coli, we reasoned that Ep-D1 may also encode an oligopeptidase B. Consistent with this hypothesis, a sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker, Xorw1, derived from an oligopeptidase B-encoding wheat expressed-sequence-tag (EST) showed complete linkage with Ep-D1 and Pch1 in a population of 254 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wheat cultivars Coda and Brundage. Two other STS markers, Xorw5 and Xorw6, and three microsatellite markers (Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175) were also completely linked to Pch1. On the other hand, Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175 showed recombination in the W7984 x Opata85 RIL population suggesting that recombination near Pch1 is reduced in the Coda/Brundage population. In a panel of 44 wheat varieties with known eyespot reactions, Xorw1, Xorw5, and Xorw6 were 100% accurate in predicting the presence or absence of Pch1 whereas Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175 were less effective. Thus, linkage mapping and a germplasm survey suggest that the STS markers identified here should be useful for indirect selection of Pch1.

AB Sequencing of a BAC clone encompassing the Glu-B1 locus in Glenlea, revealed a 10.3 Kb segmental duplication including the Bx7 gene and flanking an LTR retroelement. To better understand the evolution of this locus, two collections of wheat were surveyed. The first consisted of 96 diploid and tetraploid species accessions while the second consisted of 316 Triticum aestivum cultivars and landraces from 41 countries. The genotypes were first characterized by SDS-PAGE and a total of 40 of the 316 T. aestivum accessions were found to display the overexpressed Bx7 phenotype (Bx7(OE)). Three lines from the 96 diploid/tetraploid collection also displayed the stronger intensity staining characteristic of the Bx7(OE) subunit. The relative amounts of the Bx7 subunit to total HMW-GS were quantified by RP-HPLC for all Bx7(OE) accessions and a number of checks. The entire collection was assessed for the presence of four DNA markers namely an 18 bp indel of the coding region of Bx7 variant alleles, a 43 bp indel of the 5'-region and the left and right junctions of the LTR retrotransposon borders and the duplicated segment. All 43 accessions found to have the Bx7(OE) subunit by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC produced the four diagnostic PCR amplicons. None of the lines without the Bx7(OE) had the LTR retroelement/duplication genomic structure. However, the 18 and 43 bp indel were found in accessions other than Bx7(OE). These results indicate that the overexpression of the Bx7 HMW-GS is likely the result of a single event, i.e., a gene duplication at the Glu-B1 locus mediated by the insertion of a retroelement. Also, the 18 and 43 bp indels pre-date the duplication event. Allelic variants Bx7*, Bx7 with and without 43 bp insert and Bx7(OE) were found in both tetraploid and hexaploid collections and shared the same genomic organization. Though the possibility of introgression from T. aestivum to T. turgidum cannot be ruled out, the three structural genomic changes of the B-genome taken together support the hypothesis of multiple polyploidization events involving different tetraploid progenitors.

AB The 5S rRNA gene in higher eukaryotes is organized into repeated units of tandem array that comprise a conserved 120-bp coding region and a non-transcribed spacer (NTS) of variable length with nucleotides. The allotetraploid genome of Allium sacculiferum consists of two unknown diploids (2n=32). Analyses have not been successful toward clarifying the origin of each genome due to their similar chromosome morphology and unmatched C-banding patterns. We PCR-amplified the coding and NTS regions of its 5S rRNA genes, cloned them into vectors, and determined their DNA sequences. Interestingly, the aligned sequences of the NTS clones could be divided into two distinctive groups based on the existence of a 3-bp CCT insertion/deletion at the beginning of the NTS region. This feature makes it an important genetic marker for distinguishing the origin of the A. sacculiferum chromosomes. Furthermore, by applying fluorescence in situ hybridization, we located the 5S rRNA gene loci on Chromosomes 5, 7, 8, 9, and 14; their distribution is unique to A. sacculiferum. These data support the idea that one set of this genome has originated from a CCT-containing close relative -- A. deltoid-fistulosum -- and that the NTS region may be used as a molecular marker for identifying parental lines for the allotetraploidity of A. sacculiterum.

AB In the sea urchin embryo, primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) are committed early in development to direct skeletogenesis, provided that a permissive signal is conveyed from adjacent ectoderm cells. We showed that inhibition of extracellular matrix (ECM)-ectoderm cells interaction, by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to Pl-nectin, causes an impairment of skeletogenesis and reduced expression of Pl-SM30, a spicule-specific matrix protein. When PMCs are experimentally removed, some secondary mesenchyme cells (SMCs) switch to skeletogenic fate. Here, for the first time we studied SMC transfating in PMC-less embryos of Paracentrotus lividus. We observed the appearance of skeletogenic cells within 10 h of PMCs removal, as shown by binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to cell surface molecules unique to PMCs. Interestingly, the number of WGA-positive cells, expressing also msp130, another PMC-specific marker, doubled with respect to that of PMCs present in normal embryos, though the number of SM30-expressing cells remained constant. In addition, we investigated the ability of SMCs to direct skeletogenesis in embryos exposed to mAbs to Pl-nectin after removal of PMCs. We found that, although phenotypic SMC transfating occurred, spicule development, as well as Pl-SM30-expression was strongly inhibited. These results demonstrate that ectoderm inductive signals are necessary for transfated SMCs to express genes needed for skeletogenesis.

AB In order to analyse the genetic control of anther culture response in barley, a doubled-haploid (DH) population from the cross between a medium responsive cultivar 'Dobla' and the model cultivar 'Igri' was produced. A linkage map was constructed with 91 markers. A sub-population of 41 lines was characterised for different components of the anther culture response, and was used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. The vrs1 locus region on chromosome 2H, which determines inflorescence row type, was coincident with the largest putative QTL for number of embryos (nEMB) and albino plants. A region of chromosome 6H was associated with QTLs for nEMB and green plants. QTLs for number and percentage of green plants were located on the long arm of chromosome 5H. Therefore, new QTLs for main components of barley anther culture response were identified on chromosomes 2H, 5H and 6H, indicating that anther culture response in barley could be controlled by relative few genes of large effect. This work is a useful step towards the identification of new regions on the barley genome that could be associated with fundamental biological process implicated in the anther culture response.

AB The breeding companies and laboratories involved in this article cover a wide range of crops grown in the temperate climate zone: small grain cereals, oilseed crops, forage crops, turf, vegetables and potato. Speed and efficiency are becoming increasingly important in variety breeding and doubled haploids (DH) and genetic markers are important biotechnological tools to accelerate materials to market. Collaborative research between universities, research institutions and breeding companies has resulted in the routine use of DH technology and molecular markers in practical breeding of barley, wheat and rapeseed. DH populations have been established not only for barley, wheat and rapeseed, but for rye, oat and triticale, where DH technology is less developed. A driver here is the value of the crop e.g. although wheat is less responsive to DH production the value of the end product makes the effort worthwhile. Simple and rapid DNA extraction methods used in high-throughput marker assisted selection (MAS) systems are essential for routine use of markers. MAS is used both to monitor the presence of genes of interest and also to monitor the genetic background. DH technology in forage, turf and vegetables is still in progress and the practical use of markers in all crops is limited by access to trait linked markers. Collaboration and technology transfer with universities, research institutions and breeding companies is essential for the improvement of both DH protocols in recalcitrant crops and marker technology in all crops.

AB Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) constitute an abundant source of DNA polymorphisms, which have been successfully used to identify loci that are associated with a particular phenotype. Additionally, such markers could be efficiently used in combination with doubled haploid technology to improve the efficiency of breeding programmes. Information on such markers in plants is still scarce. For bread wheat, SNP data are restricted to a few genes. This can be explained by the hexaploidy of Triticum aestivum which makes SNP discovery difficult. We developed a novel method for SNP discovery in bread wheat. The strategy is based on the development of highly specific PCR-primers, which were used to sequence 27 lines. SNPs were discovered from sequence alignment data. Some SNPs were identified by mass spectrometry in a collection of 113 lines, which were both evaluated for agronomic traits and genotyped at 42 neutral microsatellite loci. Traits investigated include: protein content, the quantity of high-molecular-weight glutenins and that of the GluBx subunit. The 42 markers were used to infer population structure, which was included in linear models for association studies. The results of this preliminary study showed 89 SNPs in approximately 20 kbp, i.e., one SNP every 223 bp on average. Six SNPs were genotyped: three were located along the sequence of Glu-B1-1, while three non-synonymous SNPs were located along the sequence of the B homoeologous gene coding for SPA (Storage Protein Activator). The SNPs from Glu-B1-1 had a significant effect on the studied variables, whereas those of SPA had no effect. Such results might indicate that some haplotypes for Glu-B1-1 are linked to higher protein content, through an increased amount of high-molecular-weight glutenins, especially the GluBx subunit.

AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major root crop widely grown in the tropics. Cassava bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), is an important disease in Latin America and Africa resulting in significant losses. The preferred control method is the use of resistant genotypes. Mapping expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and determining their co-localization with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) may give additional evidence of the role of the corresponding genes in resistance or defense. Twenty-one EST-derived simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were mapped in 16 linkage groups. ESTs showing similarities with candidate resistance genes or defense genes were also mapped using strategies such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences, and allele-specific primers. In total, 10 defense-related genes and 2 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing resistance gene candidates (RGCs) were mapped in 11 linkage groups. Two new QTLs associated with resistance to Xam strains CIO121 and CIO151 were detected in linkage groups A and U, respectively. The QTL in linkage group U explained 61.6% of the phenotypic variance and was associated with an RGC-containing BAC. No correlation was found between the new EST-derived SSRs or other mapped ESTs and the new or previously reported QTLs.

AB An integrated genetic linkage map of the medicinal and ornamental plant Catharanthus roseus, based on different types of molecular and morphological markers was constructed, using a F-2 population of 144 plants. The map defines 14 linkage groups (LGs) and consists of 131 marker loci, including 125 molecular DNA markers (76 RAPD, 3 RAPD combinations; 7 ISSR; 2 EST-SSR from Medicago truncatula and 37 other PCR based DNA markers), selected from a total of 472 primers or primer pairs, and six morphological markers (stem pigmentation, leaf lamina pigmentation and shape, leaf petiole and pod size, and petal colour). The total map length is 1131.9 cM (centiMorgans), giving an average map length and distance between two markers equal to 80.9 cM and 8.6 cM, respectively. The morphological markers/genes were found linked with nearest molecular or morphological markers at distances varying from 0.7 to 11.4 cM. Linkage was observed between the morphological markers concerned with lamina shape and petiole size of leaf on LG1 and leaf, stem and petiole pigmentation and pod size on LG8. This is the first genetic linkage map of C. roseus.

AB Lignans are phenylpropane dimers that are biosynthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase (PLR) catalyzes the last steps of lignan production. Our previous studies demonstrated that the contents of lignans in various wheat cultivars were significantly associated with anti-tumor activities in APC(Min) mice. To enhance lignan biosynthesis, this study was conducted to transform wheat cultivars ('Bobwhite', 'Madison', and 'Fielder', respectively) with the Forsythia intermedia PLR gene under the regulatory control of maize ubiquitin promoter. Of 24 putative transgenic wheat lines, we successfully obtained 3 transformants with the inserted ubiquitin-PLR gene as screened by PCR. Southern blot analysis further demonstrated that different copies of the PLR gene up to 5 were carried out in their genomes. Furthermore, a real-time PCR indicated -17% increase of PLR gene expression over the control in 2 of the 3 positive transformants at To generation. The levels of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a prominent lignan in wheat as determined by HPLC-MS, were found to be 2.2-times higher in one of the three positive transgenic sub-lines at T-2 than that in the wild-type (117.9 +/- 4.5 vs. 52.9 +/- 19.8 mu g/g, p <0.005). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that elevated lignan levels in a transgenic wheat line has been successfully achieved through genetic engineering of over-expressed PLR gene. Although future studies are needed for a stably expression and more efficient transformants, the new wheat line with significantly higher SDG contents obtained from this study may have potential application in providing additive health benefits for cancer prevention.

AB Partial resistance to leaf rust (Puccinia hordei G. H. Otth) in barley is a quantitative resistance that is not based on hypersensitivity. This resistance hampers haustorium formation, resulting in a long latency period in greenhouse tests. The three most consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) uncovered in the L94 x 'Vada' mapping population were introgressed by marker-assisted backcrossing into the susceptible L94 background to obtain near-isogenic lines (NIL). We also developed the reciprocal Vada-NIL for the susceptibility alleles of those QTL. The QTL Rphq2 affected latency period of P. hordei more than the QTL Rphq3 and Rphq4. The NIL confirmed the contribution of Rphq2 to partial resistance by prolonging the latency period by 28 It on L94-Rphq2 and shortening the latency period by 23 It on Vada-rphq2. On the basis of flanking restriction fragment length polymorphism-based markers, Rphq2 appeared to be located near the telomeric end of the long arm of chromosome 211, in a physical region of high recombination, making it the target QTL for map-based cloning. Microscopic observations on the NIL confirmed the nonhypersensitive nature of the resistance conferred by Rphq2. A high-resolution genetic map of the Rphq2 region was constructed using a population of 38 subNIL with overlapping L94 introgressions in Vada background across the region. Rphq2 mapped approximatelly 2 centimorgans (cM) proximal from the MlLa locus. By bulked segregant analysis and use of synteny with rice, we developed additional markers and fine-mapped Rphq2 to a genetic interval of 0.11 cM that corresponds to a stretch of sequence of, at most, 70 kb in rice. Analysis of this rice sequence revealed predicted genes encoding two proteins with unknown function, retrotransposon proteins, peroxidase proteins, and a protein similar to a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K). Possible homologs of those peroxidases and MAP3K in barley are candidates for the gene that contributes to partial resistance to P. hordei.

AB A full-length cDNA (Hv-GR) whose transcript accumulation increased in response to infection by Blumeria graminis DC.f.sp. tritici (Bgt) was isolated from Haynaldia villosa. Southern analysis revealed a single copy of Hv-GR present in H. villosa. This gene encodes a glutathione reductase (GR) with high similarity to chloroplastic GRs from other plant species. Chloroplastic localization of Hv-GR was confirmed by targeting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Hv-GR fusion protein to chloroplasts of epidermal guard cells. Following inoculation with Bgt, transcript accumulation of Hv-GR increased in a resistant line of wheat, but no significant change was observed in a susceptible line. In vivo function of Hv-GR in converting oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to the reduced form (GSH) was verified through heterologous expression of Hv-GR in a yeast GR-deficient mutant. As expected, overexpression of this gene resulted in increased resistance of the mutant to H2O2, indicating a critical role for Hv-GR in protecting cells against oxidative stress. Moreover, overexpression of Hv-GR in a susceptible wheat variety, Triticum aestivum cv.Yangmai 158, enhanced resistance to powdery mildew and induced transcript accumulation of other pathogenesis-related genes, PR-1a and PR-5, through increasing the foliar GSH/GSSG ratio. Therefore, we concluded that a high ratio of GSH to GSSG is required for wheat defense against Bgt, and that chloroplastic GR enzymes might serve as a redox mediator for NPR1 activation.

AB Genetic transformation of crop plants offers the possibility of testing hypotheses about the function of individual genes as well as the exploitation of transgenes for targeted trait improvement. However, in most cereals, this option has long been compromised by tedious and low-efficiency transformation protocols, as well as by the lack of versatile vector systems. After having adopted and further improved the protocols for Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation of barley ( Hordeum vulgare) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum), we now present a versatile set of binary vectors for transgene overexpression, as well as for gene silencing by double-stranded RNA interference. The vector set is offered with a series of functionally validated promoters and allows for rapid integration of the desired genes or gene fragments by GATEWAY-based recombination. Additional in-built flexibility lies in the choice of plant selectable markers, cassette orientation, and simple integration of further promoters to drive specific expression of genes of interest. Functionality of the cereal vector set has been demonstrated by transient as well as stable transformation experiments for transgene overexpression, as well as for targeted gene silencing in barley.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB or scab) caused by Fusarium species is a destructive disease in wheat and barley worldwide. The objectives of our study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to FHB spread ( Type II resistance) and to quantify the magnitude of their effects in a novel highly resistant wheat germ-plasm, CJ 9306. A set of 152 F-7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross Veery/CJ 9306 and two parents were evaluated for FHB resistance by single-floret inoculation in three greenhouse experiments in 2002 and 2004. Percentage (PSS) and number (NSS) of scabby spikelets at 25 days post-inoculation were analyzed. In total 682 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened for polymorphism between the two parents, and a genetic linkage map was constructed with 208 polymorphic markers. Ten QTLs associated with FHB resistance were detected, five from CJ 9306 and five from Veery. The major QTL on 3BS (QFhs.ndsu-3BS) was validated in CJ 9306, exhibiting greatest additive effects and explained 30.7% of phenotypic variation for PSS on the overall average of three experiments. Another major QTL on 2DL (QFhs.nau-2DL) from CJ 9306 explained 9.9-28.4% of phenotypic variation, with a significant QTL x environment interaction. QFhs.nau-1AS and QFhs.nau-7BS showed lower additive effects and explained lower variance (4.5-9.5%). A QTL on 5AS, decreasing PSS by 10.3% on average, was validated by simple marker analysis and joint trait/experiment IM/CIM analysis despite insignificance for single-experiment IM and CIM analyses. Likewise, QFhs.nau-2BL and QFhs.nau-1BC from Veery could reduce PSS by 13.2 and 11.4%, respectively. The effects of other three minor QTLs from Veery were significant for one experiment and combined analysis. Comparisons of two- and three-locus combinations suggested that the effects of FHB resistance QTLs/genes could be accumulated, and the resistance could be feasibly enhanced by selection of favorable alleles for multiple loci. Four two- locus combinations and two three-locus combinations were suggested as the preferential choices in practical marker-assisted selection program.

AB Rusts and barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) are among the main diseases affecting wheat production world wide for which wild relatives have been the source of a number of translocations carrying resistance genes. Nevertheless, along with desirable traits, alien translocations often carry deleterious genes. We have generated recombinants in a bread wheat background between two alien translocations: TC5, ex-Thinopyrum (Th) intermedium, carrying BYDV resistance gene Bdv2; and T4m, ex-Th. ponticum, carrying rust resistance genes Lr19 and Sr25. Because both these translocations are on the wheat chromosome arm 7DL, homoeologous recombination was attempted in the double hemizygote (TC5/T4m) in a background homozygous for the ph1b mutation. The identification of recombinants was facilitated by the use of newly developed molecular markers for each of the alien genomes represented in the two translocations and by studying derived F-2, F-3 and doubled haploid populations. The occurrence of recombination was confirmed with molecular markers and bioassays on families of testcrosses between putative recombinants and bread wheat, and in F2 populations derived from the testcrosses. As a consequence it has been possible to derive a genetic map of markers and resistance genes on these previously fixed alien linkage blocks. We have obtained fertile progeny carrying new tri-genomic recombinant chromosomes. Furthermore we have demonstrated that some of the recombinants carried resistance genes Lr19 and Bdv2 yet lacked the self-elimination trait associated with shortened T4 segments. We have also shown that the recombinant translocations are fixed and stable once removed from the influence of the ph1b. The molecular markers developed in this study will facilitate selection of individuals carrying recombinant Th. intermedium-Th. ponticum translocations (Pontin series) in breeding programs.

AB Septoria tritici blotch, caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat in much of the world. Susceptibility of host plants to septoria was investigated by cytogenetic analysis. A line of Hobbit sib ( Dwarf A) in which translocated chromosome 5BS-7BS was nominally substituted by chromosome arms 5BS and 7BS from Bezostaya 1 had a much lower mean level of septoria than Hobbit sib itself. By the use of microsatellite markers, it was shown that the 5BS arm of this line had in fact been substituted by the homologous arm of Chinese Spring. Further investigation of substitution and nullitetrasomic lines demonstrated that chromosome arm 5BS of Hobbit sib possesses genes, which either promote susceptibility to septoria or suppress resistance. This chromosome arm has previously been shown to carry genes for resistance to yellow ( stripe) rust and powdery mildew, implying a trade-off between resistances to these two diseases and to septoria in wheat breeding. Bezostaya 1 was found to have specific resistance to M. graminicola isolate IPO323, probably controlled by the gene Stb6 on chromosome arm 3AS, present in numerous wheat cultivars. It also had partial resistance to septoria distributed over several chromosomes, which may explain the value of this cultivar as a source of septoria resistance.

AB During the domestication of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), evolutionary modifications that took place in seed dispersal mechanisms enhanced its suitability for agricultural production. One of these modifications involved the evolution of the free-threshing or hulless characteristic. In this study, we studied quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting components of the free-threshing habit (threshability and glume tenacity) on chromosome 2D in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed by the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) as well as the tenacious glumes 1 (Tg1) gene in F-2 progeny (CS/CS2D F2) of a cross between Chinese Spring and the 2D2 substitution line [Chinese Spring (Ae. tauschii 2D)]. In the ITMI population, two QTL affected threshability (QFt.orst-2D.1 and QFt.orst-2D.2) and their location coincided with QTL affecting glume tenacity (QGt.orst-2D.1 and QGt.orst-2D.2). In the CS/CS2D F2 population, the location of QTL that affected glume tenacity (QGt.orst-2D.1), the size of a glume base scar after detachment (QGba.orst-2D), and Tg1 (12-cM interval between Xwmc112 and Xbarc168) also coincided. Map comparisons suggest that QFt-orst-2D.1, QGt.orst-2D.1, and QGba.orst-2D correspond to Tg1 whereas QFt.orst-2D. 2 and QGt.orst-2D.2 appear to represent separate loci. The observation of coincident QTL for threshability and glume tenacity suggests that threshability is a function of glume adherence. In addition, the observation of the coincident locations of Tg1 and QTL for the force required to detach a glume and the size of a glume base scar after detachment suggests that Tg1's effect on both glume tenacity and threshability resides on its ability to alter the level of physical attachment of glumes to the rachilla of a spikelet.

AB Microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure in four populations of Elymus trachycaulus from British Columbia and one population of Elymus alaskanus from Northwest Territories. Fourteen microsatellite loci were used in this study. Our results indicated that E. trachycaulus is highly polymorphic, with an average percentage of polymorphic loci of 96.5% over the four populations. Average expected heterozygosity values (H-E or gene diversity) varied from 0.418 to 0.585 with a mean of 0.497. Most of the genetic variation was found within populations (85%) and the differentiation among populations was found to be 15% (F-st = 0.15). Interpopulation genetic distances corresponded well with the geographic distance between the population sites of origin, as well as morphological characteristics. Tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for all loci and all populations revealed that all loci significantly differ from HWE. Subsequent analysis indicated that departure from HWE at some loci was due to an excess of heterozygotes. Possible explanations for heterozygote excess are discussed. The most likely reason for observed heterozygote excess could be due to the polyploidy nature of the species. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major fungal disease caused by Blumeria graminis DC f. sp. tritici. A microsatellite linkage map was developed for the T. monococcum-derived powdery mildew resistant gene present in the North Carolina germplasm line NCB-GT96A6 (NCA6). Genetic analysis of F-2-derived lines from the cross NCA6 x 'Saluda' indicated a single gene controlled powdery mildew resistance. Four microsatellite markers linked to the NCA6 Pm gene mapped to chromosome 7AL. The most likely order was Xcfa2123-0.9 cm-Xbarc121-1.7 cM resistance gene/Xcfa2019-3.0 cM-Xgwm332. A detached-leaf test indicated the disease reaction response of the NCA6 Pm gene was different from the five known alleles at the Pm1 locus on 7AL. Deletion interval mapping showed a large physical to genetic distance ratio for these microsatellite marker loci. This may be due to suppressed recombination between the introgressed T. monococcum segment and the homologous region of the T. aestivum cultivar Saluda. Our results suggested that the NCA6 Pm gene is likely a novel source of resistance to powdery mildew but additional allelism studies are needed to establish the relationship between this locus and the other known Pm loci on 7AL.

AB Microsatellite marker locus Xgwm 261 has been associated with reduced plant height attributed to the linked gibberellic acid (GA) sensitive Rht8c allele in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Our objective was to determine effects of allelic variation at the Xgwm 261 and Rht-B1 loci in two winter wheat recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. 'Longhorn'/'Akron' and Longhorn/'Yuma' RIL populations were evaluated in controlled environments for GA sensitivity and coleoptile length and were grown in Colorado at five locations for 2 yr for agronomic evaluation. Microsatellite markers were used to identify alleles at the Xgwm 261 and Rht-B1 loci. In both populations, the Rht-B1b class showed reduced plant height (8.9% average), GA sensitivity (average 73.5%), coleoptile length (average 11.3%), and test weight (average 1.9%) relative to the Rht-B1a class. In the Longhorn/Yuma population, Rht-B1b and Xgwm 261 165-bp classes were shorter than the Xgwm 261 210-bp and Rht-B1a classes. Increased GA sensitivity and coleoptile length of the Xgwm 261 165-bp class were observed, although only in the Rht-B1a background. Plant height of the Xgwm 261 165-bp + Rht-B1a combination was intermediate to the shorter Xgwm 261 165-bp + Rht-B1b and the taller Xgwm 261-210-bp + Rht-B1a combinations. No negative associations attributed to the Xgwm 261 165-bp allele were observed. Our results suggest that the Xgwm 261 165-bp allele may provide reduced plant height, increased coleoptile length, and increased test weight when combined in a background with the Rht-B1a allele.

AB Transformation of maize (Zea mays L.) splitseed explants from inbred line R23 was performed following particle bombardment with a construct carrying the Arabidopsis transcriptional factor CBF3 under the control of the inducible promoter rd29A and the selectable marker hygromycin phosphotransferase. Overexpressing CBF3 has been shown to enhance cold, drought, and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The CBF3 gene was detected in 18 lines by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and stable integration of multiple copies of CBF3 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis in three selected lines. Reverse transcription PCR detected expression of CBF3 in the transgenic lines under unstressed conditions despite the use of the stress-inducible rd29A promoter. This constitutive expression was associated with growth retardation and sterility in most of the transgenic lines. Transmission of the gene in a Mendelian fashion to T-1 and T-2 generations was confirmed in one line by Southern blot analysis. Plants of this line showed stress-inducible expression of the CBF3 gene and hardly detectable expression under unstressed conditions along with significant tolerance to cold, drought, and salinity compared with wild-type plants. These results demonstrate that stress-inducible overexpression of CBF3 has the potential to enhance abiotic stress tolerance in corn.

AB Russian wheat aphid (RWA) [Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)] is an important pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in several production areas of the world. The most effective and economical approach for controlling RWA is to use resistant cultivars. A wheat line, ST-ARS 02RWA2414-11 (2414-11), showed a high level of resistance to RWA biotype 2. Our objectives were to map the resistance gene and develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS). A mapping population of 212 F-2 individuals was developed from a cross of 2414-11 and the susceptible cultivar Yuma. The F-2 individuals and F-2:3 families were infested using biotype 2 RWA. The RWA resistance of 2414-11 is controlled by a single major gene, provisionally designated as Dn2414. Using standard PCR, 30 marker loci were found to be linked to Dn2414 with recombination frequencies (theta) of 0.00 to 0.27 and logarithm of the odds to the base 10 (LOD) scores of 7.6 to 66.1. Of the 30 markers, 26 were tightly linked to Dn2414 with theta <= 0.05. A genetic map was constructed consisting of 31 loci spanning a region of 34.7 cM. The close linkage of Dn2414 with several rye chromosome 1R short arm (1RS)-specific simple sequence repeat markers and low theta values around the Dn2414 gene indicate that Dn2414 is located on chromosome 1RS.1BL (translocation chromosome with IRS and wheat chromosome 113 long arm), Phenotypic and marker profiles of 2414-11 and its relatives are the same as other lines known to carry Dn7. The Dn2414 gene is thus located on 1RS arm, and the large number of PCR markers will be valuable for MAS of this gene.

AB New sources of resistance to crown rust, Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Eriks.), the major fungal disease of cultivated oat, Avena sativa L. (2n = 6x = 42), are constantly needed due to frequent, rapid shifts in the virulence pattern of the pathogen. Crown rust resistance identified in the diploid oat A. strigosa (Schreb.) (2n = 2x = 14) accession CI6954SP was transferred into cultivated oat using two methods: direct cross of the diploid to a hexaploid cultivar facilitated by embryo rescue, and initial cross of the diploid to a wild tetraploid oat to make a synthetic hexaploid for subsequent crossing to a hexaploid cultivar. Two tetraploids, a crown rust resistant A. murphyi (Ladiz.) accession P12 and a susceptible A. insularis (Ladiz.) accession INS-1, were used in the 2x center dot 4x crosses. Resistant backcross-derived lines were recovered by both methods. Although the 2x center dot 4x synthetic method did not require the laborious discovery and rescue of an infrequent initial hybrid embryo of the direct cross, the direct cross method provided more rapid backcross recovery of plants with high fertility, full transmission of resistance, and desired plant and seed phenotypes. A suppressor effect, present initially but segregating in backcrosses, appeared to come from the CI6954SP donor and is the same as, or analogous to, suppression by an oat line with the crown rust resistance gene Pc38. No resistance from A. murphyi P12 was detected in advanced generations when it was introduced either as a component of a synthetic hexaploid or in direct crosses to A. sativa, indicating suppression of its resistance in interploidy combinations. That the dominant resistance gene transferred from CI6954SP and a gene Pc94 introgressed earlier from a different A. strigosa accession may be the same or quite similar to one another is indicated by their in-common specificity to suppression of resistance expression, susceptibility to a newly recovered rust isolate, and close linkage to the molecular marker SCAR94-2. The introgressed resistance genes from the different sources, even if the same, may have different cultivar genomic introgression sites, which would allow tests of dosage effects on resistance expression.

AB Pm12, transferred from Aegilops speltoides (2n = 2x = 14, genome SS) to wheat, confers effective resistance to powdery mildew worldwide. By applying bulked segregant analysis in a BC3F2 segregating population consisting of 305 plants, 18 wheat genomic and EST-SSR markers linked to the resistance gene were identified. Pm12 was located in the 6SS portion of the T6BS-6SS.6SL translocation chromosome based on the physical bin positions of the genomic and EST-SSR markers in the Chinese Spring group six deletion stocks and their linkage relationship to the resistance gene. Twenty eight recombinants among 305 F-2 plants indicated a low frequency of recombination between the alien chromosome segment and wheat chromosome 6B. Since recombination events occurred on both sides of Pm12, the materials generated provide opportunities for further reduction of alien chromatin by intercrossing selected individuals and using markers to select the required plants.

AB For millennia, wheat (Triticum spp.) has been grown in traditional aflaj-irrigation systems of remote mountain oases in Oman. However, little is known about the diversity of the ancient landraces used. Given recent reports about the occurrence of novel germplasm in such material, the objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landraces in relation to their geographic origin using microsatellites. The collection covered most of the cultivation areas in northern Oman where wheat landraces are growing. Total genomic DNA was extracted from six pooled plants representing each accession. A total of 161 wheat accessions were assayed using 35 microsatellite loci in which a total of 305 polymorphic bands were recorded for the 35 microsatellites. The polymorphic information content (PIC) across the 35 microsatellite loci ranged from 0.02 to 0.89 with an average of 0.50. A heterozygosity percentage value of 9.09 was determined and the highest level recorded for accessions from the Batinah district. Rare alleles averaged 1.85 with the highest value being from the Dakhilia district. The results indicated a significant correlation between gene diversity and number of alleles across districts. The correlation coefficient between these two variables over the 35 loci was 0.657, whereby correlation coefficients of 0.718, 0.706, 0.657 and 0.651, respectively, were found for the Batinah, Dhahira, Dakhilia and Sharqia materials. Genetic distances indicated that all landraces were closely related. The cluster analysis discriminated most of the landraces accessions. However, it failed to achieve region-specific groupings of landraces. The present study demonstrated the presence of high diversity in Omani landraces and also indicated the effectiveness of microsatellites to describe it.

AB The aim of the present study was to assess the genetic variation in several Israeli and Turkish populations of wild emmer wheat, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, the progenitor of most domesticated wheat. Single spikes were collected in 2002 from 60 plants that grew in six different habitats in Ammiad, northeastern Israel (8-12 plants from each habitat), and in 1998 from 56 plants that grew in seven different habitats in Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey (8 plants from each habitat). Seeds were planted in a nursery and DNA was extracted from every plant and analyzed by the fluorescent-based amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method. Seven primer combinations produced 788 discernible loci of which 48.6% were polymorphic in Israel and 40.5% in Turkey. The genetic diversity estimates P (frequency of polymorphic loci) and He (gene diversity) were higher in Ammiad than in Diyarbakir (means of P = 0.34 and He = 0.13 in Ammiad vs. P = 0.20 and He = 0.08 in Diyarbakir). Ammiad populations contained more unique alleles than Diyarbakir populations. The relative genetic diversity estimates (theta) values were 0.188 in Ammiad and 0.407 in Diyarbakir, suggesting better differentiation of the populations in Turkey. Genetic distance was larger between Israeli and Turkish populations than between populations of each country. The data indicate that the Israeli and Turkish populations are considerably diverged and that the Israeli populations are more polymorphic than the Turkish ones, having a larger within-populations genetic variation than among-populations one. The significance of the results in relation to the differentiation pattern of wild emmer in the Near East is discussed.

AB Defense response genes in higher plant species are involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways and biochemical reactions to counterattack invading pathogens. In this study, a total of 366 non- redundant defense response gene homologs ( DRHs), including 124 unigenes/expressed sequence tags, 226 tentative consensuses, and 16 DRH contigs have been identified by mining the Maize Genetics and Genomics and The Institute for Genomic Research maize databases using 35 essential defense response genes. Of 366 DRHs, 202 are mapped to 152 loci across ten maize chromosomes via both the genetic and in silico mapping approaches. The mapped DRHs seem to cluster together rather than be evenly distributed along the maize genome. Approximately half of these DHRs are located in regions harboring either major resistance genes or quantitative trait loci ( QTL). Therefore, this comprehensive DRH linkage map will provide reference sequences to identify either positional candidate genes for resistance genes and/or QTLs or to develop makers for fine-mapping and marker-assisted selection of resistance genes and/or QTLs.

AB A number of useful marker-trait associations have been reported for wheat. However the number of publications detailing the integrated and pragmatic use of molecular markers in wheat breeding is limited. A previous report by some of these authors showed how marker-assisted selection could increase the genetic gain and economic efficiency of a specific breeding strategy. Here, we present a practical validation of that study. The target of this breeding strategy was to produce wheat lines derived from an elite Australian cultivar `Stylet', with superior dough properties and durable rust resistance donated from `Annuello'. Molecular markers were used to screen a BC1F1 population produced from a cross between the recurrent parent `Stylet' and the donor parent `Annuello' for the presence of rust resistance genes Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29. Following this, marker-assisted selection was applied to haploid plants, prior to chromosome doubling with cochicine, for the rust resistance genes Lr24/Sr24, Lr34/Yr18, height reducing genes, and for the grain protein genes Glu-D1 and Glu-A3. In general, results from this study agreed with those of the simulation study. Genetic improvement for rust resistance was greatest when marker selection was applied on BC1F1 individuals. Introgression of both the Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29 loci into the susceptible recurrent parent background resulted in substantial improvement in leaf rust and stripe rust resistance levels. Selection for favourable glutenin alleles significantly improved dough resistance and dough extensibility. Marker-assisted selection for improved grain yield, through the selection of recurrent parent genome using anonymous markers, only marginally improved grain yield at one of the five sites used for grain yield assessment. In summary, the integration of marker-assisted selection for specific target genes, particularly at the early stages of a breeding programme, is likely to substantially increase genetic improvement in wheat.

AB The effects of evolutionary processes in fungal pathogen populations may occur more rapidly and display larger effects in agricultural systems than in wild ecosystems because of human involvement by plant breeding and crop management. In this study, we analysed the rate of evolution in three lineages of a northwest European population of a biotrophic and asexual reproduced fungal pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, causing yellow rust on wheat. Pathogen samples were collected between 1975 and 2002 in the UK and Denmark, and assayed for 14 individual avirulence/virulence alleles and up to 234 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs producing approximately 17 000 AFLP fragments. The large number of fragments and a targeted sampling of isolates allowed a reconstruction of phylogenies in great detail, i.e. no homoplasy and a representation of sequential, evolutionary steps by pathogen samples. A recent, phenotypic loss of avirulence was observed at least once for loci corresponding to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici resistance Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr7, Yr9, and Yr15, whereas Avr6 and Avr17 were lost independently in all three lineages, corresponding to 16 events of loss of avirulence (emergence of virulence). The opposite process, restoration of avirulence, was observed for Yr9 and Yr32. An interpretation of phenotypic changes within lineages as independent mutation events resulted in mutation frequencies from 1.4 x 10(-6) to 4.1 x 10(-6) per AFLP fragment (locus) per generation, whereas the effective rate by which a mutation from avirulence to virulence was established in the pathogen population, when subject to selection by host resistance genes, was approximately three orders of magnitude faster.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat reduces the quality of wheat grain, and improving PHS tolerance is a priority in certain wheat growing regions where conditions favorable for PHS exist. Two new Viviparous-1 allelic variants related to PHS tolerance were investigated on B genome of bread wheat, and designated as Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc had an insertion of 193-bp and a deletion of 83-bp fragment, respectively, located in the third intron region of the Vp-1B gene. The insertion and deletion affected the expression level of the Vp1 at mature seed stage, more correctly spliced transcripts were observed from the genotypes with either insertion or deletion than that of the wild type. Based on these insertions and deletions, a co-dominant STS marker of Vp-1B gene was developed and designated as Vp1B3, which in most cases could amplify either 845 or 569-bp fragment from the tolerant cultivars, and 652-bp from the susceptible ones. This Vp1B3 marker was mapped to chromosome 3BL using a set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines. A total of 89 white-grained Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines, were used to validate the relationship between the polymorphic fragments of Vp1B3 and PHS tolerance. Statistical analysis indicated that Vp1B3 was strongly associated with PHS tolerance in this set of Chinese germplasm, suggesting that Vp1B3 could be used as an efficient and reliable co-dominant marker in the evaluation of wheat germplasm for PHS tolerance and marker-assisted breeding for PHS tolerant cultivars.

AB In barley, variation in the requirement for vernalization (an extended period of low temperature before flowering can occur) is determined by the VRN-H1, -H2 and -H3 loci. In European cultivated germplasm, most variation in vernalization requirement is accounted for by alleles at VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 only, but the range of allelic variation is largely unexplored. Here we characterise VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 haplotypes in 429 varieties representing a large portion of the acreage sown to barley in Western Europe over the last 60 years. Analysis of genotype, intron I sequencing data and growth habit tests identified three novel VRN-H1 alleles and determined the most frequent VRN-H1 intron I rearrangements. Combined analysis of VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 alleles resulted in the classification of seventeen VRN-H1/VRN-H2 multi-locus haplotypes, three of which account for 79% of varieties. The molecular markers employed here represent powerful diagnostic tools for prediction of growth habit and assessment of varietal purity. These markers will also allow development of germplasm to test the behaviour of individual alleles with the aim of understanding the relationship between allelic variation and adaptation to specific agri-environments.

AB The grain yield of wheat is influenced by genotype, environment and genotype-by-environment interaction. A mapping population consisting of 182 doubled haploid progeny derived from a cross between the southern Australian varieties 'Trident' and 'Molineux', was used to characterise the interaction of previously mapped grain yield quantitative trait locus (QTL) with specific environmental covariables. Environments (17) used for grain yield assessment were characterised for latitude, rainfall, various temperature-based variables and stripe rust infection severity. The number of days in the growing season in which the maximum temperature exceeded 30 degrees C was identified as the variable with the largest effect on site mean grain yield. However, the greatest QTL-by-environmental covariable interactions were observed with the severity of stripe rust infection. The rust resistance allele at the Lr37/Sr38/Yr17 locus had the greatest positive effect on grain yield when an environment experienced a combination of high-stripe rust infection and cool days. The grain yield QTL, QGyld.agt-4D, showed a very similar QTL-by-environment covariable interaction pattern to the Lr37/Sr38/Yr17 locus, suggesting a possible role in rust resistance or tolerance. Another putative grain yield per se QTL, QGyld.agt-1B, displayed interactions with the quantity of winter and spring rainfall, the number of days in which the maximum temperature exceeded 30 degrees C, and the number of days with a minimum temperature below 10 degrees C. However, no cross-over interaction effect was observed for this locus, and the 'Molineux' allele remained associated with higher grain yield in response to all environmental covariables. The results presented here confirm that QGyld.agt-1B may be a prime candidate for marker-assisted selection for improved grain yield and wide adaptation in wheat. The benefit of analysing the interaction of QTL and environmental covariables, such as employed here, is discussed.

AB Grain yield forms one of the key economic drivers behind a successful wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping enterprise and is consequently a major target for wheat breeding programmes. However, due to its complex nature, little is known regarding the genetic control of grain yield. A doubled-haploid population, comprising 182 individuals, produced from a cross between two cultivars 'Trident' and 'Molineux', was used to construct a linkage map based largely on microsatellite molecular makers. 'Trident' represents a lineage of wheat varieties from southern Australia that has achieved consistently high relative grain yield across a range of environments. In comparison, 'Molineux' would be rated as a variety with low to moderate grain yield. The doubled-haploid population was grown from 2002 to 2005 in replicated field experiments at a range of environments across the southern Australian wheat belt. In total, grain yield data were recorded for the population at 18 site-year combinations. Grain yield components were also measured at three of these environments. Many loci previously found to be involved in the control of plant It height, rust resistance and ear-emergence were found to influence grain yield and grain yield components in this population. An additional nine QTL, apparently unrelated to these traits, were also associated with grain yield. A QTL associated with grain yield on chromosome 1B, with no significant relationship with plant height, ear-emergence or rust resistance, was detected (LOD >= 2) at eight of the 18 environments. The mean yield, across 18 environments, of individuals carrying the 'Molineux' allele at the 1B locus was 4.8% higher than the mean grain yield of those lines carrying the 'Trident' allele at this locus. Another QTL identified on chromosome 4D was also associated with overall gain yield at six of the 18 environments. Of the nine grain yield QTL not shown to be associated with plant height, phenology or rust resistance, two were located near QTL associated with grain yield components. A third QTL, associated with grain yield components at each of the environments used for testing, was located on chromosome 7D. However, this QTL was not associated with grain yield at any of the environments. The implications of these findings on marker-assisted selection for grain yield are discussed.

AB Barley is an economically important model for the Triticeae tribe. We recently developed a new resource: the 'Nure' x 'Tremois' mapping population. Two low temperature QTLs were found to segregate on the long arm of chromosome 5H (Fr-H1, distal; Fr-H2, proximal). With the final aim of positional cloning of the genetic determinants of Fr-H1 and Fr-H2, a large segregating population of 1,849 F-2 plants between parents 'Nure' and 'Tremois' was prepared. These two QT loci were first validated by using a set of F-3 families, marker-selected to harbor pairs of reciprocal haplotypes, with one QTL fixed at homozygosity and the alternate one in heterozygous phase. The study was then focused towards the isolation of the determinant of Fr-H2. Subsequent recombinant screens and phenotypic evaluation of F-4 segregants allowed us to estimate (P <= 0.01) a refined genomic interval of Fr-H2 (4.6 cM). Several barley genes with the CBF transcription factor signature had been already roughly mapped in cluster at Fr-H2, and they represent likely candidate genes underlying this QTL. Using the large segregating population (3,698 gametes) a high-resolution genetic map of the HvCBF gene cluster was then constructed, and after fine mapping, six recombinations between the HvCBFs were observed. It was therefore possible to genetically divide seven HvCBF subclusters in barley, in a region spanning 0.81 cM, with distances among them varying from 0.03 to 0.32 cM. The few recombinants between the different HvCBF subclusters are being marker-selected and taken to homozygosity, to phenotypically separate the effects of the single HvCBF genes.

AB The cultivation of wheat varieties resistant to Fusarium head blight (FHB) is recognized as one of the most important components to diminish losses due to this disease. Although there is no known immunity to this disease in wheat germplasm, considerable improvements in genetic resistance have been achieved by concentrated breeding efforts that have relied primarily upon repeated field and greenhouse-based screening. DNA markers are a relatively new technology that can be used to increase breeding progress, especially for traits such as FHB that are difficult to select for under field conditions and that are controlled by multiple genes. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) uses markers to select for particular DNA segments that are genetically linked to genes that provide incremental resistance to FHB. One particular gene, designated Fhbl, provides a 20-25% average reduction in FHB symptoms. This gene and its associated markers have been validated in numerous breeding programs and is widely used to more precisely breed for resistance. About a dozen other genes affecting FHB reaction have been identified, but they have smaller and more inconsistent effects compared with Fhbl. Nevertheless, breeders are discovering which of these markers can be combined with Fhbl in their genetic backgrounds to enhance resistance. The establishment of the USDA-ARS Regional Small Grains Genotyping Centers and similar facilities around the world have increased the capacity for wheat breeders to utilize this powerful technology. More efficient DNA extraction technologies and marker platforms will allow breeders to more fully implement MAS in the future. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rapid progress in archaeobotany and ethnobotany are also contributing new knowledge to understanding crop domestication. This sense of rapid progress is encapsulated in this Special Issue, which contains 18 papers by scientists in botanical, crop sciences and related disciplines on the topic of crop domestication. One paper focuses on current themes in the genetics of crop domestication across crops, whereas other papers have a crop or geographic focus. One feature of progress in the sciences related to crop domestication is the availability of well-characterized germplasm resources in the global network of genetic resources centres (genebanks). Germplasm in genebanks is providing research materials for understanding domestication as well as for plant breeding. In this review, we highlight current genetic themes related to crop domestication. Impressive progress in this field in recent years is transforming plant breeding into crop engineering to meet the human need for increased crop yield with the minimum environmental impact - we consider this to be 'super-domestication'. While the time scale of domestication of 10 000 years or less is a very short evolutionary time span, the details emerging of what has happened and what is happening provide a window to see where domestication might - and can - advance in the future.

AB Significant progress has been made in the characterization of loci controlling traits of importance using molecular markers. A number of markers are currently available in wheat for genes of interest to the breeders. Markers can be used to better characterize parental material, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of parental selection for crossing and to track genes in segregating progenies through the selection process. Although a number of breeding programs are using molecular markers at modest levels, the costs associated with marker assisted selection (MAS) are frequently cited as the main constraint to their wide-spread use by plant breeders. However, this is likely to change when user-friendly, high-throughput, automated marker technologies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms become available. These evolving technologies will increase the number of available markers, and will improve the efficiency, throughput, and cost effectiveness of MAS, thereby making it more attractive and affordable to many breeding programs. This article examines the extent to which molecular markers have been used at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in applied wheat breeding and reviews the limited publicly available information on MAS from other wheat breeding programs. As markers are currently available for relatively few traits, we believe that MAS must be integrated with ongoing conventional breeding to maximize its impact. When used in tandem with phenotypic selection, MAS will improve response to selection for certain traits, thereby increasing rates of genetic progress.

AB To understand the genetic gains of grain yield in the Southern China Winter Wheat Region (SCWWR), two yield potential trials, i.e., YPT 1 including 11 leading cultivars from the Middle and Low Yangtze Valley (Zone III) and YPT 2 including 15 leading cultivars from the Southwestern China Region (Zone IV) from 1949 to 2000, were conduced during the 2001-2003 cropping seasons. A completely randomized block design of three replicates was employed with controlled field environments. Molecular markers were used to detect the presence of dwarfing genes and the 1B/1R translocation. Results showed that average annual genetic gain was 0.31% (P < 0.05) or 13.96 kg/ha/year and 0.74% (P < 0.01) or 40.80 kg/ha/year in Zones III and IV, respectively. In YPT 1, changes of all other traits were not significant, but plant height was significantly reduced. In YPT 2, the genetic improvement of grain yield was primarily attributed to the increased thousand kernel weight (TKW) (0.65%, P < 0.01) and kernel weight/spike (0.87%, P < 0.01), reduced plant height and increased harvest index (HI). The dwarfing gene Rht 8 was most frequently present (46.1%), Rht-B1b was observed in three genotypes in Zone III, and Rht-D1b was present in only one genotype in Zone IV. The 1B/1R translocation was present in four genotypes. Utilization of Italian germplasm and development of landmark cultivar Fan 7 were the key factors for grain yield improvement in SCWWR. The future challenge of wheat breeding in this region is to continue improving grain yield and disease resistance, and to develop cultivars suitable for the reduced tillage of wheat/rice double cropping. Utilization of Mexican germplasm could provide opportunities for future yield improvement.

AB The Pm3 gene from wheat confers resistance against powdery mildew and recent studies have shown that it is a member of a multigene family in the wheat genome. We compared genomic sequences ranging front 178 to 332 kb containing six Pm3-like genes and five gene fragments from orthologous loci in the A genome of wheat at three different ploidy levels. We found that the wheat Pm3 loci display an extremely dynamic evolution where sequence conservation is minimal between species and basically limited to very short sequences containing the: genetic markers that define the orthology. The Pm-3-like genes and their up- and downstream regions were reshuffled by multiple rearrangements, resulting in a complex mosaic of conserved and unique sequences. Comparison with rice showed that the known wheat Pm3-like genes represent only one branch of a large superfamily with several clusters in rice and suggests the presence of additional similar genes in the wheat genome. Estimates of divergence times and transposable-element insertions indicate that the Pm3 locus in wheat has undergone more drastic changes in its recent evolution than its counterpart in rice. This indicates that loci containing homologous resistance gene analogs can evolve at highly variable speeds in different species.

AB Wheat-barley disomic and ditelosomic chromosome addition lines have been used as genetic tools for a range of applications since their development in the 1980s. In the present study, we used the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip for comparative transcript analysis of the barley cultivar Betzes, the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring, and Chinese Spring Betzes ditelosomic chromosome addition lines to physically map barley genes to their respective chromosome arm locations. We mapped 1257 barley genes to chromosome arms 1HS, 2HS, 2HL, 3HS, 3HL, 4HS, 4HL, 5HS, 5HL, 7HS, and 7HL based on their transcript levels in the ditelosomic addition lines. The number of genes assigned to individual chromosome arms ranged from 24 to 197. We validated the physical locations of the genes through comparison with our previous chromosome-based physical mapping, comparative in silico mapping with rice and wheat, and single feature polymorphism (SFP) analysis. We found our physical mapping of barley genes to chromosome arms to be consistent with our previous physical mapping to whole chromosomes. In silico comparative mapping of barley genes assigned to chromosome arms revealed that the average genomic synteny to wheat and rice chromosome arms was 63.2% and 65.5%, respectively. In the 1257 mapped genes, we identified SFPs in 924 genes between the appropriate ditelosomic line and Chinese Spring that supported physical map placements. We also identified a single small rearrangement event between rice chromosome 9 and barley chromosome 4H that accounts for the loss of synteny for several genes.

AB Greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), represents the most important pest insect of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, in the Great Plains of the United States. Biotype E is the most widespread and dominant type not only in sorghum and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., fields, but also on many noncultivated grass species. This study was designed to determine sorghum accession PI 550610 resistance to greenbug biotype E, to map the resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by using an established simple sequence repeat (SSR) linkage map and to identify SSR markers closely linked to the major resistance QTLs. In greenhouse screening tests, seedlings of PI 550610 showed strong resistance to the greenbug at a level similar to resistant accession PI 550607. For QTL mapping, one F-2 population containing 277 progeny and one population containing 233 F,,, families derived from Westland A line X PI 550610 were used to genotype 132 polymorphic SSR markers and to phenotype seedling resistance to greenbug feeding. Phenotypic evaluation of sorghum seedling damage at 7, 12, 17, and 21 d postinfestation in the F-2.3 families revealed that resistance variation was 14 normally distributed. Single marker analysis indicated 16 SSRs spread over five chromosomes were significant for greenbug resistance. Composite interval and multiple interval mapping procedures indicated that a major QTL resided in the interval of 6.8 cM between SSR markers Xtxp358 and Xtxp289 on SBI-09. The results will be valuable in the development of new greenbug biotype E resistant sorghum cultivars and for the further characterization of major genes by map-based cloning.

AB Einkorn wheat Triticum monococcum (2n=2x=14, A(m)A(m)) is one of the earliest domesticated crops. However, it was abandoned for cultivation before the Bronze Age and has infrequently been used in wheat breeding. Little is known about the genetic variation in adaptively important biological traits in T. monococcum. A collection of 30 accessions of diverse geographic origins were characterized for phenotypic variation in various agro-morphological traits including grain storage proteins and endosperm texture, nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain profiles of resistance (R) genes and resistance gene analogues (RGAs), and germination under salt and drought stresses. Forty-six SSR (single sequence repeat) markers from bread wheat (T. aestivum, 2n=6x=42, AABBDD) A genome were used to establish trait-marker associations using linear mixed models. Multiple significant associations were identified, some of which were on chromosomal regions containing previously known genetic loci. It is concluded that T. monococcum possesses large genetic diversity in multiple traits. The findings also indicate that the efficiency of association mapping is much higher in T. monococcum than in other plant species. The use of T. monococcum as a reference species for wheat functional genomics is discussed.

AB FHB resistance QTL alleles from Nyuubai, Sumai-3, and Wuhan-1 were evaluated for their effect on Fusarium head blight (FHB) index, Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK), deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation, plant height, anthesis date, and numerous grain quality traits in three elite Canadian spring wheat backgrounds. The three FHB resistance parameters were negatively correlated with plant height in the three populations. The Wuhan-1 4B resistance allele was the most effective resistance allele but was associated with a 9.3 cm increase in plant height. The Wuhan-1 2D, Nyuubai 3BSc, Sumai-3 3BSc, Nyuubai 5AS, and Sumai-3 5AS alleles were also effective FHB resistance alleles in these populations. The Nyuubai and Sumai-3 3BS alleles were the least effective of the FHB resistance alleles in the FHB nursery tests. The Sumai-3 5AS resistance allele was significantly associated with reduced grain protein content, while the same trend was observed for the Nyuubai 5AS resistance allele but was not significant. FHB resistance tended to increase with more FHB resistance alleles introgressed into the elite genetic background, which suggested that marker-assisted selection (MAS) will prove useful for improving FHB resistance in Canadian germplasm.

AB Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) have great effect on wheat processing quality, but were numerous and difficult to dissect by SDS-PAGE. The development of functional markers may be the most effective way for a clear discrimination of different LMW-GS genes. In the present study, three different approaches were used to identify SNPs of different genes at Glu-D3 and Glu-B3 loci in bread wheat for the development of six STS markers (3 for Glu-D3 and 3 for Glu-B3 genes) that were validated with distinguished wheat cultivars. Firstly, seven LMW-GS gene sequences (AY585350, AY585354, AY585355, AY585356, AY585349, AY585351 and AY585353) from Aegilops tauschii, the diploid donor of the D-genome of bread wheat, were chosen to design seven pairs of AS-PCR primers for Glu-D3 genes. By amplifying the corresponding genes from five bread wheat cultivars with different Glu-D3 alleles (a, b, c, d and e) and Ae. tauschii, a primer set, S13F2/S13R1, specific to the gene AY585356, was found to be positive to cultivars with alleles Glu-D3c and d. Nevertheless, the other five pairs of primers designed from AY585350, AY585349, AY585353, AY585354 and AY585355, respectively, did not produce specific PCR products to the cultivars tested. Secondly, all the PCR products from the five primer sets without specific characteristics were sequenced and an SNP from the gene AY585350 was detected in the cultivar Hartog, which resulted in the second STS marker S1F1/S1R3 specific to the allelic variant of AY585350. Thirdly, three Glu-D3 sequences (AB062851, AB062865 and AB062872) and three Glu-B3 sequences (AB062852, AB062853 and AB062860) defined by Ikeda et al. (2002) were chosen to query wheat EST and NR databases, and DNA markers were developed based on the putative SNPs among the sequences. Using this approach, four STS markers were developed and validated with 16-19 bread wheat cultivars. The primer set T1F4/T1R1 was also a Glu-D3 gene-specific marker for AB062872, while T2F2/T2R2, T5F3/T5R1 and T13F4/T13R3 were all Glu-B3 gene specific markers for AB062852, BF293671 and AY831800, respectively. The chromosomal locations of the six markers were verified by amplifying the genomic DNA of Ae. tauschii (DD), T. monococcum (AA) and T. turgidum (AABB) entries, as well as Chinese Spring and its group 1 chromosome nulli-tetrasomic lines. The results are useful to discriminate the corresponding Glu-D3 and Glu-B3 genes in wheat breeding programs.

AB Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is a ubiquitous enzyme involved in purine metabolism which catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Although the essential role of XDH is well documented in the nitrogen-fixing nodules of leguminous plants, the physiological importance of this enzyme remains uncertain in non-leguminous species such as Arabidopsis. To evaluate the impact of an XDH deficiency on whole-plant physiology and development in Arabidopsis, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to generate transgenic lines of this species in which AtXDH1 and AtXDH2, the two paralogous genes for XDH in this plant, were silenced simultaneously. The nearly complete reduction in the total XDH protein levels caused by this gene silencing resulted in the dramatic overaccumulation of xanthine and a retarded growth phenotype in which fruit development and seed fertility were also affected. A less severe silencing of XDH did not cause these growth abnormalities. The impaired growth phenotype was mimicked by treating wild-type plants with the XDH inhibitor allopurinol, and was reversed in the RNAi transgenic lines by exogenous supplementation of uric acid. Inactivation of XDH is also associated with precocious senescence in mature leaves displaying accelerated chlorophyll breakdown and by the early induction of senescence-related genes and enzyme markers. In contrast, the XDH protein levels increase with the aging of the wild-type leaves, supporting the physiological relevance of the function of this enzyme in leaf senescence. Our current results thus indicate that XDH functions in various aspects of plant growth and development.

ID GENOME EVOLUTION
AB Retrotransposon-like elements are major constituents of most eukaryotic genomes. For example, they account for roughly 90% of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome. Previous study on a wheat strain treated by low-energy N(+) ions indicated the variations in AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) markers. One such variation was caused by the re-activation of Ty1-copia-like retrotransposons, implying that the mutagenic effects of low-energy ions might work through elevated activation of retrotransposons. In this paper an expression pro. le of Ty1-copia-like retrotransposons in wheat treated by low-energy N(+) ions is reported. The reverse transcriptase (RT) domains of these retrotransposons were amplified by reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequentially cloned. 42 and 65 clones were obtained from the treated (CL) and control materials (CK), respectively. Sequence analysis of each clone was performed by software. Phylogeny and classification were calculated responding to the sequences of the RT domains. All the results show that there is much difference in the RT domain between the control sample and the treated sample. Especially, the RT domains from the treated group encode significantly more functional ORF (open reading frames) than those from the control sample. This observation suggests that the treated sample has higher activation of retrotransposons, possibly as a consequence of low-energy ion beam irradiation. It also suggests that retrotransposons in the two groups impact the host gene expression in two different ways and carry out different functions in wheat cells.

AB Two types of markers-random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeat DNA (SSR)-have been used to characterize the genetic diversity among nine mutant lines of transgenic wheat intermediated by low energy ion beam and their four receptor cultivars. The objectives of this study were to analyze RAPD-based and SSR-based genetic variance among transgenic wheat lines and with their receptors, and to find specific genetic markers of special traits of transgenic wheat lines. 170 RAPD primers were amplified to 733 fragments in all the experimental materials. There were 121 polymorphic fragments out of the 733 fragments with a ratio of polymorphic fragments of 16.5%. 29 SSR primer pairs were amplified to 83 fragments in all the experiment materials. There were 57 polymorphic fragments out of the 83 fragments with a ratio of polymorphic fragments of 68.7%. The dendrograms were prepared based on a genetic distance matrix using the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair-group Method with Arithmetic averaging) algorithm, which corresponded well to the results of the wheat pedigree analysis and separated the 13 genotypes into four groups. Association analysis between RAPD and SSR markers with the special traits of transgenic wheat mutant lines discovered that three RAPD markers, s1, opt16, and f14, were significantly associated with the muticate trait, while three SSR markers, Rht8 (Xgwm261), Rht-B1b, and Rht-D1b, highly associated with the dwarf trait. These markers will be useful for marker-assistant breeding and can be used as candidate markers for further gene mapping and cloning.

AB To better understand the development of wheat roots, a reference map of the major soluble proteins of wheat roots was established using a combination of 2-DE and MALDI TOF MS and MS/ MS, and a total of 450 protein spots were detected with silver staining in a pH ranges of 4-7, of which 282 spots corresponding to 240 proteins were identified. These identified proteins were grouped into diverse functional categories. in comparison with a wheat leave proteome, in root, proteins involved in metabolism and transport were over-represented, whereas proteins involved in energy, disease and defense, transcription, and signal transduction were under-represented. To further get an insight into the molecular basis of wheat heterosis, differential proteome analysis between hybrid and parents were performed. A total of 45 differentially expressed protein spots were detected, and both quantitative and qualitative differences could be observed. Moreover, 25 of the 45 differentially expressed protein spots were identified, which were involved in metabolism, signal transduction, energy, cell growth and division, disease and defense, secondary metabolism. These results indicated that hybridization between two parental lines can cause expression differences between wheat hybrid and its parents not only at mRNA levels but also at protein abundances.

AB This study was conducted to identify microsatellite markers (SSR) linked to the adult-plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr22a and examine their cross-applicability for marker-assisted selection in different genetic backgrounds. Lr22a was previously introgressed from Aegilops tauschii Coss. to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and located to chromosome 2DS. Comparing SSR alleles from the donor of Lr22a to two backcross lines and their recurrent parents showed that between two and five SSR markers were co-introgressed with Lr22a and the size range of the Ae. tauschii introgression was 9-20 cM. An F-2 population from the cross of 98B34-T4B x 98B26-N1C01 confirmed linkage between the introgressed markers and Lr22a on chromosome 2DS. The closest marker, GWM296, was 2.9 cM from Lr22a. One hundred and eighteen cultivars and breeding lines of different geographical origins were tested with GWM296. In total 14 alleles were amplified, however, only those lines predicted or known to carry Lr22a had the unique Ae. tauschii allele at GWM296 with fragments of 121 and 131 bp. Thus, GWM296 is useful for selecting Lr22a in diverse genetic backgrounds. Genotypes carrying Lr22a showed strong resistance to leaf rust in the field from 2002 to 2006. Lr22a is an ideal candidate to be included in a stack of leaf rust resistance genes because of its strong adult-plant resistance, low frequency of commercial deployment, and the availability of a unique marker.

AB The present study was conducted to assess the susceptibility of seven local wheat cultivars from Palestine to infection with black stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Two techniques of disease inoculation were applied during bioassays: global inoculation of entire wheat plants with urediospores and localized inoculation with urediospores on wheat leaf-pieces incubated under humid conditions. Susceptibility of tested cultivars was evaluated according to disease scale based on number and size of typical uredial pustules that appeared after inoculation on entire plants or leaf-pieces. Results obtained on bioassay of susceptibility and disease rating on entire plants indicated that Anbar, Kamatat and Hetiya safra cultivars were the least susceptible to P. g. tritici infection, whereas Debiya beda cultivar was the most susceptible. The other tested cultivars such as Nab-El-Jamal, Debiya sawda and Senf 870 were moderately susceptible. On leaf-pieces, Anbar and Kamatat were the least susceptible cultivars, whereas Debiya beda and Nab-El-Jamal were the most susceptible cultivars. The other tested cultivars such as Debiya sawda, Serif 870 and Hetiya safra were moderately susceptible. Significant reductions were obtained for the size of uredial pustules formed on leaf-pieces when inoculated in an unwounded state compared to the wounded, indicating the importance of wounds during inoculation. The global results indicated the possibility of using the above method of disease inoculating, scaling and rating for evaluation of wheat cultivars susceptibility for the eventual use in breeding program for resistant varieties in Palestine.

AB Genes transferred to crop plants from wild species are often associated with deleterious traits. Using molecular markers, we detected a cryptic introgression with a leaf rust resistance gene transferred from Aegilops triuncialis L. into common wheat (Triticurn aestivum L.). One agronomically desirable rust-resistant introgression line was selected and advanced to BC3F11 from a cross of hexaploid wheat and A. triuncialis. In situ hybridization using A. triuncialis genomic DNA as a probe failed to detect the alien introgression. The translocation line was resistant to the most prevalent races of leaf rust in India and Kansas. Genetic mapping in a segregating F-2:3 population showed that the rust resistance was monogenically inherited. Homeologous group 2 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers XksuF11, XksuH16, and Xbg123 showed diagnostically polymorphic alleles between the resistant and susceptible bulks. The alien transfer originated from homeologous chromosome recombination. The A. triuncialis-specific alleles of XksuH16, XksuF11, Xbg123, and one simple sequence repeat marker Xcfd50 cosegregated with the rust resistance, suggesting that the wheat-A. triuncialis translocation occurred in the distal region of chromosome arm 2BL. This translocation was designated T2BS.2BL-2(t)L(0.95). The unique source and map location of the introgression on chromosome 213 indicated that the leaf rust resistance gene is new and was designated Lr58.

AB Host resistance to stem rust of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn., is more effective and durable when several stem rust resistance (Sr) genes are pyramided into a single line. We studied the Sr9a allele, one of six known alleles at the Sr9 locus on chromosome 2BL, using 116 F-2 plants and their F-2:3 families derived from the cross of near-isogenic lines (NILs) 'Chinese Spring' and ISr9a-Ra. Four microsatellite markers were identified that mapped within 3.6 cM proximal to the Sr9a locus. Fifty-nine wheat accessions were screened with the three codominant and one dominant markers to determine their polymorphism information content (PIC). The marker Xgwm47 revealed 12 alleles and had the highest PIC value of 0.85. We attempted to postulate the presence of Sr9a by phenotypic screening. In accessions that had multiple Sr genes, however, it was not possible to postulate Sr9a due to masking effects. Despite the ambiguity of phenotypic evaluation, Xgwm47 was diagnostic for Sr9a in additional NILs tested. These results suggest that Xgwm47 will be a useful tool for marker-assisted selection of Sr9a in wheat breeding programs.

Seed weight of the Mesoamerican landraces was <= 1 g, whereas that of the Italian landraces varied from 1 g to 2.5 g and was related to their origin. Oval shape was more frequent, with round shape observed only in Mesoamerican landraces. Three seed coat colours were observed: white, violet mottled or spotted black and buff spotted brown, also this trait was related to the origin. The level of polymorphism detected by molecular markers was low but with significant discriminant power. ISSRs were the most effective markers prone to unravel molecular polymorphism. The within accession component of variation exceeded that among accessions, as expected for an allogamous species. However correct classification of the individuals was achieved performing either discriminant analysis of the seed phenotypic traits or cluster analysis of seedling similarity measure based on the whole banding patterns obtained by the three marker types. Our data suggest that the Italian farmers, starting with ancestral Mesoamerican runner bean introductions in Europe, bred their own landraces through selection for seed size and seed coat colour, but occasional gene flow maintained variability within landraces bred by different farmers in the same Italian Region. Selection favored molecular and seed trait uniformity within several landraces making them suitable for certification.

AB In the presented study, the existing AFLP and SSR maps of barley were used to find chromosomal position of four genes controlling different stages of root hair development. Four barley mutants were used in the analysis: the root hairless mutant rhl1.b, mutant rhp1.b with root hair development blocked at the initial bulge formation, mutant rhi1.a with irregular pattern of sparsely located root hairs and mutant rhs1.a with very short root hairs. Each mutant was crossed with parents of 'Steptoe'/'Morex' mapping population and F-2 progenies of crosses: mutant x 'Steptoe' and mutant x 'Morex' were analyzed for segregation of root hair phenotype and polymorphic AFLP and SSR markers. It was possible to map all the analyzed genes on barley chromosomes: rhl1 gene on the short arm of chromosome 7H, rhp1 gene on chromosome 1H, rhs1 locus in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 5H and rhi1 gene on the long arm of chromosome 6H. Subsequently, the Bulk Segregant Analysis and AFLP technique were used for saturation of the identified regions with new markers. The joint maps were constructed using as common points the SSR markers located in the target regions. Linkage maps of the regions around the four genes involved in the root hair formation in barley were composed of 8-11 markers and spanned over 16.1-49.0 cM. The distances between localized genes and the closest markers ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 cM. The identified chromosomal locations of genes can be used for their fine mapping and future map-based cloning.

AB The height-reducing gene Rht8 was introduced into Italian wheats by breeder Nazareno Strampelli from the Japanese landrace Akakomugi, and has been widely used in wheats adapted to southern and eastern European conditions. Following identification of a close linkage to Rht8, microsatellite marker Gwm261 has been used extensively to screen large numbers of diverse international germplasm. A 192bp allele at this locus has been taken as "diagnostic" for Rht8 and used to infer the international distribution of Rht8. In this paper, we report several instances of cultivars and mapping populations that vary for the presence of the 192bp allele at the Xgwm261 locus (Xgwm261 (192) ), but with no associated reduction in height, suggesting a lack of association with Rht8. For instance, in the population derived from a cross between Sunco (Rht-B1b, Xgwm261 (165) ) and Tasman (Rht-D1b, Xgwm261 (192) ), there were significant height differences associated with the segregation of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, but no height differences between Xgwm261 genotypes. Similar results were obtained in a population derived from the cross between Molineux (Rht-B1b, Xgwm261 (192) ) and Trident (Rht-D1b Xgwm261 (208) ). In contrast, the cross between Trident and Chuanmai 18 (Xgwm261 (192) ) gave significant height effects at both the Rht-D1 and Xgwm261 loci, with no epistatic interaction between loci. Chuanmai 18 is closely related to the Strampelli wheat Mara (ancestrally derived from Akakomugi) and is therefore likely to carry Rht8. The old Japanese cultivar Norin 10, used by Norman Borlaug to introduce Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b into Mexican wheats, also has a 192bp allele at the Xgwm261 locus, and the sequence of the amplified product is identical to that of Akakomugi. We suggest that the widespread use of Norin 10-derived germplasm during and after the Green Revolution introduced a second haplotype into international germplasm, in which Xgwm261 (192) has no association with Rht8. Therefore, the presence of Xgwm261 (192) is only indicative of Rht8 in wheat cultivars that have inherited this allele from Akakomugi or a Strampelli wheat ancestor.

AB Screening of rice germplasm against Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason), biotypes in India has led to identification of over 300 resistant rice genotypes. However, only ten resistance genes have been characterized so far. Identification of new genes through classical allelism test is tedious and time consuming. We propose to use closely linked flanking Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers in allelism tests for identification of resistance genes. Of the ten known gall midge resistance genes, eight have been tagged and mapped. The Gm1 and Gm2 genes have closely linked flanking markers. Hence SSR markers RM219 and RM444, flanking the gene Gm1, and RM317, RM241 along with the SCAR marker F8, flanking the gene Gm2, were selected for this study. Tests with one set of 13 genotypes likely to carry Gm1 and another set of 17 genotypes suspected to contain Gm2 suggested the presence of the respective allele in all the 13 and 15 genotypes from these sets, respectively. Classical allelism test perfectly matched with the markers test. There were two exceptions involving amplification with RM444 in cultivar Kavya and with RM241 in genotype AE20, suggesting a single recombination which could have resulted in the mismatch. All the three markers in the genotype Bhumansan and the two flanking markers RM317 and F8 in AE20 indicated the absence of the Gm2 allele. This was validated through a classical test, revealing a segregation ratio of 15 resistant: 1 susceptible F-2 progeny of both the crosses between the Gm2 source Phalguna and these genotypes. We performed the allelism test with the markers on another set of 56 randomly selected gall midge resistant genotypes to discover possible sources of new resistance genes.

AB Wild types of narrow-leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) have seed pods that shatter upon maturity, leading to the loss of their seeds before or during the harvest process. Two recessive genes have been incorporated into domesticated cultivars of this species to maximize harvest-ability of the produce. One of these genes is called lentus (le). Two microsatellite - anchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) candidate markers were identified as closely linked to the le gene in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a domesticated x wild type cross. The candidate MFLP markers were isolated from the gel, re-amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. The MFLP polymorphisms were converted into sequence-specific PCR-based markers. Linkage analysis by MapManager indicated that one of the markers, LeM1, was 2.6 centiMorgans (cM) and the other, LeM2, was 1.3 cM from the gene, with both being on the same side. The correlation between the marker genotype and the plant phenotype for the le gene is 95% for the Australian cultivars, and approximately 36% on wild types tested. These markers may be useful in marker assisted selection for the le gene when introgressing wild material into lupin breeding programs.

AB Wheat and triticale plants were transformed by bombardment of isolated scutella with a genetic construct consisting of the two anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory genes, C1 and Bperu, each under the control of the Ltp1 embryo-specific promoter. Transgenic plants were obtained in the absence of selective pressure and selectable marker gene at a transformation frequency of 0.93% and 1.55% in triticale and wheat, respectively. Initial screening of T-0 lines was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and further confirmation of PCR positives was done using real-time PCR and by phenotypic observation. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was developed to determine the transgene copy number in transgenic wheat and triticale. A conserved wheat housekeeping gene, puroindoline-b, was used as an internal control to calculate the transgene copy number in wheat and the SYBR green detection method with a standard curve, constructed on the basis of serially diluted plasmid, was used to calculate the transgene copy in triticale. Estimated transgene copies varied from 3 to 8 in wheat and 4 to 7 in triticale lines. The presence of anthocyanin regulatory genes, promoter, and termination sequences was detected in six wheat lines and four triticale lines. However, anthocyanin-pigmented embryos were only observed visually in mature T-1 seeds of two transgenic wheat lines and a single triticale line. Multisite insertion and reorganization of transgenes was likely the explanation for the failure of expression for the anthocyanin genes in the remaining wheat and triticale transgenic lines.

AB Aluminium toxicity is a major problem for crop production on acid soils. Rye (Secale cereale L.) has one of the most efficient group of genes for aluminium tolerance, at least, four independent and dominant loci, Alt1, Alt2, Alt3 and Alt4, located on chromosome arms 6RS, 3RS, 4RL and 7RS, have been described. The increasing availability of expressed sequence tags in rye and related cereals provides a valuable resource of non-anonymous DNA molecular markers. In order to obtain simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers related with Al tolerance more than 1,199 public accessible rye cDNA sequences from Al-stressed roots were exploited as a resource for SSR markers development. From a total of 21 S. cereale microsatellite (SCM) loci analysed, 12 were located on chromosomes 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R and 5R, using wheat-rye addition lines or mapped using a F-2 population segregating for Al tolerance. Seven SCM loci were included in a rye map with other SCIM and RAPD markers. Moreover, 14 SCM loci could be associated to proteins with known or unknown function. The possible implications of these sequences in aluminium tolerance mechanisms are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: The acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicide sulfosulfuron is registered in Australia for the selective control of Hordeum leporinum Link. in wheat crops. This herbicide failed to control H. leporinum on two farms in Western Australia on its first use. This study aimed to determine the level of resistance of three H. leporinum biotypes, identify the biochemical and molecular basis and develop molecular markers for diagnostic analysis of the resistance.
   RESULTS: Dose-response studies revealed very high level (>340-fold) resistance to the sulfonylurea herbicides sulfosulfuron and sulfometuron. In vitro ALS assays revealed that resistance was due to reduced sensitivity of the ALS enzyme to herbicide inhibition. This altered ALS sensitivity in the resistant biotypes was found to be due to a mutation in the ALS gene resulting in amino acid proline to serine substitution at position 197. In addition, two- to threefold higher ALS activities were consistently found in the resistant biotypes, compared with the known susceptible biotype. Two cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed for diagnostic testing of the resistant populations.
   CONCLUSION: This study established the first documented case of evolved ALS inhibitor resistance in H. leporinum and revealed that the molecular basis of resistance is due to a Pro to Ser mutation in the ALS gene. (C) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB The Lr34/Yr18 resistance gene provides durable, adult-plant, slow rusting resistance to leaf rust, yellow rust, and several other diseases of wheat. Flag leaves may exhibit spontaneous leaf tip necrosis and tips are more resistant than leaf bases. Despite the importance of this gene, the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Patterns of expression for 55,052 transcripts were examined by microarray analysis in mock-inoculated flag leaves of two pairs of wheat near isogenic lines for Li-34/Yr18 (Jupateco 73S/Jupateco 73R and Thatcher/Thatcher-Lr34). The Thatcher isolines were also examined for patterns of expression after inoculation with leaf rust. Mock-inoculated leaf tips of resistant plants showed up-regulation of 57 transcripts generally associated with ABA inducibility, osmotic stress, cold stress, and/or seed maturation. Several transcripts may be useful as expression markers for Lr34/Yr18. Five transcripts were also up-regulated in resistant leaf bases. The possible role of these transcripts in resistance is discussed. In mock-inoculated plants, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were not up-regulated in resistant flag leaves compared with that in susceptible flag leaves. In inoculated plants, the same set of PR proteins was up-regulated in both resistant and susceptible flag leaves. However, expression was often higher in resistant plants, suggesting a possible role for Lr34/Yr18 in printing of defense responses.

AB Two pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes consisting of a barley chitinase (chi-2) and a wheat lipid-transfer-protein (ltp) were introduced singly and in combination into carrot plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (bar) gene as a selectable marker. Over 75% of regenerated plants were confirmed to be positive for the transgenes by PCR and RT-PCR and were resistant to the herbicide Liberty (0.2%, v/v). Northern analysis and immunoblotting confirmed the expression of the transgenes in about 70% of the plants, with variable expression levels among individual lines. Southern analysis revealed from one to three copies of each transgene. Transgenic plants were inoculated with two necrotrophic foliar fungal pathogens, Alternaria radicicola and Botrytis cinerea, and showed significantly higher resistance when both PR genes were expressed compared to single-gene transformants. The level of disease reduction in plants expressing both genes was 95% for Botrytis and 90% for Alternaria infection compared to 40-50% for single-gene transformants. The chi2 and ltp genes could be deployed in combination in other crop plants to significantly enhance resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens.

AB In hexaploid wheat, leaf rust resistance gene Lr1 is located at the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 5D. To clone this gene, an F-1-derived doubled haploid population and a recombinant inbred line population from a cross between the susceptible cultivar AC Karma and the resistant line 87E03-S2B1 were phenotyped for resistance to Puccinia triticina race 1-1 BBB that carries the avirulence gene Avr1. A high-resolution genetic map of the Lr1 locus was constructed using microsatellite, resistance gene analog (RGA), BAC end (BE), and low pass (LP) markers. A physical map of the locus was constructed by screening a hexaploid wheat BAC library from cultivar Glenlea that is known to have Lr1. The locus comprised three RGAs from a gene family related to RFLP marker Xpsr567. Markers specific to each paralog were developed. Lr1 segregated with RGA567-5 while recombinants were observed for the other two RGAs. Transformation of the susceptible cultivar Fielder with RGA567-5 demonstrated that it corresponds to the Lr1 resistance gene. In addition, the candidate gene was also confirmed by virus-induced gene silencing. Twenty T (1) lines from resistant transgenic line T (0)-938 segregated for resistance, partial resistance and susceptibility to Avr1 corresponding to a 1:2:1 ratio for a single hemizygous insertion. Transgene presence and expression correlated with the phenotype. The resistance phenotype expressed by Lr1 seemed therefore to be dependant on the zygosity status. T (3)-938 sister lines with and without the transgene were further tested with 16 virulent and avirulent rust isolates. Rust reactions were all as expected for Lr1 thereby providing additional evidence toward the Lr1 identity of RGA567-5. Sequence analysis of Lr1 indicated that it is not related to the previously isolated Lr10 and Lr21 genes and unlike these genes, it is part of a large gene family.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat has become a serious threat to wheat crops in numerous countries. In addition to loss of yield and quality, this disease is of primary importance because of the contamination of grain with mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). The Swiss winter cultivar Arina possesses significant resistance to FHB. The objective of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to FHB, DON accumulation and associated traits in grain in a double haploid (DH) population from a cross between Arina and the FHB susceptible UK variety Riband. FHB resistance was assessed in five trials across different years and locations. Ten QTL for resistance to FHB or associated traits were detected across the trials, with QTL derived from both parents. Very few of the QTL detected in this study were coincident with those reported by authors of two other studies of FHB resistance in Arina. It is concluded that the FHB resistance of Arina, like that of the other European winter wheat varieties studied to date, is conferred by several genes of moderate effect making it difficult to exploit in marker-assisted selection breeding programmes. The most significant and stable QTL for FHB resistance was on chromosome 4D and co-localised with the Rht-D1 locus for height. This association appears to be due to linkage of deleterious genes to the Rht-D1b (Rht2) semi-dwarfing allele rather than differences in height per se. This association may compromise efforts to enhance FHB resistance in breeding programmes using germplasm containing this allele.

AB Phenotypic, genetic and molecular studies were made of Brassica napus lines with mitochondrial genomes consisting of DNA from both B. napus and Arabidopsis thaliana. The lines were isogenic regarding the nuclear and plastid genomes. Out of 21 lines, 10 were male-sterile, 3 semi-sterile and 8 male-fertile. Screening of the mitochondrial genomes with a dense set of A. thaliana specific markers showed that most lines contained large but variable portions of A. thaliana mitochondrial DNA. Several of the A. thaliana sequences in the mitochondrial genomes lead to the accumulation of novel transcripts. In addition, the restorer line showed different ability to restore male-fertility in the male-sterile lines. These results indicate that CMS is caused by several mitochondrial loci or combinations of loci. Beside petal and stamen morphology, growth rate and adenylate content varied among the lines. Furthermore, we found that the mitochondrial background had a distinct influence on nuclear gene expression. A clear example is the reduced expression of the two B-genes APETALA3 and PISTILATA in the male-sterile lines. From the studies made comparing the mitochondrial loci and the observed phenotypic alterations, our interpretation is that different loci in the mitochondrial genome influence nuclear gene expression via several retrograde signalling pathways.

AB Association mapping in populations relevant for wheat breeding has a large potential for validating and fine-mapping QTLs identified in F2- or DH (double haploid)-derived populations. In this study, associations between markers in the region of QSng.sfr-3BS, a major QTL for resistance to Stagonospora nodorum glume blotch (SNG), and SNG resistance were investigated by linkage and association analyses. After increasing marker density in 240 F-5:7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), QSng.sfr-3BS explained 43% of the genetic variance and peaked 0.6 cM proximal from the marker SUN2-3B. Association between SNG resistance and markers mapped in the region of QSng.sfr-3BS was investigated in a population of 44 modern European winter wheat varieties. Two genetically distinct subpopulations were identified within these lines. In agreement with linkage analyses, association mapping by a least squares general linear model (GLM) at marker loci in the region of QSng.sfr-3BS revealed the highest association with SNG resistance for SUN2-3B (p < 0.05). Association mapping can provide an effective mean of relating genotypes to complex quantitative phenotypes in hexaploid wheat. Linkage disequilibrium (r(2)) in chromosome 3B extended less than 0.5 cM in 44 varieties, while it extended about 30 cM in 240 RILs, based on 91 SSR and STS marker-pair comparisons. This indicated that the association mapping population had a marker resolution potential at least 390-fold higher compared to the RIL population.

AB Characterization of microsatellites is extremely important for the development of molecular markers. Here, we present the detection and abundance of microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in UniGene sequences of Citrus sinensis. A total of 427 SSRs were mined in 8786 UniGene sequences downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Depending on the repeat units, the length of SSRs ranged from 14 to 21 for mono- 14 to 48 for di-, 18 to 48 for tri-, 24 to 40 for tetra- and 42 bp for hexa-nucleotide repeats. Average density of SSRs (ISSR/12.92 kb of 5518.71 kb sequences mined) suggests that only 4.43% of sequences contained SSRs. Di-nucleotide repeats were most frequent repeat type (49.41%) followed by tri-nucleotide repeats (41.45%). An attempt was made to design primer pairs for 427 identified SSRs but these were found only for 216 sequences. The positions of SSRs with respect to open reading frame (ORF) detected and annotation of sequences containing SSRs were also carried out to assign function to each of the sequences.

AB The new science of genomics has an important contribution to make to the development of agriculture in the 'Third World' and thus to improving the livelihoods of many of the poorest people on earth. The persistence of poverty demonstrates, however, that this contribution is not yet being made. We therefore examine the web of connections between the two and enquire whether they could be strengthened in some way, perhaps by the addition of some vital 'missing link', so that the contribution from genomics can be maximised. Since the use of molecular markers to help develop improved crop varieties (marker-assisted selection) constitutes one of the main ways in which genomic knowledge could be used to improve rural livelihoods, we review this technology and discuss the ways in which it could contribute to plant breeding. We argue that marker-assisted selection (MAS) is likely to be most effective when it is both (i) linked to the farmers who are expected to cultivate the new crop varieties that will eventually be developed; and (ii) integrated with plant breeding and with a range of complementary disciplines. Such integration necessarily involves the formation of effective trans-disciplinary teams, an undertaking that is often problematic, and so the final part of this article considers the processes that this involves and suggests ways in which they may be managed effectively.

AB Rye (Secale cereale) is an important diploid (2n = 14, RR) crop species of the Triticeae and a better understanding of its organellar genome variation can aid in its improvement. Previous genetic analyses of rye focused on the nuclear genome. In the present study, the objective was to investigate the organellar genome diversity and relationships of 96 accessions representing diverse geographic regions using chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA PCR-RFLPs. Seven cpDNA and 4 mtDNA coding and noncoding regions were amplified using universal cpDNA and mtDNA primer pairs. Each amplified fragment was digested with 13 different restriction enzymes. mtDNA analysis indicated that the number of polymorphic loci (20) was low and genetic differentiation (G(ST)) was 0.60. excluding the outgroups (hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD; triticale, xTriticosecale Wittmack, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBRR). cpDNA analysis revealed a low level of polymorphism (40%) among the accessions, and GST was 0.39. Of the 96 genotypes studied, 70 could not be differentiated using cpDNA PCR-RFLPs even though they are from different geographic regions. This is most likely due to germplasm exchange. indicating that genotypes might have a common genetic background. Two cpDNA and 3 mtDNA fragments were significantly correlated to the site of germplasm collection. However, there was no clear trend. These results indicate that the level of organellar polymorphism is low among the cultivated rye genotypes. The cpDNA and mtDNA PCR-RFLP markers used in the present study could be used as molecular markers in rye genetics and breeding programs.

AB Rust disease, incited by the fungus Uromyces vignae, adversely affects production and quality of asparagus bean and other types of cowpea in many parts of the world. Genetic resistance to the rust pathogen has been identified in a few accessions, but it is difficult to efficiently transfer the resistance to a broad range of asparagus bean cultivars using traditional breeding approaches. We determined that rust resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene designated Rr1 in the cross of a highly resistant cultivar ZN016 and highly susceptible cultivar Zhijiang 282. Bulked segregant analysis was applied to an F-2 Population derived from these parents, and an AFLP marker (E-AAG/M-CTG), 150 bp in size, was detected in the resistant bulk. The AFLP fragment vias then converted to a SCAR marker, named ABRS(AAG/CTG98);98, and the genetic distance between the marker and the Rrl gene was estimated to be 5.4 cM. This SCAR marker could be used effectively for MAS of Rr1 in breeding programs to develop rust-resistant asparagus bean cultivars and potentially more widely to breed rust-resistant cultivars of other types of cowpea.

AB Molecular markers were used to analyze the genomic structure of an euploid series of Eragrostis curvula, obtained after a tetraploid dihaploidization procedure followed by chromosome re-doubling with colchicine. Considerable Levels of genome polymorphisms were detected between tines. Curiously, a significant number of molecular markers showed a revertant behavior following the successive changes of ploidy, suggesting that genome alterations were specific and conferred genetic structures characteristic of a given ploidy Level. Genuine reversion was confirmed by sequencing. Cluster analysis demonstrated grouping of tetraploids white the diploid was more distantly related with respect to the rest of the plants. Polymorphic revertant sequences involved mostly non-coding regions, although some of them displayed sequence homology to known genes. A revertant sequence corresponding to a P-type adenosine triphosphatase was found to be differentially represented in cDNA Libraries obtained from the diploid and a colchiploid, but was not found expressed in the original tetraploid. Transcriptome profiling of inflorescence followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction validation showed 0.34% polymorphic bands between apomictic tetraploid and sexual diploid plants. Several of the polymorphic sequences corresponded to known genes. Possible correlation

AB The cereal cyst nematode (CCN) Heterodera avenae, is a significant pathogen of wheat. The wild grass Aegilops variabilis Accession No.1 has been found to be resistant to pathotypes of CCN; at least two genes transferred to wheat, designated as CreX and CreY, are involved in the resistance response. The CreY gene may be the same as Rkn-mn1, which confers resistance to root knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne naasi. The objective of this work was to pyramid the two CCN resistance genes in a wheat background through marker-assisted selection. As a first step, molecular markers flanking CreX were identified. The completely linked RAPD marker of Rkn-mn1 (CreY), OpY16-(1065,) previously obtained, was converted into a SCAR. All these dominant markers were used to incorporate in the same genotype the two Ae. variabilis chromosome segments carrying the two genes for resistance. CCN bioassays with the Ha12 pathotype showed that the level of resistance of the pyramided line was significantly higher than that of CreX and CreY single introgression lines, but lower than that of Ae. variabilis. This study thus illustrates the utilization of molecular markers in breeding for host resistance.

AB The genetic structure of Septoria passerinii from nine field populations was examined at several scales (within lesions, among lesions in a leaf, among leaves in a field, and among fields in North Dakota and western Minnesota) by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 390 isolates were sampled front seven barley fields located in North Dakota and two barley fields located nearby in western Minnesota in 2003 and 2004. Based on 57 polymorphic AFLP markers, AFLP DNA fingerprints identified 176 different genotypes among 390 (non-clone-corrected) isolates in nine different fields. In two intensively sampled sites, ND16 (Williston, ND) and ND17 (Langdon, ND), only one to four different genotypes were found within a lesion. A higher level of Genetic and genotypic diversity was found within a leaf in which six to nine different genotypes were found from lesions on a leaf. The genetic diversity within a leaf was similar to the genetic diversity within a field. The average genetic diversity (H) within a field across all AFLP loci was approximately 0.3, except at site ND12 (Carrington, ND) where it was 0.16. Genotypic diversity was high in all populations, and with the exception of ND15 (Rothsay, MN), very low multilocus linkage disequilibrium values ( (r) over bar (d)) were found in all populations. The population differentiation, G(ST), was relatively high (G(ST) = 0.238) among the nine populations due to the high G(ST) in ND 12, ND 14 (Twin Valley, MN), and ND15. Population differentiation without those three populations was 0.09. A lack of correlation between geographical distance and genetic distance was found, suggesting the potential for a high level of gene flow between different geographical regions. The population genetic structure described in this study for S. passerinii in North Dakota and western Minnesota is consistent with that of a sexually reproducing fungus.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint for wheat production in acidic soils. An Al resistance gene on chromosome 4DL that traces to Brazilian wheat has been extensively studied, and can provide partial protection from Al damage. To identify potentially new sources of Al resistance, 590 wheat accessions, including elite wheat breeding lines from the United States and other American and European countries, landraces and commercial cultivars from East Asia, and synthetic wheat lines from CIMMYT, Mexico, were screened for Al resistance by measuring relative root elongation in culture with a nutrient solution containing Al, and by staining Al-stressed root tips with hematoxylin. Eighty-eight wheat accessions demonstrated at least moderate resistance to Al toxicity. Those selected lines were subjected to analysis of microsatellite markers linked to an Al resistance gene on 4DL and a gene marker for the Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1) locus. Many of the selected Al-resistant accessions from East Asia did not have the Al-resistant marker alleles of ALMT1, although they showed Al resistance similar to the US Al-resistant cultivar, Atlas 66. Most of the cultivars derived from Jagger and Atlas 66 have the Al-resistant marker alleles of ALMT1. Cluster analysis separated the selected Al-resistant germplasm into two major clusters, labeled as Asian and American-European clusters. Potentially new germplasm of Al resistance different from those derived from Brazil were identified. Further investigation of Al resistance in those new germplasms may reveal alternative Al-resistance mechanisms in wheat.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between genetic and phenotypic distances of parents and the genetic potential of crosses as measured by the frequency of transgressive segregants in homozygous populations. Material for the study involved 17 barley cross-combinations. In each cross, the parental genotypes, F-2 hybrids and doubled haploid (DH) lines were analysed. Yield and yield-related traits were observed in the experiments. Phenotypic (univariate and multivariate) and genetic distances (GD) were investigated between pairs of parental genotypes. Genetic distance was evaluated by using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. In F2 generations, the genetic coefficient of variability (GCV) was evaluated. Within all the cross-combinations studied, each DH line was compared with both parents to distinguish the positive and negative transgressive lines. In addition, the coefficient of gene distribution (r) along parental genomes was evaluated. Relationships between frequency of transgression and both phenotypic and GDs, GCV and r, were assessed by regression analysis. It was found that for all the traits studied the frequency of transgressive lines depended mainly on gene distribution (r). Genetic distance between parents appeared to be significant for the occurrence of transgression effects in plant height, ear length, grain weight per ear and grain yield per plot. Regression analysis has shown that phenotypic differences between parental genotypes were also important for the frequency of transgressive lines. A weak relationship was found between the variation of F2 hybrids and the occurrence of transgressive lines. The results indicate that occurrence of transgressive segregants in a homozygous population should be considered as a phenomenon dependent simultaneously on several factors characterizing parental genotypes. Among them, the most important are: gene distribution, phenotypic diversity and GD.

AB A spontaneously developed wheat-barley 4H(4D) disomic substitution line was identified cytogenetically using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), multicolour fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and microsatellite markers. The ability of the barley 4H chromosome to compensate for wheat 4D in response to mild drought stress was also investigated. In the barley cv. 'Betzes' and the 4H(4D) substitution line, mild osmotic stress induced intensive stomatal closure, resulting in reduced water loss through transpiration and unchanged relative water content in the leaves. As the CO2 assimilation rate remained relatively high, the water use efficiency, which is an important factor associated with drought tolerance, increased extensively under mild osmotic stress in these lines. In the case of the parental wheat genotypes, however, mild drought stress induced less intense stomatal closure and a greater decrease in the CO2 assimilation rate than in barley or in the substitution line, resulting in unaugmented or reduced water use efficiency. The results demonstrate that genes localised on the 4H chromosome of barley were able to increase the water use efficiency of the wheat substitution line, which is suitable for improving wheat drought tolerance through intergeneric crossing.

AB Crown rust caused by Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae Eriks is a serious problem for oat production worldwide and pyramiding multiple resistance genes into new cultivars is a key objective of breeders. Many race specific resistance genes have been mapped and markers that are closely linked to them have been identified. However, the use of these markers in oat breeding practice has been limited due to the economics of marker assisted selection (MAS) deployment. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have been demonstrated to have a high-throughput capability with relatively low cost and numerous semi-automated SNP scoring platforms exist. Gene Pc94 has remained highly effective since it was first tested on the Canadian crown rust populations in 1993 and is one of the few effective genes available in Western Canada. In the present study, PCR products were amplified using primers derived from sequences of amplified fragment length polymorphism bands which have been shown to be linked to Pc94. Genomic DNA from genotypes, with and without the Pc94 gene, were used as the PCR templates. By comparative sequence alignment amongst the PCR fragments, many putative SNP sites were identified. From these sites, four SNP sites were selected and validated by the single base extension method. One SNP site, Pc94-SNP1a, was tested on two F-2:3 populations segregating for the resistance gene. The map distances between the SNP marker and Pc94 were 2.1 and 5.4 cM in the two different populations. Various oat cultivars and germplasm lines were also tested for a wider application of the SNP marker. Fluorescent technology and capillary electrophoresis allowed for the semi-automated, fairly high-throughput scoring of the SNP markers.

AB A set of simple sequence repeat (SSR or microsatellite) markers was used to discriminate a collection of 33 Spinacia oleracea hybrid cultivars from seven different breeding stations all over the world. All SSR markers were genic microsatellite markers located in coding or non-coding regions of genes of known function. Cluster analysis based on 13 of the SSR markers showed that the spinach hybrids grouped into three clusters. The first two clusters consisted of European spinach types, which were well discriminated according to their origin from different breeding stations. The third cluster was a mixture of Asian as well as European types of spinach. Subclusters in this group did not reflect differences in morphology, earliness or company origin.. The data show that genic microsatellites are a powerful tool for discrimination of spinach cultivars.

AB Diploid A genome species of wheat harbour immense variability for biotic stresses and productivity traits, and these could be transferred efficiently to hexaploid wheat through marker assisted selection, provided the target genes are tagged at diploid level first. Here we report an integrated molecular linkage map of A genome diploid wheat based on 93 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Triticum boeoticum x Triticum monococcum inter sub-specific cross. The parental lines were analysed with 306 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 194 RFLP markers, including 66 bin mapped ESTs. Out of 306 SSRs tested for polymorphism, 74 (24.2 %) did not show amplification (null) in both the parents. Overall, 171 (73.7 %) of the 232 remaining SSR and 98 (50.5 %) of the 194 RFLP markers were polymorphic. Both A and D genome specific SSR markers showed similar transferability to A genome of diploid wheat species. The 176 polymorphic markers, that were assayed on a set of 93 RILs, yielded 188 polymorphic loci and 177 of these as well as two additional morphological traits mapped on seven linkage groups with a total map length of 1,262 cM, which is longer than most of the available A genome linkage maps in diploid and hexaploid wheat. About 58 loci showed distorted segregation with majority of these mapping on chromosome 2A(m). With a few exceptions, the position and order of the markers was similar to the ones in other maps of the wheat A genome. Chromosome 1A(m) of T. monococcum and T. boeoticum showed a small paracentric inversion relative to the A genome of hexaploid wheat. The described linkage map could be useful for gene tagging, marker assisted gene introgression from diploid into hexaploid wheat as well as for map based cloning of genes from diploid A genome species and orthologous genes from hexaploid wheat.

AB Bread-making quality has been evaluated in a progeny of 194 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross between the two French cultivars Recital and Renan, cultivated in three environments. These cultivars have been previously identified as having contrasting grain protein content and dough rheology properties, although they achieve similar scores for the official bread-making test used for cultivar registration in France. However the progeny displayed a wide range of variations, suggesting that favourable alleles at several loci are present in the two parental lines. Correlation analyses revealed that bread-making scores are poorly correlated among environments, as they are poorly predicted by multiple regression on dough rheology parameters and flour-protein content. However, loaf volume was the most heritable and predictable trait. A total of seven QTLs were found for bread scores, each explaining 5.9-14.6% of trait variation and six for the loaf volume (10.7-17.2%). Most bread-making QTLs, and particularly those detected in all environments, co-located with QTLs for dough rheology, protein content or flour viscosity due to soluble pentosans (Fincher and Stone 1986; Anderson et al. in J Cereal Sci 19:77-82, 1994). Some QTL regions such as those on chromosome 3A and chromosome 7A, which display stable QTLs for bread-making scores and loaf volume, were not previously known to host obvious genes for grain quality.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telomorph: Gibberella zeae Schw. (Petch)], is an increasingly important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Host-plant resistance provides the best hope for reducing economic losses associated with FHB, but new sources of resistance are limited. The moderately resistant winter wheat cultivar, Ernie, may provide a source of resistance that differs from Sumai 3 but these genes have not been mapped. Also hindering resistance breeding may be associations of resistance with agronomic traits such as late maturity that may be undesirable in some production environments. This research was conducted to identify QTL associated with type II FHB resistance (FHB severity, FHBS), and to determine if they are associated with days to anthesis (DTA), number of spikelets (NOS), and the presence/absence of awns. Two hundred and forty-three F-8 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between the resistant cultivar, Ernie and susceptible parent, MO 94-317 were phenotyped for type II FHB resistance using point inoculation in the greenhouse during 2002 and 2003. Genetic linkage maps were constructed using 94 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 146 amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers. Over years four QTL regions on chromosomes 2B, 3B, 4BL and 5A were consistently associated with FHB resistance. These QTL explained 43.3% of the phenotypic variation in FHBS. Major QTL conditioning DTA and NOS were identified on chromosome 2D. Neither the QTL associated with DTA and NOS nor the presence/absence of awns were associated with FHB resistance in Ernie. Our results suggest that the FHB resistance in Ernie appears to differ from that in Sumai 3, thus pyramiding the QTL in Ernie with those from Sumai 3 could result in enhanced levels of FHB resistance in wheat.

AB Toxicity due to high levels of soil boron (B) represents a significant limitation to cereal production in some regions, and the Bol gene provides a major source of B toxicity tolerance in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A novel approach was used to develop primers to amplify and sequence gene fragments specifically from the Bol region of the hexaploid wheat genome. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were then used to generate markers close to Bol on the distal end of chromosome 7BL. In the 16 gene fragments totaling 19.6 kb, SNPs were observed between the two cultivars Cranbrook and Halberd at a low frequency (one every 613 bp). Furthermore, SNPs were distributed unevenly, being limited to only two genes. In contrast, RFLP provided a much greater number of genetic markers, with every tested gene identifying polymorphism. Bol previously known only as a QTL was located as a discrete Mendelian locus. In total, 28 new RFLP, PCR and SSR markers were added to the existing map. The 1.8 cM Bol interval of wheat corresponds to a 227 kb section of rice chromosome 6L encoding 21 predicted proteins with no homology to any known B transporters. The co-dominant PCR marker AWW5L7 cosegregated with Bol and was highly predictive of B tolerance status within a set of 94 Australian bread wheat cultivars and breeding lines. The markers and rice colinearity described here represent tools that will assist B tolerance breeding and the positional cloning of Bol.

AB Finger millet is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 36) grass that belongs to the Chloridoideae subfamily. A comparative analysis has been carried out to determine the relationship of the finger millet genome with that of rice. Six of the nine finger millet hornoeologous groups corresponded to a single rice chromosome each. Each of the remaining three finger millet groups were orthologous to two rice chromosomes, and in all the three cases one rice chromosome was inserted into the centromeric region of a second rice chromosome to give the finger millet chromosomal configuration. All observed rearrangements were, among the grasses, unique to finger millet and, possibly, the Chloridoideae subfamily. Gene orders between rice and finger millet were highly conserved, with rearrangements being limited largely to single marker transpositions and small putative inversions encompassing at most three markers. Only some 10% of markers mapped to non-syntenic positions in rice and finger millet and the majority of these were located in the distal 14% of chromosome arms, supporting a possible correlation between recombination and sequence evolution as has previously been observed in wheat. A comparison of the organization of finger millet, Panicoideae and Pooideae genomes relative to rice allowed us to infer putative ancestral chromosome configurations in the grasses.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) that results in reduced grain yield and quality through the accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). Coincident QTL for FHB severity, DON concentration, and heading date (HD) map to a region of chromosome 2(2H) designated Qrgz-2H-8. It is unclear whether disease resistance at this locus is due to a pleiotropic effect of late HD by delaying the host exposure to the pathogen or a tightly linked resistance gene. The objectives of this study were to develop a set of near isogenic lines (NILs) for the Qrgz-2H-8 region and to genetically dissect the QTL region containing the coincident traits. Two NIL populations were developed consisting of F-2- and F-4-derived recombinants from a cross between a BC5 line carrying the donor parent (Chevron) alleles in the Qrgz-2H-8 region and the recurrent parent M69. Analysis of field and marker data from these NILs revealed that the Chevron alleles conditioning FHB resistance, late HD, and low DON concentration were successfully introgressed into the BC5 parent line and were segregating among NILs. QTL analysis of the F-4-derived population showed that the HD QTL is adjacent to the FHB QTL. Furthermore, a single NIL was identified that was similar to the resistant BC5 parent for FHB severity and the early flowering parent M69 for HD. These results indicate that the relationship between FHB and HD at the Qrgz-2H-8 region is likely due to tight linkage rather than pleiotropy.

AB Grain hardness is a major factor influencing the classification and end-use quality of bread wheat. In this study, 40 Yunnan endemic wheats, 21 historical cultivars and 66 current cultivars and advanced lines were investigated for kernel hardness and puroindoline alleles using molecular and biochemical markers. The frequencies of soft, mixed and hard genotypes were 10.0%, 5.0% and 85.0%, respectively, in Yunnan endemic wheats, whereas the corresponding frequencies were 47.6%, 23.8% and 28.6% in historical cultivars, and 36.3%, 6.1% and 57.6% in current cultivars and advanced lines. Four known puroindoline alleles, Pina-D1b, Pinb-D1b, Pinb-D1d and Pinb-D1e, were found in the hard wheat cultivars. Compared with endemic wheats and historical cultivars, current cultivars from Yunnan province have relatively high frequencies of Pina-D1b and Pinb-D1b alleles at 43.5% and 16.1%, respectively. All 32 hard Yunnan endemic wheats (Triticum aestivum ssp. yunnanense King) contained a new puroindoline b allele, designated Pinb-D1u, that was characterized as a single nucleotide (G) deletion at position 127 in the coding sequence of the Pinb gene, leading to a shift of the open reading frame (ORF) from position 14 in the deduced amino acid sequence and a stop codon corresponding to position Leu-18. The average SKCS hardness of genotypes with Pina-D1b (68.2) is significantly higher than those of Pinb-D1b (60.3) and Pinb-D1u (60.5). The study of puroindoline alleles in Yunnan germplasm could provide useful information for improving processing quality and further understanding the molecular basis of kernel hardness in bread wheat.

AB Wheat powdery mildew and stripe rust, caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp.tritici (syn. Erysiphe graminis f.sp.tritici) and Puccinia striiformis Westend., respectively, are two important fungal diseases of wheat in many regions in the world that cause significant annual yield losses. In the present study, a dominant powdery mildew and a dominant stripe rust resistance gene in wheat line 101-3 which derived from the progenies of the wide cross between common wheat and Dasypyrum villosum Candary L., was located on chromosome 6B and 1B, respectively, by monosomic analyses. The two genes are different from known resistance genes on chromosome 6B for powdery mildew and 1B for stripe rusts, suggesting that the two genes might be novel resistance genes for powdery mildew and stripe rust, respectively. It is uncertain whether the two genes are allelic or lined with other resistance genes located on chromosome 6B for powdery mildew and 1B for stripe rust. Further allelism tests are necessary to determine the relationships between the resistance gene and other genes located on chromosome 6B for powdery mildew and 1B for stripe rust through molecular markers.

AB The main objective of the present study was to identify mitochondrial DNA based marker, which can distinguish male sterile and fertile counterparts of the cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines used in production of rice hybrids. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis in CMS lines: IR58025A & IR62829A and their respective maintainers: IR58025B & IR62829B identified a polymorphic DNA fragment of about 510 bp size that was present in both CMS (A) and absent in their maintainer (B) lines. Sequencing followed by database analysis of the polymorphic fragment indicated about 97% similarity with mitochondrial NADH gene subunits of rice, maize and wheat. Based on the variable sequence regions, a site specific primer pair (BF-STS-401) was designed. PCR analysis showed that BF-STS-401 could amplify a strong band of 464 bp size in CMS and a faint band of the same size in maintainer line. To act as a positive control and avoid possible errors in PCR, BF-STS-401 was multiplexed with a new primer pair (BF-STS-402), derived from mitochondrial atp9 subunit of rice, producing monomorphic amplification indiscriminately in both CMS and maintainer lines. Both the primer pairs in combination clearly differentiated CMS lines from their corresponding maintainer lines. This primer combination was validated in a set of diverse genotypes consisting of different sources of CMS lines, restorer lines, hybrids, varieties and mixed samples from private seed companies. Our results suggested that the multiplex primer pairs developed in this study can be effectively utilized to assess the genetic purity in commercial seed lots of CMS lines and hybrids of rice.

AB In this study, we assessed a broad range of barley breeding lines and commercial varieties by three hardness methods (two particle size methods and one crush resistance method (SKCS-Single- Kernel Characterization System), grown at multiple sites to see if there was variation in barley hardness and if that variation was genetic or environmentally controlled. We also developed near-infrared reflectance (NIR) calibrations for these three hardness methods to ascertain if NIR technology was suitable for rapid screening of breeding lines or specific populations. In addition, we used this data to identify genetic regions that may be associated with hardness. There were significant (p < 0.05) genetic effects for the three hardness methods. There were also environmental effects, possibly linked to the effect of protein on hardness, i.e. increasing protein resulted in harder grain. Heritability values were calculated at > 85% for all methods. The NIR calibrations, with R-2 values of > 90%, had Standard Error of Prediction values of 0.90, 72 and 4.0, respectively, for the three hardness methods. These equations were used to predict hardness values of a mapping population which resulted in genetic markers being identified on all chromosomes but chromosomes 2H, 3H, 5H, 6H and 7H had markers with significant LOD scores. The two regions on 5H were on the distal end of both the long and short arms. The region that showed significant LOD score was on the long arm. However, the region on the short arm associated with the hardness (hordoindoline) genes did not have significant LOD scores. The results indicate that barley hardness is influenced by both genotype and environment and that the trait is heritable, which would allow breeders to develop very hard or soft varieties if required. In addition, NIR was shown to be a reliable tool for screening for hardness. While the data set used in this study has a relatively low variation in hardness, the tools developed could be applied to breeding populations that have large variation in barley grain hardness.

AB Wheat is one of the world's most important cereal. Microprojectile bombardment is currently the most widely used technique for gene transformation of recalcitrant species. Immature embryos of bread wheat cv. Atilla 50Y was used for optimization of gene transfer through biolistic bombardment because this cultivar has shown a good response to tissue culture of immature embryos in a previous study. Effect of pressure of bombardment (a1 = 900 and a2 = 1100 psi), distance of bombardment from rapture disk to plate (b1 = 6, b2 = 7.5 and b3 = 9 cm) and number of bombardments (c1 = one and c2 = two) were studied in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with two replications. The results showed that small embryos (0.5-1.5 mm) had better response to bombardment than large embryos (1.5-3 mm). Minimum doses of kanamycin, hygromycin and bar as a selectable marker in our experiment on immature embryos of bread wheat cv. Atilla 50Y were identified as 75, 50 and 7.5 mg/l media. Number of blue spots per embryo at 1100 psi (13.13) was significantly different from that at 900 psi (11.42). Bombardment distance of 6 cm froth rapture disk to plate and bombarding twice gave best results, although regeneration of plants declined by bombarding twice. Combination of 1100 psi with 6 cm bombardment distance (a2b1) acted best, six transgenic plants for bar and gus genes were obtained. Combination of a2b1c1 was better than the other bombardment combinations with respect to economic point of view and regeneration. Regeneration efficiency decreased by increasing number of bombardments.

AB Nap Hal, an Indian landrace of wheat, exhibited unique characteristics suitable for biscuit making quality. Double null trait at Glu-D1 locus in Nap Hal was associated with reduced gluten strength as reflected in low sedimentation volume (16.0 ml, 6 g test), lower Farinograph peak time (2.0 min) and lower tolerance (higher break down 140 BU) to mixing. PCR analysis of puroindoline genes showed the presence of both pinA and glycine type pinB associated with soft grain texture of wheat. This is the first report that Nap Hal contains unique combination of soft grain characteristics determined by puroindolines as well as low gluten strength determined by null alleles at Glu-D1 locus. The combination of both soft grain characteristics and weak gluten is useful in developing varieties suitable for biscuit making where the use of chemical improvers can be reduced.

AB Lr1 is a dominant leaf rust resistance gene located on chromosome 5DL of bread wheat and the wild species Aegilops tauschii. In this study, three polymorphic markers (WR001, WR002, and WR003) were developed from resistance gene analogs (RGAs) clustering around the Lr1 locus. Using these and other markers, Lr1 was mapped to a genetic interval of 0.79 cM in Ae. tauschii and 0.075 cM in wheat. The CAPS marker WR003, derived from LR1RGA1, co-segregated with Lr1 in both mapping populations of wheat and Ae. tauschii. For isolation of Lr1, two genomic BAC libraries (from Ae. tauschii and hexaploid wheat) were screened using the tightly flanking marker PSR567F and a set of nested primers derived from the conserved region of the RGA sequences. Approximately 400 kb BAC contig spanning the Lr1 locus was constructed. The LR1RGA1 encoding a CC-NBS-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) type of protein was the only one of the four RGAs at the Lr1 locus, which co-segregated with leaf rust resistance. Therefore, it represents a very good candidate for Lr1. The allelic sequences of LR1RGA1 from resistant and susceptible lines revealed a divergent DNA sequence block of similar to 605 bp encoding the LRR repeats 9-15, whereas the rest of the sequences were mostly identical. Within this sequence block, the 48 non-synonymous changes resulted in 44 amino acid differences. This indicates that LR1RGA1 likely evolved through one or more recombination or gene conversion events with unknown genes.

AB Aluminium (Al) tolerance in barley is conditioned by the Alp locus on the long arm of chromosome 4H, which is associated with Al-activated release of citrate from roots. We developed a high-resolution map of the Alp locus using 132 doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross between Dayton (Al-tolerant) and Zhepi 2 (Al-sensitive) and 2,070 F(2) individuals from a cross between Dayton and Gairdner (Al-sensitive). The Al-activated efflux of citrate from the root apices of Al-tolerant Dayton was 10-fold greater than from the Al-sensitive parents Zhepi 2 and Gairdner. A suite of markers (ABG715, Bmag353, GBM1071, GWM165, HvMATE and HvGABP) exhibited complete linkage with the Alp locus in the DH population accounting 72% of the variation for Al tolerance evaluated as relative root elongation. These markers were used to map this genomic region in the Dayton/Gairdner population in more detail. Flanking markers HvGABP and ABG715 delineated the Alp locus to a 0.2 cM interval. Since the HvMATE marker was not polymorphic in the Dayton/Gairdner population we instead investigated the expression of the HvMATE gene. Relative expression of the HvMATE gene was 30-fold greater in Dayton than Gardiner. Furthermore, HvMATE expression in the F(2:3) families tested, including all the informative recombinant lines identified between HvGABP and ABG715 was significantly correlated with Al tolerance and Al-activated citrate efflux. These results identify HvMATE, a gene encoding a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion protein, as a candidate controlling Al tolerance in barley.

AB Isozyme electrophoresis data of seed extracts from I I populations of diploid wheat species (Triticum boeoticum Bioss. and Triticum urartu Thumanian ex Gandilyan), distributed mainly in the western and west-northern Iran, were investigated. The five enzyme systems used were peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, malate dehydrogenase and catalase. The first three were found to be useful as molecular marker for characterization of diploid wheat populations. A total of 13 bands from three enzyme systems were recorded. The value of a 'Jaccard's' similarity coefficient ranges from 0.333 to 1.000. Data analysis was done using clustering method UPGMA. On the basis of Jaccard's coefficient, the obtained dendrogram supports previous relationship between T. boeoticum and T. urartu as separate species as well as reflecting their distinct gene pools and substantiating their specific recognition despite the overall morphological similarity.

AB Two major genes controlling leaf pubescence were mapped on chromosomes 4BL (Hl1) and 7BS (Hl2Aesp) in wheat (Saratovskaya 29) and a wheat/Aegilops introgression line (102/00(I)), respectively, together with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) determining hairiness of the leaf margin (QHl.ipk-4B, QHl.ipk-4D) and auricle (QPa.ipk-4B, QPa.ipk-4D) on the long arms of chromosomes 4B and 4D, respectively. The QTLs on chromosome 4D were contributed by a synthetic wheat and, therefore, originated from Aegilops tauschii. The homoeologous group 4 wheat/A. tauschii genes/QTLs detected in the present study were aligned with the barley pubescence genes Hln/Hsh and Hs(b) and the hairy peduncle rye gene Hp1. The locus seems to be pleiotropically responsible for the pubescence of different plant organs in different species of the Triticeae. Another homoeologous series may be present on the short arms of the homoeologous group 7 chromosomes, based on the results of an allelic test cross between the Chinese local cultivar Hong-mang-mai carrying Hl2 and the wheat/Aegilops speltoides introgression line 102/00(I).

These genes confirmed their effectiveness in both field and greenhouse conditions. Moreover a backcross program was carried out by using as recurrent parents the susceptible high-quality common wheat cvs 'Bolero', 'Colfiorito', 'Serio' and 'Spada' and the 'Thatcher' NILs carrying the above mentioned genes as donor parents. The progenies of different cross combinations were selected by both resistance tests and marker assisted selection using molecular markers (STS, SCAR, CAPS) closely linked to Lr genes: a complete cosegregation was observed between the resistance genes used and the corresponding molecular markers.

AB Clonal reproduction in Puccinia triticina, the cause of wheat leaf rust, has long been hypothesized but has never been demonstrated. Using a population genetics approach and microsatellite markers, we analysed genetic diversity of this fungus at each level of genome organisation. Sampling included isolates from two field populations growing on two cultivars carrying specific resistance genes, completed with isolates representing the main pathotypes identified from a national survey. For the two cultivars, populations differentiated according to the distribution of their genotypes and pathotypes. There was a high proportion of repeated genotypes, combined with a significant linkage disequilibrium and a strong negative value for FIS. These three factors, especially heterozygote excess, strongly support the hypothesis of a high rate of clonal reproduction. Each pathotype matched a unique multilocus genotype, except for a few isolates, which were taken to be mutants of the dominant genotype. We discussed the strong relationship between pathotypes and genotypes as the consequence of clonal reproduction combined with a strong selection exerted by host cultivars. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB To examine changes in the level of and pattern in variability in 197 Nordic and Baltic spring barley cultivars over time we used 21 mapped barley simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A total number of 191 alleles were found from 22 SSR loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 23, with average of 8.63 107 alleles were rare (frequency < 0.05) among the cultivars and only one allele was frequently observed (frequency >0.95). The gene diversity between loci in Nordic and Baltic material varied between 0.033 and 0.891. Average gene diversity was 0.623. The SSR data separated two-rowed and six-rowed cultivars. According to analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) differentiation in two-rowed vs six-rowed accounted for 23.6% of the total variation. Overall no significant decrease of average gene diversity over time could be found. However, differences were observed when spring barleys from northern (north of similar to 58 degrees) and southern (south of similar to 58 degrees) parts of the Nordic and Baltic area were compared. For the southern ecogeographical region significant decrease of' genetic diversity was observed in the middle of the 20th century, whereas no significant changes in the northern part were found. We found larger differentiation between modern and old cultivars in the South compared to the ones in North parts of the region. The magnitude of changes in genetic diversity differed also with the country of origin. Danish cultivars had a significant decrease in diversity in the middle of century, whereas changes in Finland, Norway and Sweden were not significant.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei, is one of the most important diseases of barley in the south-central and western United States. Growing resistant cultivars is the best approach for controlling the disease. The barley genotype BBA 2890 has all-stage resistance against all races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (PSH) identified thus far in the United States. The resistance in BBA 2890 is controlled by a single recessive gene, rps1.a. The objectives of this study were to identify resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers for the all-stage resistance gene rps1.a, to map the gene on a barley chromosome using chromosome-specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and to determine the presence or absence of the flanking RGAP markers for the gene in 24 barley genotypes. Seedlings of the parents and 200 F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were tested for resistance to pathogen races PSH-14, PSH-48. and PSH-54 in the greenhouse in 2005. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents and 150 F8 RILs. The RGAP technique was used to identify molecular markers for the rps1.a gene. Twelve primer pairs generating repeatable polymorphic bands were selected for genotyping the 150 F8 RILs. A genetic linkage group was constructed for the resistance gene with 13 RGAP markers and four chromosome-specific SSR markers. The four SSR markers mapped the gene on the long arm of barley chromosome 3H. The closest RGAP marker for the resistant allele was within a genetic distance of 2.1 centimorgans (cM). The closest marker for the susceptible allele was 6.8 cM away from the locus. The two closest RGAP markers for the resistant allele detected polymorphisms in 67 and 71% of the 24 barley genotypes when used individually, and detected polymorphism in 88% of the genotypes when used in combination. This information should be useful in incorporating the resistance gene into barley cultivars and in pyramiding the gene with other resistance genes for superior stripe rust resistance.

AB A plant pathogenic fungus, Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusatium graminearum), not only generates economic losses by causing disease on cereal grains, but also leads to severe toxicosis in human and animals through the production of mycotoxins in infected plants. Here, we characterized a histidine auxotrophic mutant of G zeae, designated Z43R1092, which was generated using a restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) procedure. The mutant exhibited pleiotropic phenotypic changes, including a reduction in mycelial growth and virulence and loss of sexual reproduction. Outcrossing analysis confirmed that the histidine auxotrophy is linked to the insertional vector in Z43R1092. Molecular analysis showed that the histidine requirement of Z43R1092 is caused by a disruption of an open reading frame, designated GzHIS7. The deduced product of GzHIS7 encodes a putative enzyme with an N-terminal glutamine amidotransferase and a C-terminal cyclase domain, similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS7 required for histidine biosynthesis. The subsequent gene deletion and complementation analyses confirmed the functions of GzHIS7 in G zeae. This is the first report of the molecular characterization of histidine auxotrophy in G zeae, and our results demonstrate that correct histidine biosynthesis is essential for virulence, as well as sexual development, in G zeae. In addition, our results could provide a G zeae histidine auxotroph as a recipient strain for genetic transformation using this new selectable marker.

   EXPRESSION
AB Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity is highly related to the undesirable browning of wheat-based end products, especially Asian noodles. Characterization of PPO genes and the development of their functional markers are of great importance for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. In the present study, complete genomic DNA sequences of two PPO genes, one each located on chromosomes 2A and 2D and their allelic variants were characterized by means of in silico cloning and experimental validation. Sequences were aligned at both DNA and protein levels. Two haplotypes on chromosome 2D showed 95.2% sequence identity at the DNA level, indicating much more sequence diversity than those on chromosome 2A with 99.6% sequence identity. Both of the PPO genes on chromosomes 2A and 2D contain an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,731 bp, encoding a PPO precursor peptide of 577 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of similar to 64 kD. Two complementary dominant STS markers, PPO16 and PPO29, were developed based on the PPO gene haplotypes located on chromosome 2D; they amplify a 713-bp fragment in cultivars with low PPO activity and a 490-bp fragment in those with high PPO activity, respectively. The two markers were mapped on chromosome 2DL using a doubled haploid population derived from the cross Zhongyou 9507/CA9632, and a set of nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and ditelosomic line 2DS of Chinese Spring. QTL analysis indicated that the PPO gene co-segregated with the two STS markers and was closely linked to SSR marker Xwmc41 on chromosome 2DL, explaining from 9.6 to 24.4% of the phenotypic variance for PPO activity across three environments. In order to simultaneously detect PPO loci on chromosomes 2A and 2D, a multiplexed marker combination PPO33/PPO16 was developed and yielded distinguishable DNA patterns in a number of cultivars. The STS marker PPO33 for the PPO gene on chromosome 2A was developed from the same gene sequences as PPO18 that we reported previously, and can amplify a 481-bp and a 290-bp fragment from cultivars with low and high PPO activity, respectively. A total of 217 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines were used to validate the association between the polymorphic fragments and grain PPO activity. The results showed that the marker combination PPO33/PPO16 is efficient and reliable for evaluating PPO activity and can be used in wheat breeding programs aimed for noodle and other end product quality improvement.

AB Wheat crops with greater early vigour shade the soil surface more rapidly and reduce water loss. Evaporative losses affect water-use efficiency particularly in drier regions where most of the rainfall occurs early in the growing season before canopy closure. Greater seedling leaf area and longer coleoptiles are major determinants of increased vigour and better crop establishment. A previously developed high vigour breeding line 'Vigour 18' was used to establish a large recombinant inbred family and framework map to identify a QTL on chromosome 6A that accounted for up to 8% of the variation for coleoptile length, 14% of seedling leaf width and was associated with increased plant height. The SSR marker NW3106, nearest to the 6A QTL, was also associated with greater leaf width in a breeding population that was also derived from a cross involving the high vigour donor line 'Vigour18'. The association between the NW3106 marker and coleoptile length was validated in a second breeding population which was developed using an unrelated long coleoptile donor line. The 'Vigour18' allele of the QTL on chromosome 6A promoted coleoptile length and leaf width during early plant growth but was also associated with increased plant height at maturity. Markers linked to the QTL are being used to increase the frequency of increased vigour and long coleoptile alleles in early generations of breeding populations.

AB Sugar-beet powdery mildew, caused by the fungus Erysiphe betae, now occurs in all sugar-beet growing areas and can reduce sugar yield by up to 30%. Powdery mildew resistant plants from three novel sources were crossed with sugar beet to generate segregating populations. Evaluation of resistance was carried out in artificially inoculated field and controlled environment tests. The resistance level in two of the sources was found to be significantly higher than that in currently available sugar-beet cultivars. AFLP analysis was used in combination with bulked segregant analysis to develop markers linked to the resistant phenotype in each population. Five dominant major resistance genes were identified and assigned the proposed symbols Pm2 to Pm6. Pm3 conferred complete resistance to powdery mildew; the other genes conferred high levels of partial resistance. From the use of anchoring SNP markers, two genes were located to chromosome II and three to chromosome IV. Two of the genes on chromosome IV mapped to the same location and one of the genes on chromosome II mapped to the same region as the previously identified Pm1 gene. With the availability of these genes there is now excellent potential for achieving durable resistance to sugar-beet powdery mildew, thus reducing or obviating the need for chemical control.

AB Background: EST-PCR markers normally represent specific products from target genes, and are therefore effective tools for genetic analysis. However, because wheat is an allohexaploid plant, PCR products derived from homoeologous genes are often simultaneously amplified. Such products may be easier to differentiate if they include intron sequences, which are more polymorphic than exon sequences. However, genomic sequence data for wheat are limited; therefore it is difficult to predict the location of introns. By using the similarities in gene structures between rice and wheat, we developed a system called PLUG (PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene) to design primers so that PCR products include intron sequences. We then investigated whether products amplified using such primers could serve as markers able to distinguish multiple products derived from homoeologous genes.
   Results: The PLUG system consists of the following steps: (1) Single-copy rice genes (Landmark Unique Gene loci; LUGs) exhibiting high degrees of homology to wheat UniGene sequences are extracted; (2) Alignment analysis is carried out using the LUGs and wheat UniGene sequences to predict exon-exon junctions, and LUGs which can be used to design wheat primers flanking introns (TaEST-LUGs) are extracted; and (3) Primers are designed in an interactive manner. From a total of 4,312 TaEST-LUGs, 24 loci were randomly selected and used to design primers. With all of these primer sets, we obtained specific, intron-containing products from the target genes. These markers were assigned to chromosomes using wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. By PCR-RFLP analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis, 19 of the 24 markers were located on at least one chromosome.
   Conclusion: In the development of wheat EST-PCR markers capable of efficiently sorting products derived from homoeologous genes, it is important to design primers able to amplify products that include intron sequences with insertion/ deletion polymorphisms. Using the PLUG system, wheat EST sequences that can be used for marker development are selected based on comparative genomics with rice, and then primer sets flanking intron sequences are prepared in an interactive, semi-automatic manner. Hence, the PLUG system is an effective tool for large-scale marker development.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a disease of small-grain cereals and com caused by a complex of fungal species of the genus Fusarium. The disease reduces the yield and quality of seeds and results in the accumulation of various mycotoxins which cause a variety of toxic effects on humans and livestock. Beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENs) are a group of toxins with antimicrobial, insecticidal and phytotoxic activities produced mainly by F. avenaceum, F. poae and F. tricinctum. In this study, primer sets were designed that were targeted to esyn1 gene homologs encoding multifunctional enzyme enniatin synthetase. Primers used in multiplex PCR amplified products from the FHB species reported to produce (ENs) and/or BEA. The use of the marker developed on asymptomatic wheat seed samples originating from Northern and Southern Poland demonstrated that all samples were positive for the presence of potential enniatin-producing Fusarium species.

AB Cotton breeding for the resistance to root-knot nematode (RKN) [Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood] is hindered by the lack of convenient and reliable screening methods for the resistant plants. The identification of molecular markers closely linked to RKN resistance will facilitate the development of RKN resistant cultivars through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Our objective was to identify and develop new DNA markers that are associated with RKN resistance in cotton. Using three pairs of near-isogenic (NIL) resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines, two AFLP markers, two RAPD markers, and three RGA markers were identified to be polymorphic between the NIL-R and NIL-S lines. One RAPD marker was converted into a sequence-tagged site (STS) marker. In an F-2 population of 'ST 474' x 'Auburn 634 RNR', the two RAPD markers and the STS marker were mapped to the linkage group containing several markers that were previously reported to be linked with the RKN resistance gene rkn1 on chromosome 11 in "Acala NemX'. All these markers were found to be associated with a major RKN resistance gene, presumably Mi(2) in the resistant line Auburn 634 RNR, suggesting that rkn1 and Mi(2) are either allelic or closely linked. In addition, no susceptible recombinants were found in a resistance screen of 200 F-2 plants from the cross Acala NemX x Auburn 634 RNR. The utility of the two RAPD markers are the converted STS marker were evaluated using 23 R and 8 S germplasm lines. The RAPD and STS markers, along with the other previously reported markers associated with RKN resistance will be useful in germplasm screening, MAS and RKN resistance, and map-based cloning for the RKN resistance genes.

AB Hypersensitive, race specific genes primarily have been deployed to control powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis (DC) EO Speer f. sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); however, recent efforts have shifted to breeding for more durable resistance. Previously, three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew in the winter wheat cultivar Massey were identified in a Becker/Massey (BM) F (2:3) population. Fourteen new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were added to the pre-existing BM F (2:3) linkage maps near the QTL for APR on chromosomes 1BL (QPm.vt-1BL), 2AL (QPm.vt-2AL), and 2BL (QPm.vt-2BL). Genetic linkage maps comprised of 17 previously and newly mapped SSRs from the BM population on chromosomes 1BL, 2AL, and 2BL were constructed in a USG 3209/Jaypee (UJ) F (6:7) recombinant inbred line (RIL) confirmation population, wherein the APR resistance of USG 3209 was derived from Massey. Interval mapping analysis of mildew severity data collected in 2002 (F (5:6)) and 2003 (F (6:7)) field experiments with marker genotypic data obtained in 2003 (F (6:7)) confirmed the presence of the three QTL governing APR to powdery mildew in the UJ RILs. The QTL QPm.vt-1BL, QPm.vt-2AL, and QPm.vt-2BL explained 12-13, 59-69, and 22-48% of the phenotypic variance for powdery mildew severity in the UJ confirmation populations, respectively, in two field experiments. The current study verified that the elite wheat cultivar USG 3209 possesses the same QTL for APR as its parent Massey.

AB The leaf and stem surfaces of many land plants are covered with a cuticular wax layer that confers a glaucous appearance or white bloom. Synthetic hexaploid wheat Line 3672 was non-glaucous, and common wheat Line 9753 was glaucous. The cuticular wax was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A hybrid using 9753 as female parent and 3672 as male parent was made and 108 F-2 plants and their F-3 progenies were used to map the non-glaucouness gene. Non-glaucousness in Line 3672 was controlled by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated Iw3672. Five SSR markers mapped on chromosome 2DS were linked to Iw3672. Additionally, two EST-derived markers and a SNP marker were developed and were also linked to Iw3672. The order of the eight markers and Iw3672 was Xte6 (730) /Xbarc124 (520) -Iw3672 -Xwe6 (2100/2150) -Xcau96 (287) -Xcfd51 (180/200/230) -Xwe7-Xgdm5 (190) -Xgdm35 (246/250) , with the genetic distance for each interval being 0.9 cM, 1.4 cM, 0.9 cM, 0.9 cM, 1.9 cM, 7.2 cM and 2.5 cM, respectively. We concluded that Iw3672 is physically mapped on the distal region of wheat chromosome 2DS.

AB Advanced backcross QTL analysis was used to identify QTLs for seedling and adult plant resistance to leaf rust in introgression lines derived from a cross between the spring wheat cultivar 'Saratovskaya 29' and a synthetic allopolyploid wheat (T. timopheevii/T. tauschii). F-2 mapping populations involving two backcross selections ('BC5' and 'BC9' lines) were genotyped with microsatellite markers. Two significant QTL for adult plant resistance were identified in line 'BC5': one on chromosome 2B, but originating from chromosome 2G, explained 31% of the trait variance. The other, derived from T. tauschii and mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2D explained 19% of the trait variance. In the second line, one major seedling and adult plant resistance QTL was identified on chromosome 2B. Both QTL co-located to the same marker interval. Such introgression lines, resulting from the reconstruction of common wheat genome, are of interest both as initial material for breeding and improvement of current cultivars, and as a resource for the study of the interaction and transformation of genomes.

AB Special and degenerate primers are designed according to the conservative sequence of barley powdery mildew resistance genes Mla1, Mla6, and Mla13. Two wheat Mla-like orthologs, TaMla-2 and TaMla-3 are cloned and sequenced from the cDNA of wheat resistant-powdery mildew line TAM104R by RT-PCR method. TaMla-2 and TaMla-3 encode distinct but highly related coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat type (NBS-LRR) resistant disease proteins and both reveal about 74 and 81% identity with amino acid sequence of Mla1, respectively. They are multiple copies in wheat genomes, one copy of them is mapped on wheat chromosome 1AL and two on 1BL using Chinese Spring nulli-tetra-somic lines and ditelosomic lines of 1A, 1B and 1D in southern analysis. This result suggests that may be the two Mla-like genes originated from the two diploid ancestral genomes, respectively. The expression pattern analysis of semi-quantitative PCR shows the TaMla genes are mainly expressed in leaf and sheath, and expression level is enhanced in organs infected by Erysiphe graminis, suggesting that TaMla-2 and TaMla-3 are powdery mildew resistance related-genes in wheat.

AB An agronomic gene pool of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was constructed through recurrent selection. In present research, 24 wheat SSR markers determining 25 loci on 14 different chromosomes were used to evaluate the gene pool. Thirty parents used as original materials in recurrent selection were also assessed. In total, 115 alleles were detected in gene pool with an average of 4.6, ranging from 2 to 9 alleles per locus. Statistical test showed that genetic diversities had no significant difference between the gene pool and the 30 parents. Principle coordinates analysis revealed that the individuals of the gene pool were mainly divided into three groups, which was consistent with the result of cluster analysis based on genetic distance matrix of the gene pool. Cluster analysis was carried out based on Euclidian distance calculated upon five morphological trait values and the results showed that most individuals were in a group while the others scattered. Correlation analysis of genetic distance matrix and Euclidian distance matrix showed no significant correlation between two matrices. The results suggest that the gene pool is improved after several cycles of selection, while genetic variation is still maintained. Therefore, the gene pool is suitable for further breeding program.

AB Five Mycosphaerella graminicola populations from four geographic regions (Australia, Israel, Switzerland, and the USA) were assayed for neutral RFLP markers and mating type idiomorphs. On average, 25-30 genetically distinct isolates were selected from each population and their pathogenicity was measured on two wheat cultivars in a common garden experiment conducted in a greenhouse. A significant difference in pathogenicity was found between MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 isolates. On average, MAT1-1 isolates had 14-22% greater pathogenicity than MAT1-2 isolates. The pattern of higher pathogenicity in MAT1-1 isolates was consistent across four geographical populations and on two wheat cultivars. A uniform and continuous variation in pathogenicity was found among isolates within each mating type, but no genetic differentiation in selectively neutral RFLP loci was found between mating types, consistent with the hypothesis that differences in pathogenicity were not due to the effects of specific pathogenicity genes or non-random genetic backgrounds.

AB Genetic diversity was investigated in 73 accessions of emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank) from 11 geographical regions using a set of 29 simple-sequence repeat (SSR or microsatellite) markers, representing at least two markers for each chromosome. The SSR primers amplified a total of 357 different alleles with an average of 12.31 alleles per locus. The number of fragments detected by each primer ranged between 6 (Xgwm1066) and 21 (Xgwm268). Null alleles were detected in nine of the 29 primers used. A high level of gene diversity index was observed. Across the 29 primers, gene diversity ranged from 0.60 (Xgwm46) to 0.94 (Xgwm655), with a mean of 0.82. There was a highly significant correlation (r=0.882; p<0.01) between gene diversity index and the number of loci, showing the number of loci per se is a strong indicator of diversity. Analysis of genetic diversity within and among eleven geographical regions revealed most of the genetic diversity of the total sample resided within regions. The coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst=0.27) showed that the genetic variation within and among the 11 geographical regions was 73 and 27%, respectively. High value of mean number of alleles per locus was found in Iran (4.86) followed by Morocco (4.10) and Armenia (4.03). On the contrary, lower mean number of alleles per locus was detected in Yemen (2.83). The average gene diversity index across regions ranged from 0.52 (Slovakia) to 0.67 (Morocco) with an average of 0.60. Multivariate techniques of principal component analysis and clustering were employed to examine genetic relationship among the 73 emmer wheat accessions vis-a -vis geographical regions of collections. The genetic distance coefficients for all possible 55 pairs of regional comparisons ranged from 0.63 (between Iran and Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, Georgia and Slovakia) to 0.97 (between Morocco and Yemen, Spain and Georgia, and Turkey and Iran) with a mean of 0.82. From the PCA results, a two dimensional plot of PC1 versus PC2 was constructed. The scatter plot of the first two principal components which explained altogether 27% of the total variation depicted the presence of a clear pattern of geographical differentiation except in few cases like accessions from Caucasian region. Similar pattern of genetic relationships among accessions was observed in cluster analysis. The study provided genetic information of emmer wheat in relation to geographical regions of origin. The information could be utilized in crop improvement, germplasm conservation programs, and in further investigation.

AB The Australian diploid Gossypium species possess traits of potential agronomical value, such as gossypol-free seeds and Fusarium wilt resistance. However, they belong to the tertiary germplasm pool, which is the most difficult group of species from which to introgress genes into G. barbadense L. and G. hirsutum L. lnterspecific triploid hybrids can be generated but they are sterile. The sterility barrier can be overcome using synthetic polyploids as introgression bridges, but whether there is sufficient homoeologous chromosome interaction at meiosis to allow recombination is still an open question. To ascertain, genetically, observable levels of homoeologous introgression, 2 synthetic hexaploid lines (2x G. hirsutum x G. australe and 2x G. hirstrturn x G. sturtianum) were crossed to G. hirsntum to generate pentaploid F-1 plants that. in turn, were backcrossed to G. hirstrtum to generate BC1 and BC2 multiple alien chromosome addition lines (MACALs). Gossypium australe F. Muell. and G. sturtianum Willis chromosome-specific markers were used to track the frequency and fidelity of chromosome transmission to the BC1 and BC2 MACALs. The chromosomal location of the AFLP markers was determined by their distribution among the MACALs and confirmed in parental F-2 families. Roughly half the available chromosomes were transmitted to the G. hirsntum x G. australe (54%) and G. hirsutum x G. sturtianum (52%) BC1 MACALs. The BC2 MACAL families again inherited about half of the available chromosomes. There were, however, notable exceptions for specific chromosomes. Some chromosomes were preferentially eliminated, while others were preferentially transmitted. Consistent with the genornic stability of Gossypium synthetic polyploids, the de novo loss or gain of AFLP fragments was rarely observed. While restructuring of the donor G. australe and G. sturtianum chromosomes seas observed. this is more likely the result of chromatin loss, and no clear cases of introgression of donor chromatin into the recipient G. hirsutum genome were observed.

AB A wheat x maize induced doubled haploid population that segregates at the Awned locus for awned and awnless phenotypes were studied at two field sites using a genetic linkage map. Interval QTL analysis indicated that significant QTLs for wheat flour water absorption and protein content were located on a linkage group associated with the morphological marker, awns. The QTL peak for flour water absorption was located at the Awned locus (B1, 5AL), whilst the QTL peak for protein content was located nearby, 10.1 cm away from the Awned locus. The locations of those QTL were confirmed by analysing data from two independent field trials conducted under different environment conditions. The QTL identified for water absorption controlled 12% and 11% of the observed variance at the two field trials, whilst for flour protein content the QTL explained 7% and 19% of the variance respectively. Variance component analysis indicated that the QTL for water absorption controlled approximately 14.8-25.0% and 13.6-23% of the genetic variance at the two sites studied (Roma and Jimbour) whilst the QTL for protein content explained between 12.8% and 30.4% of the genetic variance at Roma and 34.7-82.6% at Jimbour. Cross-site analysis with composite interval mapping approach resulted in significant LOD values of 6.12 and 9.94 for water absorption and protein content, respectively. The QTL for water absorption was independent from the hardness locus. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Breeding for resistance in the past 15 years has produced limited progress, and newly developed wheat cultivars suffer considerable yield reductions under spot blotch epidemics in the region. Resistance is often controlled by multiple genes with additive effects. Marker-assisted selection, in combination with field selection, could accelerate the identification of progeny with multiple genes for resistance early in the breeding process. A study was conducted to determine microsatellite markers associated with resistance in the F-7 progeny from a cross between the spot blotch-susceptible Sonalika and resistant G162 wheat genotypes. A parental survey using 171 simple sequence repeats (SSR) primer sets and spread over 21 chromosomes of wheat identified 52% polymorphic loci. However, only 15 polymorphic markers showed association with two bulks, one each of progeny with low and with high spot blotch severity. The detailed analysis indicated that progeny lines with low spot blotch severity could be separated from those with high severity using three SSR markers located on three wheat chromosomes. The findings may be useful in developing a marker-assisted selection strategy for spot blotch resistance in wheat.

AB Wheat mutants generated from a cultivar "Geumgangmil" by using a Co-60 source (gamma-ray) were developed for bentazone (3-isopropyl-2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazin-4-one-2,2-dioxide) resistance. Resistant M-2 plants were selected from seedlings and adult plants consecutively. Bent azone-resistant wheat plants were able to survive at up to 10 times (1,600 ppm) the commercially recommended concentration. The four plants with the highest bentazone resistance were selected. An AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) analysis was applied to identify molecular markers for bentazone-resistant wheat mutants. Twelve polymorphic products, which were unique to bentazone-resistant plants, were identified, cloned, and sequenced. Among the twelve polymorphic bands, eight Sequence-tagged Sites (STS) primer sets were designed. Only one STS primer set (HRMW-08) was converted a "Bentazone-resistant wheat-specific" STS marker. The wheat mutants and markers that we obtained could be employed in a cross-breeding program incorporated with marker assisted selection (MAS) in the early stages of population segregation.

AB Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium can cause severe diseases on small grain cereals and maize. The contamination of harvested grain with Fusarium mycotoxins is a threat to human and animal health. In wheat production of the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which inhibits eukaryotic protein biosynthesis, is a virulence factor of Fusarium, and resistance against DON is considered to be part of Fusarium resistance. Previously, single amino acid changes in RPL3 (ribosomal protein L3) conferring DON resistance have been described in yeast. The goal of this work was to characterize the RPL3 gene family from wheat and to investigate the potential role of naturally existing RPL3 alleles in DON resistance by comparing Fusarium-resistant and susceptible cultivars. The gene family consists of three homoeologous alleles of both RPL3A and RPL3B, which are located on chromosomes 4A (RPL3-B2), 4B (RPL3-B1), 4D (RPL3-B3), 5A (RPL3-A3), 5B (RPL3-A2) and 5D (RPL3-A1). Alternative splicing was detected in the TaRPL3-A2 gene. Sequence comparison revealed no amino acid differences between cultivars differing in Fusarium resistance. While using developed SNP markers we nevertheless found that one of the genes, namely, TaRPL3-A3 mapped close to a Fusarium resistance QTL (Qfhs.ifa-5A). The potential role of the RPL3 gene family in DON resistance of wheat is discussed.

AB We report mapping of translocation breakpoints using a microarray. We used complex RNA to compare normal hexaploid wheat ( 17 000Mb genome) to a ditelosomic stock missing the short arm of chromosome 1B ( 1BS) and wheat- rye translocations that replace portions of 1BS with rye 1RS. Transcripts detected by a probe set can come from all three Triticeae genomes in ABD hexaploid wheat, and sequences of homoeologous genes on 1AS, 1BS and 1DS often differ from each other. Absence or replacement of 1BS therefore must sometimes result in patterns within a probe set that deviate from hexaploid wheat. We termed these ` high variance probe sets' ( HVPs) and examined the extent to which HVPs associated with 1BS aneuploidy are related to rice genes on syntenic rice chromosome 5 short arm ( 5S). We observed an enrichment of such probe sets to 15 - 20% of all HVPs, while 1BS represents similar to 2% of the total genome. In total 257 HVPs constitute wheat 1BS markers. Two wheat- rye translocations subdivided 1BS HVPs into three groups, allocating translocation breakpoints to narrow intervals defined by rice 5S coordinates. This approach could be extended to the entire wheat genome or any organism with suitable aneuploid or translocation stocks.

AB Statistical methods established for the genetic analysis of quantitative traits can be applied to gene expression data. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis can associate the expression of genes or groups of genes with particular genomic regions, and thereby identify regions regulating gene expression. A segregating population of 41 doubled haploid (DH) lines from the hard red spring wheat cross RL4452 x 'AC Domain' was used to map expression level polymorphisms. This population had previously been mapped with microsatellites, and includes a full QTL analysis for agronomic and seed quality traits. Expression analysis on mRNA from developing seed grown in two field locations was conducted on 39 of the 41 DH lines using the Affymetrix GeneChip((R)) Wheat Genome Array. Analysis of the hybridization intensity identified 1484 Affymetrix probe sets in the first location and 10 280 probe sets in the second location, where the hybridization intensity varied significantly between genotypes of the population. A common set of 1455 probe sets differing in intensity between genotypes in both locations was used for mapping, and 542 QTLs were identified that each mapped to a single chromosome interval, illustrating that major gene expression QTLs could be found in wheat. Genomic regions corresponding to multiple gene expression QTLs were identified. Comparison of expression mapping data with physical mapping of wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences using rice synteny, as well as logarithm of odds (LOD) score analysis, showed that both cis- and trans-acting expression QTLs were present. Chromosomes 1D and 4B may contain significant trans-regulatory regions in this population.

AB Rapid sequence rearrangements along with alterations in cytosine-directed methylation patterns follow allopolyploid formation in several plant species. The occurrence of similar changes is yet to be examined in detail during the generation of autopolyploids. The objective of this work was to investigate the presence of nascent variation in genome sequence after autopolyploidization in two Paspalum species. The increments of ploidy level were produced either by hybridization involving unreduced gametes or colchicine treatment. Genetic modifications affected 15-23% and 9.55% of the genomic loci in Paspalum rufum and Paspalum notatum, respectively. In all cases the frequency of band loss from the progenitors was significantly higher than that of novel band gain. In random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) experiments the majority of polymorphisms were detected by particular sets of primers, suggesting that repetitive domains were preferentially targeted. Several P. notatum polymorphic fragments were cloned, sequenced and used as probes in genomic hybridization analyses. Some of them corresponded to interspersed middle-repetitive sequences with unknown function. Methylation- sensitive genomic hybridization showed that sequence modifications occurred invariably in cytosine-methylated regions, which remained methylated after polyploidization.

AB Abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity in embryos is one of the key factors in the seed dormancy of wheat. Many ABA signaling genes have been isolated in Arabidopsis, while only a few wheat homologues have been identified. In the present study, diploid wheat homologues to Arabidopsis ABA signaling genes were identified by in silico analysis, and mapped them using a population of diploid wheat recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Triticum monococcum (Tm) and T. boeoticum (Tb). Four diploid wheat homologues, TmVP1, TmABF, TmABI8 and TmERA1 were located on chromosome 3A(m) and TmERA3 was on the centromere region of chromosome 5A(m). In two consecutive year trials, one major QTL on the long arm of 5A(m), two minor QTLs on the long arm of 3A(m) and one minor QTL on the long arm of 4A(m) were detected. The 5A(m) QTL explained 20-27% of the phenotypic variations and the other three QTLs each accounted for approximately 10% of the phenotypic variations. Map positions of the loci of TmABF and TmAB18 matched the LOD peaks of the two QTLs on 3A(m), indicating that these two homologues are possible candidate genes for seed dormancy QTLs. Moreover, we have found two SNPs result in amino acid substitutions in TmABF between Tb and Tm. Comparison of the marker positions of QTLs for seed dormancy of barley revealed that the largest QTL on 5A(m) may be orthologous to the barley seed dormancy QTL, SD1, whereas there seems no orthologous QTL to the corresponding barley SD2 locus.

AB Successful plant establishment is critical to the development of high-yielding crops. Short coleoptiles can reduce seedling emergence particularly when seed is sown deep as occurs when moisture necessary for germination is deep in the subsoil. Detailed molecular maps for a range of wheat doubled-haploid populations (Cranbrook/Halberd, Sunco/Tasman, CD87/Katepwa and Kukri/Janz) were used to identify genomic regions affecting coleoptile characteristics length, cross-sectional area and degree of spiralling across contrasting soil temperatures. Genotypic variation was large and distributions of genotype means were approximately normal with evidence for transgressive segregation. Narrow-sense heritabilities were high for coleoptile length and cross-sectional area indicating a strong genetic basis for differences among progeny. In contrast, heritabilities for coleoptile spiralling were small. Molecular marker analyses identified a number of significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for coleoptile growth. Many of the coleoptile growth QTL mapped directly to the Rht-B1 or Rht-D1 dwarfing gene loci conferring reduced cell size through insensitivity to endogenous gibberellins. Other QTL for coleoptile growth were identified throughout the genome. Epistatic interactions were small or non-existent, and there was little evidence for any QTL x temperature interaction. Gene effects at significant QTL were approximately one-half to one-quarter the size of effects at the Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 regions. However, selection at these QTL could together alter coleoptile length by up to 50 mm. In addition to Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, genomic regions on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 4A, 5D and 6B were repeatable across two or more populations suggesting their potential value for use in breeding and marker-aided selection for greater coleoptile length and improved establishment.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred control of the disease. The spring wheat cultivar 'Alpowa' has both race-specific, all-stage resistance and non-race-specific, high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistances to stripe rust. To identify genes for the stripe rust resistances, Alpowa was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS). Seedlings of the parents, and F-1, F-2 and F-3 progeny were tested with races PST-1 and PST-21 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici under controlled greenhouse conditions. Alpowa has a single partially dominant gene, designated as YrAlp, conferring all-stage resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to YrAlp. A linkage group of five RGAP markers and two SSR markers was constructed for YrAlp using 136 F-3 lines. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with RGAP markers Xwgp47 and Xwgp48 and the two SSR markers indicated that YrAlp is located on the short arm of chromosome 1B. To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the non-race-specific HTAP resistance, the parents and 136 F-3 lines were tested at two sites near Pullman and one site near Mount Vernon, Washington, under naturally infected conditions. A major HTAP QTL was consistently detected across environments and was located on chromosome 7BL. Because of its chromosomal location and the non-race-specific nature of the HTAP resistance, this gene is different from previously described genes for adult-plant resistance, and is therefore designated Yr39. The gene contributed to 64.2% of the total variation of relative area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) data and 59.1% of the total variation of infection type data recorded at the heading-flowering stages. Two RGAP markers, Xwgp36 and Xwgp45 with the highest R-2 values were closely linked to Yr39, should be useful for incorporation of the non-race-specific resistance gene into new cultivars and for combining Yr39 with other genes for durable and high-level resistance.

AB In cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare), six-rowed spikes produce three times as many seeds per spike as do two-rowed spikes. The determinant of this trait is the Mendelian gene vrs1, located on chromosome 2H, which is syntenous with rice (Oryza sativa) chromosomes 4 and 7. We exploited barley-rice micro-synteny to increase marker density in the vrs1 region as a prelude to its map-based cloning. The rice genomic sequence, covering a 980 kb contig, identified barley ESTs linked to vrs1. A high level of conservation of gene sequence was obtained between barley chromosome 2H and rice chromosome 4. A total of 22 EST-based STS markers were placed within the target region, and the linear order of these markers in barley and rice was identical. The genetic window containing vrs1 was narrowed from 0.5 to 0.06 cM, which facilitated covering the vrs1 region by a 518 kb barley BAC contig. An analysis of the contig sequence revealed that a rice Vrs1 orthologue is present on chromosome 7, suggesting a transposition of the chromosomal segment containing Vrs1 within barley chromosome 2H. The breakdown of micro-collinearity illustrates the limitations of synteny cloning, and stresses the importance of implementing genomic studies directly in the target species.

AB Leaf rust and stripe rust are important foliar diseases of wheat worldwide. Leaf rust and stripe rust resistant introgression lines were developed by induced homoeologous chromosome pairing between wheat chromosome 5D and 5M(g) of Aegilops geniculata ((UMg)-M-g). Characterization of rust resistant BC2F5 and BC3F6 homozygous progenies using genomic in situ hybridization with Aegilops comosa (M) DNA as probe identified three different types of introgressions; two cytologically visible and one invisible (termed cryptic alien introgression). All three types of introgression lines showed similar and complete resistance to the most prevalent pathotypes of leaf rust and stripe rust in Kansas (USA) and Punjab (India). Diagnostic polymorphisms between the alien segment and recipient parent were identified using physically mapped RFLP probes. Molecular mapping revealed that cryptic alien introgression conferring resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust comprised less than 5% of the 5DS arm and was designated T5DL center dot 5DS-5M(g)S(0.95). Genetic mapping with an F-2 population of Wichita x T5DL center dot 5DS-5M(g)S(0.95) demonstrated the monogenic and dominant inheritance of resistance to both diseases. Two diagnostic RFLP markers, previously mapped on chromosome arm 5DS, co-segregated with the rust resistance in the F-2 population. The unique map location of the resistant introgression on chromosome T5DL center dot 5DS-5M(g)S(0.95) suggested that the leaf rust and stripe rust resistance genes were new and were designated Lr57 and Yr40. This is the first documentation of a successful transfer and characterization of cryptic alien introgression from Ae. geniculata conferring resistance to both leaf rust and stripe rust in wheat.

AB A single gene controlling powdery mildew resistance was identified in the North Carolina germplasm line NC96BGTD3 (NCD3) using genetic analysis of F-2 derived lines from a NCD3 X Saluda cross. Microsatellite markers linked to this Pm gene were identified and their most likely order was Xcfd7, 10.3 cM, Xgdm43, 8.6 cM, Xcfd26, 11.9 cM, Pm gene. These markers and the Pm gene were assigned to chromosome 5DL by means of Chinese Spring Nullitetrasomic (Nulli5D-tetra5A) and ditelosomic (Dt5DL) lines. A detached leaf test showed a distinctive disease reaction to six pathogen isolates among the NCD3 Pm gene, Pm2 (5DS) and Pm34 (5DL). An allelism test showed independence between Pm34 and the NCD3 Pm gene. Together, the tests provided strong evidence for the presence of a novel Pm gene in NCD3, and this gene was designated Pm35.

AB The aim of this paper was to compare different field, laboratory and physiological methods for the evaluation of frost tolerance in barley; as well as to show both the possibilities and limitations of these individual methods and approaches. The tolerances of 39 barley cultivars and breeding lines were evaluated by four direct methods (based on the exposure of plants to frost) and three indirect (based on diagnostic traits and markers). The direct methods included the evaluation of: (1) field survival after five winters 1999-2004; (2) winter survival in a provocation pot test under natural conditions; (3) lethal temperature (LT50) of plants taken from a field in winter; and (4) LT50 of plants grown and hardened in a growth chamber. The indirect methods were based upon: (1) endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA); (2) water content (WC); (3) osmotic potential (OP) of the plants cultivated and hardened in growth chambers. All four direct methods correlated well with one another, and resulted in similar sequences of frost tolerance of the tested barley cultivars and lines. While it was only possible to distinguish individual barley cultivars based on field survival after the 2002/2003 winter, by using the provocation method it was possible to distinguish between barley cultivars after all of the winters. Moreover, the average winter survival of barley from multi-year pot tests was in correlation with the minimal LT50, evaluated in plants hardened in both the field or in growth chambers. From indirect indicators, the levels of ABA increased slightly, while WC and OP clearly decreased in all cultivars during cold hardening. No correlation was observed between LT50 and the ABA content. A significant correlation between LT50 and WC, and between LT50 and OP was found, but only after 1 or more weeks of cold acclimation of the plants had been completed, since both the duration and the rate of decline of these parameters differed in individual cultivars during the cold hardening. The LT50-values of barley cultivars not only accurately characterized their field tolerance to frost, but also were indicative of changes associated with the induction of frost tolerance in plants under the given conditions, when comparing the direct and indirect methods.

AB The aim of the pedigree-based genome mapping project is to investigate and develop systems for implementing marker assisted selection to improve the efficiency of selection and increase the rate of genetic gain in breeding programs. Pedigree-based whole genome marker application provides a vehicle for incorporating marker technologies into applied breeding programs by bridging the gap between marker-trait association and marker implementation. We report on the development of protocols for implementation of pedigree-based whole genome marker analysis in breeding programs within the Australian northern winter cereals region. Examples of applications from the Queensland DPI&F wheat and barley breeding programs are provided, commenting on the use of microsatellites and other types of molecular markers for routine genomic analysis, the integration of genotypic, phenotypic and pedigree information for targeted wheat and barley lines, the genomic impacts of strong selection pressure in case study pedigrees, and directions for future pedigree-based marker development and analysis.

AB Wild Triticeae grasses serve as important gene pools for forage and cereal crops. Understanding their genome compositions is pivotal for efficient use of this vast gene pool in germplasm-enhancement programs. Several cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed to distinguish the E-b, E-e, and R genomes. With the aid of disomic addition lines of wheat, it was confirmed that all 7 chromosomes of E-b, E-e, and R genomes carry these genome-specific CAPS markers. Thus, the identified CAPS markers are useful in detecting and monitoring the chromosomes of these 3 genomes. This study also provides evidence suggesting that some Purdue and Chinese germplasm lines developed for barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance are different from those developed in Australia. Furthermore, Thinopyrum intermedium and Thinopyrum ponticum were shown to have different genome constitutions. Sequence analyses of the 1272 bp sequences, containing Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, from the E-b, E-e, and R genomes also shed light on the evolution of these 3 genomes.

AB High yield potential and the wide adaptability of wheat-rye T1BL.1RS translocation lines are attractive to breeders. The wheat-rye lines Lankao 1, 3, 4, and 5 were resistant to a wide spectrum of wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) isolates from both China and Canada. They also were resistant to a mixture of wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) pathotypes (98WSR) and wheat stripe rust (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) races from western Canada and China. Colonization of wheat curl mite (WCM) (Aceria tosichella) resulted in slower development of rolling and trapping leaves in the Lankao lines than in the WCM-susceptible check cultivars. The delayed development of Wheat streak mosaic (WSM) symptoms on Lankao lines was observed when transmitted by viruliferous WCM, even though they were susceptible to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). This effect of Lankao lines on limiting the spread of WSM was comparable with other known sources of WCM resistance. Sequential C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization analyses revealed the presence of a pair of T1BL.1RS translocated chromosomes in the Lankao lines. Segregation analysis of the F, progeny plants derived from crosses between Larkao 4 and the susceptible wheat cvs. Mingxian 169 and Lovrin 13 indicated that a single dominant gene was responsible for the isolate-specific resistance against wheat powdery mildew in Lankao 4. Polymerase chain reaction analysis using an STS marker amplified rye chromatin in powdery mildew-resistant and -susceptible F-2 plants of the Mingxian 169 x Lankao 4 cross demonstrated that the resistance of Lankao 4 was not controlled by a gene or genes located on the rye chromosome arm of T1BL.1RS. The resistance of the Lankao lines to diseases and limitation of the spread of WSMV, in combination with good quality and high yield potential, makes them useful for wheat improvement and production.

AB Milo disease in sorghum is caused by isolates of the soil-borne fungus Periconia circinata that produce PC-toxin. Susceptibility to milo disease is conditioned by a single, semi-dominant gene, termed Pc. The susceptible allele (Pc) converts to a resistant form (pc) spontaneously at a gametic frequency of 10(-3) to 10(-4). A high-density genetic map was constructed around the Pc locus using DNA markers, allowing the Pc gene to be delimited to a 0.9 cM region on the short arm of sorghum chromosome 9. Physically, the Pc-region was covered by a single BAC clone. Sequence analysis of this BAC revealed twelve gene candidates. Several of the predicted genes in the region are homologous to disease resistance loci, including one NBS-LRR resistance gene analogue that is present in multiple tandem copies. Analysis of pc isolines derived from Pc/Pc sorghum suggests that one or more members of this NBS-LRR gene family are the Pc genes that condition susceptibility.

AB The Avena sterilis L. collection in the Plant Gene Resources of Canada (PGRC) consists of 11,235 accessions originating from 27 countries and is an invaluable source of genetic variation for genetic improvement of oats, but it has been inadequately characterized, particularly using molecular techniques. More than 35 accessions have been identified with genes for resistance to oat crown and stem rusts, but little is known about their comparative genetic diversity. This study attempted to characterize a structured sample of 369 accessions representing 26 countries and two specific groups with Puccinia coronata avenae (Pc) and Puccinia graminis avenae (Pg) resistance genes using microsatellite (SSR) markers. Screening of 230 SSR primer pairs developed from other major crop species yielded 26 informative primer pairs for this characterization. These 26 primer pairs were applied to screen all the samples and 125 detected alleles were scored for each accession. Analyses of the SSR data showed the effectiveness of the stratified sampling applied in capturing country-wise SSR variation. The frequencies of polymorphic alleles ranged from 0.01 to 0.99 and averaged 0.28. More than 90% of the SSR variation resided within accessions of a country. Accessions from Greece, Liberia, and Italy were genetically most diverse, while accessions from Egypt, Georgia, Ethiopia, Gibraltar, and Kenya were most distinct. Seven major clusters were identified, each consisting of accessions from multiple countries and specific groups, and these clusters were not well congruent with geographic origins. Accessions with Pc and Pg genes had similar levels of SSR variation, did not appear to cluster together, and were not associated with the other representative accessions. These SSR patterns are significant for understanding the progenitor species of cultivated oat, managing A. sterilis germplasm, and exploring new sources of genes for oat improvement.

AB A microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) consensus map of barley was constructed by joining six independent genetic maps based on the mapping populations 'Igri x Franka', 'Steptoe x Morex', 'OWBRec x OWBDom', 'Lina x Canada Park', 'L94 x Vada' and 'SusPtrit x Vada'. Segregation data for microsatellite markers from different research groups including SCRI (Bmac, Bmag, EBmac, EBmag, HVGeneName, scsssr), IPK (GBM, GBMS), WUR (GBM), Virginia Polytechnic Institute (HVM), and MPI for Plant Breeding (HVGeneName), generated in above mapping populations, were used in the computer program RECORD to order the markers of the individual linkage data sets. Subsequently, a framework map was constructed for each chromosome by integrating the 496 "bridge markers" common to two or more individual maps with the help of the computer programme JoinMapA (R) 3.0. The final map was calculated by following a "neighbours" map approach. The integrated map contained 775 unique microsatellite loci, from 688 primer pairs, ranging from 93 (6H) to 132 (2H) and with an average of 111 markers per linkage group. The genomic DNA-derived SSR marker loci had a higher polymorphism information content value (average 0.61) as compared to the EST/gene-derived SSR loci (average 0.48). The consensus map spans 1,068 cM providing an average density of one SSR marker every 1.38 cM. Such a high-density consensus SSR map provides barley molecular breeding programmes with a better choice regarding the quality of markers and a higher probability of polymorphic markers in an important chromosomal interval. This map also offers the possibilities of thorough alignment for the (future) physical map and implementation in haplotype diversity studies of barley.

AB Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is accompanied by goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion. Trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides represent major secretory products of the respiratory tract and are synthesized together with mucins. In the murine lung, TFF2 is mainly expressed, whereas TFF1 transcripts represent only a minor species. TFF peptides are well known for their motogenic and anti-apoptotic effects, and they modulate the inflammatory response of bronchial epithelial cells. Here, an established mouse model of asthma was investigated (i.e., exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus [AF] antigens). RT-PCR analysis of lung tissue showed elevated levels particularly of TFF I transcripts in AF-sensitized/challenged animals. In contrast, transcripts encoding Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP/CC10) were strongly diminished in these animals. For comparison, the expression of the goblet cell secretory granule marker mCLCA3/Gob-5, the mucins Muc1-Muc6 and Muc19, and the secretoglobins ScgB3A1 and ScgB3A2, as well as the mammalian ependymin-related gene MERP2, were monitored. Immunohistochemistry localized TFF1 mainly in cells with a mixed phenotype (e.g., TFF1-positive cells stain with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which recognizes mucins characteristic of goblet cells). In addition, these cells express CCSP/CC10, a Clara cell marker. When compared with mucins or CCSP/CC10, TFF1 was stored in a different population of secretory granules localized at the more basolateral portion of these cells. Thus, the results presented indicate for the first time that allergen exposure leads to the trans-differentiation of Clara cells toward a TFF1-expressing mucous phenotype.

AB Xanthomonas citri pv. citri is a clonal group of strains that causes citrus canker disease and appears to have originated in Asia. A phylogenetically distinct clonal group that causes identical disease symptoms on susceptible citnis,X. citri pv. aurantifolii, arose more recently in South America. Genomes of X. citri pv. aurantifolii strains carry two DNA fragments that hybridize to pthA, an X. citri pv. citri gene which encodes a major type Ill pathogenicity effector protein that is absolutely required to cause citrus canker. Marker interruption mutagenesis and complementation revealed that X citri pv. aurantifolii strain B69 carried one functional pthA homolog, designated pthB, that was required to cause cankers on citrus. Gene pthB was found among 38 open reading frames on a 37,106-bp plasmid, designated pXcB, which was sequenced and annotated. No additional pathogenicity effectors were found on pXcB, but 11 out of 38 open reading frames appeared to encode a type IV transfer system. pXcB transferred horizontally in planta, without added selection, from B69 to a nonpathogenic X. citri pv. citri (pthA::Tn5) mutant strain, fully restoring canker. In planta transfer efficiencies were very high (> 0.1%/recipient) and equivalent to those observed for agar medium with antibiotic selection, indicating that pthB conferred a. strong selective advantage to the recipient strain. A single pathogenicity effector that can confer a distinct selective advantage in planta may both facilitate plasmid survival following horizontal gene transfer and account for the origination of phylogenetically distinct groups of strains causing identical disease symptoms.

AB Cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is well known as one of the most widely cultivated crops in the world and as an extensively studied plant species in the field of genetics. In recent years, despite its very large genome size (ca. 5,000 Mb), the research resources needed for barley genomic studies have become available, including a large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). These have been widely used for barley genome analyses, such as DNA marker-generation and the construction of microarrays. However, the availability of a large-insert genomic library, which is also essential for genomic studies, has been relatively limited in the barley research community. We described here the construction and characterization of a barley bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, using the Japanese malting barley variety 'Haruna Nijo'. The BAC library consisted of 294,912 clones arrayed in 768 384-well microtiter plates. The average size of each cloned insert was estimated to be 115.2 kb, with approximately 0.5% of the clones lacking inserts. Chroloplast DNAs were present in about 1.7% of the library. Thus, the genomic coverage of the 'Haruna Nijo' BAC library was estimated to be about 6.6 genome-equivalents. In order to rapidly identify specific BAC clones, we developed a screening strategy that combined PCR analysis of pooled BAC DNAs with colony hybridization. Using this screening scheme, we investigated the genomic coverage of this BAC library, using 13 locus-specific ESTs and a sequence-tagged site marker. By screening the whole library with individual markers, we identified an average of 5.1 clones per marker. This screening scheme also enabled us to rapidly construct a physical contig spanning a region of approx. 190 kb around the HvBRII locus, where the mutation responsible for the semi-dwarf plant type 'uzu' is located. These results indicate that the 'Haruna Nijo' BAC library will be useful for barley genomic studies.

AB The presence of genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) complicates selection of superior genotypes and an understanding of environmental and genotypic causes of significant GEI is important in all stages of plant breeding. We present a systematic approach for understanding GEI of complex interrelated traits by combining chromosome substitution lines that allowed us to study the effects of genes on a single chromosome with a structural equation model that approximated the complex processes involving genes, environmental conditions, and traits. We applied the approach to recombinant inbred chromosome wheat lines grown in multiple environments. The final model explained 74% of the yield GEI variation and we found that spikes per square meter (SPSM) GEI had the highest direct effect on yield GEI and that the genetic markers were mostly sensitive to temperature and precipitation during the vegetative and reproductive periods. In addition, we identified a number of direct and indirect causal relationships that described how genes interacted with environmental factors to affect GEI of several important agronomic traits which would not have been possible with previously used methods.

AB Breeders face many complex choices in the design of efficient crossing and selection strategies aimed at combining desired alleles into a single target genotype. Both population genetic theory and a breeding simulation tool were used to study the effects of different strategies on population size and number of marker assays required to recover a target genotype in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Enriching the frequency of desirable alleles in the F-2 of single-cross and in the F-1 of backcross and topcross populations greatly reduced the minimum required population size, but the gain from another enrichment selection is minor. General equations were developed to determine appropriate crossing strategies, and sequential culling was proposed to minimize total marker screening costs. For a topcross of three adapted lines from an existing breeding program, simulation of changes in allele frequencies at nine target genes (seven unlinked) showed that population size was minimized with a three-stage selection strategy in the F-1 generation of the topcross (TCF1), the F-2 generation of the topcross (TCF2), and doubled haploid lines (DHs). Enrichment of allelic frequencies in TCF2 reduced the total number of lines screened from > 3500 to < 600. Eight of the genes were present at frequencies > 0.97 after selection, while the tin reduced-tillering allele was only at 0.77 in the final selected population due to its strong repulsion-phase linkage to the grain quality gene Glu-A3 in this cross and the incomplete linkage of the tin marker. Therefore, the presence of the tin gene needs to be further confirmed by other methods.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA) [Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)] is an economically significant insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in the USA. Since 1986, only one biotype existed in the USA. In 2003, a new biotype appeared which was virulent to all known resistance genes in wheat, with the exception of Dn7. Dn7 is a rye gene transferred into a wheat background via 1RS/1BL translocation. It was previously mapped; however, no PCR-based markers were developed for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and the map was sparse. This study presents a higher density map of Dn7 containing 19 markers. The markers spanning Dn7 are XHor2 and Xscb241 at distances of 1.4 and 1 cM, respectively, from Dn7 PCR markers were developed and tested on 19 wheat cultivars. Two markers which amplified rye-specific fragments proved to be useful for MAS. Xrems1303 amplified a 320-bp band only in cultivars with high-level resistance to biotype 2 and is effective for MAS of Dn7 Xib267 is linked to the susceptible locus and amplified a fragment specific for rye Petkus 1RS and would be a good marker for selecting against the susceptible locus. The value of Dn7 as a source of resistance has increased because of the broad spectrum resistance it provides against several biotypes. The markers developed in this study will be useful for facilitating the transfer of Dn7 into wheat cultivars with or without translocation chromosomes containing 1RS.

AB Key message Advances have been made in our understanding of Ascochyta blight resistance genetics through mapping candidate genes associated with QTL regions and demonstrating the importance of epistatic interactions in determining resistance.
   Ascochyta blight disease of pea (Pisum sativum L.) is economically significant with worldwide distribution. The causal pathogens are Didymella pinodes, Phoma medicaginis var pinodella and, in South Australia, P. koolunga. This study aimed to identify candidate genes that map to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Ascochyta blight field disease resistance and to explore the role of epistatic interactions. Candidate genes associated with QTL were identified beginning with 101 defence-related genes from the published literature. Synteny between pea and Medicago truncatula was used to narrow down the candidates for mapping. Fourteen pea candidate sequences were mapped in two QTL mapping populations, A26 x Rovar and A88 x Rovar. QTL peaks, or the intervals containing QTL peaks, for the Asc2.1, Asc4.2, Asc4.3 and Asc7.1 QTL were defined by four of these candidate genes, while another three candidate genes occurred within 1.0 LOD confidence intervals. Epistasis involving QTL x background marker and background marker x background marker interactions contributed to the disease response phenotypes observed in the two mapping populations. For each population, five pairwise interactions exceeded the 5 % false discovery rate threshold. Two candidate genes were involved in significant pairwise interactions. Markers in three genomic regions were involved in two or more epistatic interactions. Therefore, this study has identified pea defence-related sequences that are candidates for resistance determination, and that may be useful for marker-assisted selection. The demonstration of epistasis informs breeders that the architecture of this complex quantitative resistance includes epistatic interactions with non-additive effects.

AB Key message Models based on additive marker effects and on epistatic interactions can be translated into genomic relationship models. This equivalence allows to perform predictions based on complex gene interaction models and reduces computational effort significantly.
   In the theory of genome-assisted prediction, the equivalence of a linear model based on independent and identically normally distributed marker effects and a model based on multivariate Gaussian distributed breeding values with genomic relationship as covariance matrix is well known. In this work, we demonstrate equivalences of marker effect models incorporating epistatic interactions and corresponding mixed models based on relationship matrices and show how to exploit these equivalences computationally for genome-assisted prediction. In particular, we show how models with epistatic interactions of higher order (e.g., three-factor interactions) translate into linear models with certain covariance matrices and demonstrate how to construct epistatic relationship matrices for the linear mixed model, if we restrict the model to interactions defined a priori. We illustrate the practical relevance of our results with a publicly available data set on grain yield of wheat lines growing in four different environments. For this purpose, we select important interactions in one environment and use this knowledge on the network of interactions to increase predictive ability of grain yield under other environmental conditions. Our results provide a guide for building relationship matrices based on knowledge on the structure of trait-related gene networks.

AB Key message Genetically stable deletion lines of Agropyron cristatum chromosome 6P in common wheat background were generated, which allowed for physical mapping of 255 6P-specific STS markers and leaf rust resistance gene(s).
   Chromosomal deletion lines are valuable tools for gene discovery and localization. The chromosome 6P of Agropyron cristatum (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) confers many desirable agronomic traits to common wheat, such as higher grain number per spike, multiple fertile tiller number, and enhanced resistance to certain diseases. Although many elite genes from A. cristatum have been identified, their chromosomal locations were largely undetermined due to the lack of A. cristatum 6P deletion lines. In this study, various A. cristatum 6P deletion lines were developed using a wheat-A. cristatum 6P disomic addition line 4844-12 subjected to Co-60-gamma irradiation as well as an Aegilops cylindrica gametocidal chromosome. Twenty-six genetically stable A. cristatum 6P deletion lines in the genetic background of common wheat were obtained, and their genetic constitutions were elucidated by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers specific to A. cristatum chromosome 6P. Moreover, 255 novel chromosome 6P-specific STS markers were physically mapped to 14 regions of chromosome 6P. Field evaluation of leaf rust resistance of various deletion lines and BC1F2 populations indicated that the A.cristatum chromosome 6P-originated leaf rust resistance gene(s) was located in the region 6PS-0.81-1.00. This study will provide not only useful tools for characterization and utilization of wheat materials with alien chromosomal segments, but also novel wheat germplasms potentially valuable in wheat breeding and improvement.

AB Key message Wheat- Secale cereanum addition lines with yellow rust resistance (6R) and increased arabinoxylan content (1R, 4R, 6R) have been selected and identified in order to increase biodiversity of wheat.
   Perennial rye (Secale cereanum, 2n = 2x = 14, RR) cultivar Kriszta has a large gene pool that can be exploited in wheat breeding. It has high protein and dietary fibre content, carries several resistance genes, tolerant to frost and drought, and adapts well to disadvantageous soil and weather conditions. In order to incorporate agronomically useful features from this perennial rye into cultivated wheat, backcross progenies derived from a cross between the wheat line Mv9kr1 and perennial rye 'Kriszta' have been produced, and addition lines disomic for 1R, 4R and 6R chromosomes have been selected using GISH, FISH and SSR markers. Quality measurements showed that addition of 'Kriszta' chromosomes 4R and 6R to the wheat genome had increased the total protein content. The 4R addition line contained slightly, while 1R and 6R additions significantly higher amount of arabinoxylan than the parental wheat line. Besides this, the 6R addition line appeared to be resistant to yellow rust in highly infected nurseries, consequently it may carry a new effective gene different from that harboured in the 1RS.1BL translocation for resistance to this disease.

AB Key message We cloned TaSST genes, developed a gene-specific marker for TaSST - D1 , and identified three QTL in the Doumai/Shi 4185 RIL population. TaSST - D1 is within one of the three QTL.
   Sucrose:sucrose-1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST), a critical enzyme in the fructan biosynthetic pathway, is significantly and positively associated with water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in bread wheat stems. In the present study, wheat 1-SST genes (TaSST) were isolated and located on chromosomes 4A, 7A and 7D. Sequence analysis of TaSST-D1 revealed 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the third exon between cultivars with higher and lower WSC content. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) marker, WSC7D, based on the polymorphism at position 1216 (C-G) was developed to discriminate the two alleles. WSC7D was located on chromosome 7DS using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a Doumai/Shi 4185 cross, and a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. TaSST-D1 co-segregated with the CAPS marker WSC7D and was linked to SNP marker BS00108793_51 on chromosome 7DS at a genetic distance of 6.1 cM. It explained 8.8, 10.9, and 11.3 % of the phenotypic variances in trials at Beijing and Shijiazhuang as well as the averaged data from those environments, respectively. Two additional QTL (QWSC.caas-4BS and QWSC.caas-7AS) besides TaSST-D1 were mapped in the RIL population. One hundred and forty-nine Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines tested in four environments were used to validate a highly significant (P < 0.01) association between WSC7D and WSC content in wheat stems. WSC7D can be used as a gene-specific marker for improvement of stem WSC content in wheat breeding programs.

TI Island-Model Genomic Selection for Long-Term Genetic Improvement of
   Autogamous Crops
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; JAPANESE RICE POPULATION; TRAITS
AB Acceleration of genetic improvement of autogamous crops such as wheat and rice is necessary to increase cereal production in response to the global food crisis. Population and pedigree methods of breeding, which are based on inbred line selection, are used commonly in the genetic improvement of autogamous crops. These methods, however, produce a few novel combinations of genes in a breeding population. Recurrent selection promotes recombination among genes and produces novel combinations of genes in a breeding population, but it requires inaccurate single-plant evaluation for selection. Genomic selection (GS), which can predict genetic potential of individuals based on their marker genotype, might have high reliability of single-plant evaluation and might be effective in recurrent selection. To evaluate the efficiency of recurrent selection with GS, we conducted simulations using real marker genotype data of rice cultivars. Additionally, we introduced the concept of an "island model" inspired by evolutionary algorithms that might be useful to maintain genetic variation through the breeding process. We conducted GS simulations using real marker genotype data of rice cultivars to evaluate the efficiency of recurrent selection and the island model in an autogamous species. Results demonstrated the importance of producing novel combinations of genes through recurrent selection. An initial population derived from admixture of multiple bi-parental crosses showed larger genetic gains than a population derived from a single bi-parental cross in whole cycles, suggesting the importance of genetic variation in an initial population. The island-model GS better maintained genetic improvement in later generations than the other GS methods, suggesting that the island-model GS can utilize genetic variation in breeding and can retain alleles with small effects in the breeding population. The island-model GS will become a new breeding method that enhances the potential of genomic selection in autogamous crops, especially bringing long-term improvement.

AB Metabolic changes in spikelets of wheat varieties FL62R1, Stettler, Muchmore and Sumai3 following Fusarium graminearum infection were explored using NMR analysis. Extensive 1D and 2D H-1 NMR measurements provided information for detailed metabolite assignment and quantification leading to possible metabolic markers discriminating resistance level in wheat subtypes. In addition, metabolic changes that are observed in all studied varieties as well as wheat variety specific changes have been determined and discussed. A new method for metabolite quantification from NMR data that automatically aligns spectra of standards and samples prior to quantification using multivariate linear regression optimization of spectra of assigned metabolites to samples' 1D spectra is described and utilized. Fusarium infection-induced metabolic changes in different wheat varieties are discussed in the context of metabolic network and resistance.

AB To effectively use elite genes on the long arm of rye chromosome 6 (the 6RL arm) in wheat breeding programs, precise and fast identification of 6RL chromatin in wheat backgrounds is necessary. PCR-based 6RL-specific markers can facilitate the detection of elite genes on 6RL in wheat breeding. However, only a limited number of 6RL-specific markers have been developed. In the present study, 300 new PCR-based 6RL-specific markers were identified using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, and were further physically mapped to four regions on the 6RL arm using 6R and 6RL deletion lines. Interestingly, 127 of the 300 markers were physically localized to a region from the site between 2.3 and 2.5 to the telomere, the same region where the powdery mildew resistance gene was mapped. In addition, 95 of the 300 markers exhibit polymorphisms, which can be used to investigate the diversity of rye 6RL arms. The markers developed in this study can be used to identify given segments of 6RL in wheat backgrounds and accelerate the utilization of elite genes on 6RL in wheat breeding.

AB Genetic characterization, diversity analysis and estimate of the genetic relationship among varieties using functional and random DNA markers linked to agronomic traits can provide relevant guidelines in selecting parents and designing new breeding strategies for marker-assisted wheat cultivar improvement. Here, we characterize 20 Moroccan and 19 exotic bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars using 47 functional and 7 linked random DNA markers associated with 21 loci of the most important traits for wheat breeding. The functional marker analysis revealed that 35, 45, and 10 % of the Moroccan cultivars, respectively have the rust resistance genes (Lr34/Yr18/Pm38), dwarfing genes (Rht1b or Rht2b alleles) and the leaf rust resistance gene (Lr68). The marker alleles for genes Lr37/Yr17/Sr38, Sr24 and Yr36 were present only in the exotic cultivars and absent in Moroccan cultivars. 25 % of cultivars had 1BL. 1RS translocation. 70 % of the wheat cultivars had Ppo-D1a and Ppo-A1b associated with low polyphenol oxidase activity. 10 % of cultivars showed presence of a random DNA marker allele (175 bp) linked to Hessian fly resistance gene H22. The majority of the Moroccan cultivars were carrying alleles that impart good bread making quality. Neighbor joining (NJ) and principal coordinate analysis based on the marker data revealed a clear differentiation between elite Moroccan and exotic wheat cultivars. The results of this study are useful for selecting suitable parents for making targeted crosses in marker-assisted wheat breeding and enhancing genetic diversity in the wheat cultivars.

AB Non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) have many health benefits, including immunomodulatory activity, lowering serum cholesterol, a faecal bulking effect, enhanced absorption of certain minerals, prebiotic effects and the amelioration of type II diabetes. The principal components of the NSP in cereal grains are (1,3; 1,4)-beta-glucans and arabinoxylans. Although (1,3; 1,4)-beta-glucan (hereafter called beta-glucan) is not the most representative component of wheat cell walls, it is one of the most important types of soluble fibre in terms of its proven beneficial effects on human health. In the present work we explored the genetic variability of beta-glucan content in grains from a tetraploid wheat collection that had been genotyped with a 90k-iSelect array, and combined this data to carry out an association analysis. The beta-glucan content, expressed as a percentage w/w of grain dry weight, ranged from 0.18% to 0.89% across the collection. Our analysis identified seven genomic regions associated with a-glucan, located on chromosomes 1A, 2A (two), 2B, 5B and 7A (two), confirming the quantitative nature of this trait. Analysis of marker trait associations (MTAs) in syntenic regions of several grass species revealed putative candidate genes that might influence A-glucan levels in the endosperm, possibly via their participation in carbon partitioning. These include the glycosyl hydrolases endo-beta-(1,4)-glucanase (cellulase), beta-amylase, (1,4)-beta-xylan endohydrolase, xylanase inhibitor protein I, isoamylase and the glycosyl transferase starch synthase II.

AB Genetic transformation is one of the most widely used technique in crop improvement. However, most of the binary vectors used in this technique, especially cloning based, contain antibiotic genes as selection marker that raise serious consumer and environmental concerns; moreover, they could be transferred to non-target hosts with deleterious effects. Therefore, the goal of this study was reconstruction of the widely used pBI121 binary vector by substituting the harmful antibiotic selection marker gene with a less-harmful selection marker, Basta (herbicide resistance gene). The generated vectors were designated as pBI121NB and pBI121CB, in which Basta gene was expressed under the control of Nos or CaMV 35S promoter, respectively. The successful integration of the new inserts into both the vectors was confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing. Both these vectors were used in transforming Arabidopsis, Egyptian wheat and barley varieties using LBA4404 and GV3101 Agrobacterium strains. The surfactant Tween-20 resulted in an efficient transformation and the number of Arabidopsis transformants was about 6-9 %. Soaked seeds of wheat and barley were transformed with Agrobacterium to introduce the bacteria to the growing shoot apices. The percentage of transgenic lines was around 16-17 and 14-15 % for wheat and barley, respectively. The quantitative studies presented in this work showed that both LBA4404 and GV3101 strains were suitable for transforming Egyptian wheat and barley.

AB Alien addition lines are important for transferring useful genes from alien species into common wheat. Rye is an important and valuable gene resource for improving wheat disease resistance, yield, and environment adaptation. A new wheat-rye addition line, N9436B, was developed from the progeny of the cross of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) cultivar Shaanmai 611 and rye (Secale cereal L., 2n = 2x = 14, RR) accession Austrian rye. We characterized this new line by cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular markers, and disease resistance screening. N9436B was stable in morphology and cytology, with a chromosome composition of 2n = 42 + 2t = 22II. GISH investigations showed that this line contained two rye chromosomes. GISH, FISH, and molecular maker identification suggested that the introduced R chromosome and the missing wheat chromosome arms were 1R chromosome and 2DL chromosome arm, respectively. N9436B exhibited 30-37 spikelets per spike and a high level of resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) isolate E09 at the seedling stage. N9436B was cytologically stable, had the trait of multiple spikelets, and was resistant to powdery mildew; this line should thus be useful in wheat improvement.

AB The objective of this research was to characterize the high level of resistance to stripe that has been observed in the released wheat cultivar, Chuanmai45. A combination of classic genetic analysis, molecular and cytogenetic methods were used to characterize resistance in an F-2 population derived from Chuanmai45 and the susceptible Chuanmai42. Inheritance of resistance was shown to be conferred by two genes in Chuanmai45. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used along with segregation studies to show that one gene was located on a 1RS.1BL translocation. Molecular markers were employed to show that the other locus was located on chromosome 4B. The defeated gene, Yr24/26, on chromosome 1BL was present in the susceptible parent and lines that recombined this gene with the 1RS.1BL translocation were identified. The germplasm, loci, and associated markers identified in this study will be useful for application in breeding programs utilizing marker-assisted selection.

AB Generating a contiguous, ordered reference sequence of a complex genome such as hexaploid wheat (2n=6x=42; approximately 17GB) is a challenging task due to its large, highly repetitive, and allopolyploid genome. In wheat, ordering of whole-genome or hierarchical shotgun sequencing contigs is primarily based on recombination and comparative genomics-based approaches. However, comparative genomics approaches are limited to syntenic inference and recombination is suppressed within the pericentromeric regions of wheat chromosomes, thus, precise ordering of physical maps and sequenced contigs across the whole-genome using these approaches is nearly impossible. We developed a whole-genome radiation hybrid (WGRH) resource and tested it by genotyping a set of 115 randomly selected lines on a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. At the whole-genome level, 26299 SNP markers were mapped on the RH panel and provided an average mapping resolution of approximately 248Kb/cR(1500) with a total map length of 6866 cR(1500). The 7296 unique mapping bins provided a five- to eight-fold higher resolution than genetic maps used in similar studies. Most strikingly, the RH map had uniform bin resolution across the entire chromosome(s), including pericentromeric regions. Our research provides a valuable and low-cost resource for anchoring and ordering sequenced BAC and next generation sequencing (NGS) contigs. The WGRH developed for reference wheat line Chinese Spring (CS-WGRH), will be useful for anchoring and ordering sequenced BAC and NGS based contigs for assembling a high-quality, reference sequence of hexaploid wheat. Additionally, this study provides an excellent model for developing similar resources for other polyploid species.

AB Transgenic chilli pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants tolerant to salinity stress were produced by introducing the wheat Na+/H+? antiporter gene (TaNHX2) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Cotyledonary explants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring a binary vector pBin438 that contains a wheat antiporter (TaNHX2) gene driven by the double CaMV 35S promoter and NPT II gene as a selectable marker. PCR and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the TaNHX2 gene had been integrated and expressed in the T-1 generation of transgenic pepper plants as compared to the non-transformed plants. Southern blot analysis further verified the integration and presence of TaNHX2 gene in the genome of chilli pepper plants. Biochemical assays of these transgenic plants revealed enhanced levels of proline, chlorophyll, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, relative water content, and reduced levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde compared to wild-type plants under salt stress conditions. The present investigation clearly showed that overexpression of the TaNHX2 gene enhanced salt stress tolerance in transgenic chilli pepper plants.

AB Aegilops geniculata Roth is an important germplasm resource for the transfer of beneficial genes into common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A new disomic addition line NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 was developed from the BC1F6 progeny of the cross wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS)/Ae. geniculata SY159//CS. We characterized this new line by morphological and cytogenetic identification, analysis of functional molecular markers, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and disease resistance evaluation. Cytological observations suggested that NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 contained 44 chromosomes and formed 22 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. The GISH investigations showed that the line contained 42 wheat chromosomes and a pair of Ae. geniculata chromosomes. EST-STS multiple loci markers and PLUG (PCR-based landmark unique gene) markers confirmed that the introduced Ae. geniculata chromosomes belonged to homoeologous group 7. FISH identification suggested that NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 possessed an additional pair of 7M(g) chromosomes, and at the same time, there were structural differences in a pair of 6D chromosomes between NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 and TA7661 (CS-AEGEN DA 7M(g)). After inoculation with powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) isolates E09, NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 exhibited a powdery mildew resistance infection type different from that of TA7661, and we conclude that the powdery mildew resistance of NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 originated from its parent Ae. geniculata SY159. Therefore, NA0973-5-4-1-2-9-1 can be used as a donor source for introducing novel disease resistance genes into wheat during breeding programs with the assistance of molecular and cytogenetic markers.

AB Fusarium graminearum Schwabe (Fusarium head blight, FHB) and Puccinia triticina Eriks (leaf rust) are two major fungal pathogens posing a continuous threat to the wheat crop; consequently, identifying resistance genes from various sources is always of importance to wheat breeders. We identified tightly linked single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the FHB resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) Qfhs. pur-7EL and the leaf rust resistance locus Lr19 using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) in a wheat-tall wheatgrass introgression-derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. One thousand and seven hundred high-confidence SNPs were used to conduct the linkage and QTL analysis. Qfhs. pur-7EL was mapped to a 2.9 cM region containing four markers within a 43.6 cM segment of wheatgrass chromosome 7el(2) that was translocated onto wheat chromosome 7DL. Lr19 from 7el(1) was mapped to a 1.21 cM region containing two markers in the same area, in repulsion. Five lines were identified with the resistance-associated SNP alleles for Qfhs. pur-7EL and Lr19 in coupling. Two SNP markers in the Qfhs. pur-7EL region were converted into PCR-based KASP markers. Investigation of the genetic characteristics of the parental lines of this RIL population indicated that they are translocation lines in two different wheat cultivar genetic backgrounds instead of 7E-7D substitution lines in Thatcher wheat background, as previously reported in the literature.

AB The cereal cyst nematode (CCN) has a significant negative impact on production of wheat in China. The presence of pathotypes of both Heterodera avenae and H. filipjevi makes it necessary to identify genetic resources with a wide spectrum of resistance. Results of this study confirmed that the soft white winter wheat 'Madsen' was resistant to many different populations of both H. filipjevi and H. avenae in both naturally infested fields and artificial inoculation tests in China. Fewer juvenile nematodes penetrated roots of Madsen than susceptible `Wenmai 19' in the early stages of the interaction between the nematodes and plant. Testing wheat cultivars in the pedigree of Madsen demonstrated that the CCN resistance of Madsen was inherited from `VPM1' via the line `VPM1/Moisson 951'. Presence of a 2NS chromosome segment from Aegilops ventricosa was detected in Madsen using a Vrga/D-specific marker. However, it appears that gene Pm4b for resistance to powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) was not transferred from VPM1 into Madsen because these cultivars had different reaction patterns against 20 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates from China. Madsen serves as an effective source of host resistance from damage caused by CCN.

AB The C1-2i wheat Q-type C2H2 zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcription factor subclass has been reported to play important roles in plant stress responses. This subclass of ZFPs has not been studied in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and we aimed to identify all members of this subclass and evaluate their responses to different abiotic stresses causing oxidative stress. Exploiting the recently published wheat draft genome sequence, we identified 53 members (including homoeologs from A, B and D genomes) of the C1-2i wheat Q-type C2H2 ZFPs (TaZFPs) representing 21 genes. Evolution analysis revealed that 9 TaZFPs members are directly inherited from the parents Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii, while 15 diverged through neoploidization events. This TaZFP subclass is responsive to the oxidative stress generator H2O2 and to high light, drought stress and flooding. Most TaZFPs are responsive to H2O2 (37/53), high light (44/53), flooding (31/53) or drought (37/53); 32 TaZFPs were up-regulated by at least 3 stresses and 16 were responsive to all stresses tested. A large number of these TaZFPs were physically mapped on different wheat draft genome sequences with known markers useful for QTL mapping. Our results show that the C1-2i subclass of TaZFPs is associated with responses to different abiotic stresses and that most TaZFPs (30/53 or 57 %) are located on group 5 chromosomes known to be involved in environment adaptation. Detailed characterization of these novel wheat TaZFPs and their association to QTL or eQTL may help to design wheat cultivars with improved tolerance to abiotic stress.

AB The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 was physically and comparatively mapped by newly developed markers. Seven candidate genes were verified to be required for Pm21 -mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew.
   Pm21, a gene derived from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum, has been transferred into common wheat and widely utilized in wheat resistance breeding for powdery mildew. Previously, Pm21 has been located to the bin FL0.45-0.58 of 6VS by using deletion stocks. However, its fine mapping is still a hard work. In the present study, 30 gene-derived 6VS-specific markers were obtained based on the collinearity among genomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza and Triticeae, and then physically and comparatively mapped in the bin FL0.45-0.58 and its nearby chromosome region. According to the maps, the bin FL0.45-0.58 carrying Pm21 was closely flanked by the markers 6VS-03 and 6VS-23, which further narrowed the orthologous regions to 1.06 Mb in Brachypodium and 1.38 Mb in rice, respectively. Among the conserved genes shared by Brachypodium and rice, four serine/threonine protein kinase genes (DvMPK1, DvMLPK, DvUPK and DvPSYR1), one protein phosphatase gene (DvPP2C) and two transcription factor genes (DvGATA and DvWHY) were confirmed to be required for Pm21-mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) and transcriptional pattern analyses. In summary, this study gives new insights into the genetic basis of the Pm21 locus and the disease resistance pathways mediated by Pm21.

AB We uncouple host and nonhost resistance in barley to Puccinia striiformis ff. spp. hordei and tritici . We isolate, fine map, and physically anchor Rps6 to chromosome 7H in barley.
   A plant may be considered a nonhost of a pathogen if all known genotypes of a plant species are resistant to all known isolates of a pathogen species. However, if a small number of genotypes are susceptible to some known isolates of a pathogen species this plant may be considered an intermediate host. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an intermediate host for Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. We wanted to understand the genetic architecture underlying resistance to Pst and to determine whether any overlap exists with resistance to the host pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh). We mapped Pst resistance to chromosome 7H and show that host and intermediate host resistance is genetically uncoupled. Therefore, we designate this resistance locus Rps6. We used phenotypic and genotypic selection on F-2:3 families to isolate Rps6 and fine mapped the locus to a 0.1 cM region. Anchoring of the Rps6 locus to the barley physical map placed the region on a single fingerprinted contig spanning a physical region of 267 kb. Efforts are now underway to sequence the minimal tiling path and to delimit the physical region harboring Rps6. This will facilitate additional marker development and permit identification of candidate genes in the region.

AB Different thermal environments impose strong, differential selection on populations, leading to local adaptation, but the genetic basis of thermal adaptation is poorly understood. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici to study the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation and identify candidate genes. Four wild-type strains originating from the same thermal environment were crossed to generate two mapping populations with 263 (cross 1) and 261 (cross 2) progeny. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was used to genotype 9745 (cross 1) and 7333 (cross 2) single-nucleotide polymorphism markers segregating within the mapping population. Temperature sensitivity was assessed using digital image analysis of colonies growing at two different temperatures. We identified four QTLs for temperature sensitivity, with unique QTLs found in each cross. One QTL had a logarithm of odds score 411 and contained only six candidate genes, including PBS2, encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase associated with low temperature tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This and other QTLs showed evidence for pleiotropy among growth rate, melanization and growth morphology, suggesting that many traits can be correlated with thermal adaptation in fungi. Higher temperatures were highly correlated with a shift to filamentous growth among the progeny in both crosses. We show that thermal adaptation has a complex genetic architecture, with natural populations of Z. tritici harboring significant genetic variation for this trait. We conclude that Z. tritici populations have the potential to adapt rapidly to climate change and expand into new climatic zones.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been used to detect QTLs underlying complex traits in major crops. In this study, we collected 218 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) lines including wild barley and cultivated barley from China, Canada, Australia, and Europe. A total of 408 polymorphic markers were used for population structure and LD analysis. GWAS for acid soil resistance were performed on the population using a general linkage model (GLM) and a mixed linkage model (MLM), respectively. A total of 22 QTLs (quantitative trait loci) were detected with the GLM and MLM analyses. Two QTLs, close to markers bPb-1959 (133.1 cM) and bPb-8013 (86.7 cM), localized on chromosome 1H and 4H respectively, were consistently detected in two different trials with both the GLM and MLM analyses. Furthermore, bPb-8013, the closest marker to the major Al3+ resistance gene HvAACT1 in barley, was identified to be QTL5. The QTLs could be used in marker-assisted selection to identify and pyramid different loci for improved acid soil resistance in barley.

AB Plants must respond to environmental cues and schedule their development in order to react to periods of abiotic stress and commit fully to growth and reproduction under favorable conditions. This study was initiated to identify SNP markers for characters expressed from the seedling stage to plant maturity in spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes adapted to western Canada. Three doubled haploid populations with the winter cultivar 'Norstar' as a common parent were developed and genotyped with a 90K Illumina iSelect SNP assay and a 2,998.9 cM consensus map with 17,541 markers constructed. High heritability's reflected large differences among the parents and relatively low genotype by environment interactions for all characters considered. Significant QTL were detected for the 15 traits examined. However, different QTL for days to heading in controlled environments and the field provided a strong reminder that growth and development are being orchestrated by environmental cues and caution should be exercised when extrapolating conclusions from different experiments. A QTL on chromosome 6A for minimum final leaf number, which determines the rate of phenological development in the seedling stage, was closely linked to QTL for low-temperature tolerance, grain quality, and agronomic characters expressed up to the time of maturity. This suggests phenological development plays a critical role in programming subsequent outcomes for many traits. Transgressive segregation was observed for the lines in each population and QTL with additive effects were identified suggesting that genes for desirable traits could be stacked using Marker Assisted Selection. QTL were identified for characters that could be transferred between the largely isolated western Canadian spring and winter wheat gene pools demonstrating the opportunities offered by Marker Assisted Selection to act as bridges in the identification and transfer of useful genes among related genetic islands while minimizing the drag created by less desirable genes.

AB Saccharum spontaneum L. is a crucial wild parent of modern sugarcane cultivars whose ploidy clones have been utilized successfully in improving the stress resistance and yield related traits of sugarcane cultivars. To establish knowledge regarding the genetic variances and evolutional relationships of ploidy clones of Saccharum spontaneum collected in China, the rDNA-ITS sequences of 62 ploidy clones including octaploid clones (2n = 64), nonaploid clones (2n = 72), decaploid clones (2n = 80), and dodecaploid clones (2n = 96), were obtained and analyzed. The rDNA-ITS sequences of four species from Saccharumand Sorghumbicolor selected as controls. The results showed that decaploid clones (2n = 80) possess the most abundant variances with 58 variable sites and 20 parsim-informative sites in ITS sequences, which were then followed by octaploid clones with 43 variable sites and 17 parsim-informative sites. In haplotype diversity, all four population exhibited high diversity, especially nonaploid and decaploid populations. By comparing the genetic distances among four ploidy populations, the dodecaploid population exhibited the closest relationship with the nonaploid population, and then the relationship strength decreased successively for the decaploid population and then for the octaploid population. Population differentiation analysis showed that the phenomena of population differentiation were not found among different ploidy populations, and low coefficient of gene differentiation(Gst) and high gene flow(Nm) occur among these populations possessing close genetic relationship. These results mentioned above will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of different ploidy populations of Saccharumspontaneum and provide vital knowledge for their utilization in sugarcane breeding and innovation.

AB BACKGROUNDHigh-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) play a critical role in determining the viscoelastic properties of wheat. Mutations induced by ion beam radiation have been applied to improve the yield and quality of crop. In this study, HMW-GS-deficient mutant lines were selected and the effects of Glu-1 loci deletion on wheat quality properties were illustrated according to the analysis of dry seeds of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Xiaoyan 81 treated with a nitrogen ion beam.
   RESULTSThree HMW-GS-deficient mutant lines were obtained and then detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Large-chromosome-fragment deletion resulted in specific deficiencies, and the deleted region sizes were determined using molecular markers. Agronomic characters, quantity and proportion of glutenins and dough microstructure of the deletion lines all proved to be quite different from those of wild-type Xiaoyan 81. Analysis of quality properties suggested that GluA1(-) had superior property parameters, while GluB1(-) and GluD1(-) both showed a significant decrease in quality properties compared with Xiaoyan 81.
   CONCLUSIONThe effects of the three Glu-1 loci on flour and dough quality-related parameters should be Glu-D1 > Glu-B1 > Glu-A1. Ion beam radiation can be used as a mutagen to create new crop mutants. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Background: Aluminium (Al) toxicity is the main factor limiting the crop production in acid soils and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most Al-sensitive of the small-grained cereals. The major gene for Al tolerance in barley is HvAACT1 (HvMATE) on chromosome 4H which encodes a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) protein. The HvAACT1 protein facilitates the Al-activated release of citrate from root apices which protects the growing cells and enables root elongation to continue. A 1 kb transposable element-like insert in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of HvAACT1 is associated with increased gene expression and tolerance and a PCR-based marker is available to score for this insertion.
   Results: We screened a wide range of barley genotypes for Al tolerance and identified a moderately tolerant Chinese genotype named CXHKSL which did not show the typical allele in the 5' UTR of HvAACT1 associated with tolerance. We investigated the mechanism of Al tolerance in CXHKSL and concluded it also relies on the Al-activated release of citrate from roots. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of double haploid lines generated with CXHKSL and the Al-sensitive variety Gairdner mapped the tolerance locus to the same region as HvAACT1 on chromosome 4H.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the Chinese barley genotype CXHKSL possesses a novel allele of the major Al tolerance gene HvAACT1.

AB Purpose To transfer the 2S chromosomal fragment(s) of Aegilops kotschyi (2S(k)) into the bread wheat genome which could lead to the biofortification of wheat with high grain iron and zinc content.Materials and methods Wheat-Ae. kotschyi 2A/2S(k) substitution lines with high grain iron and zinc content were used to transfer the gene/loci for high grain Fe and Zn content into wheat using seed irradiation approach.Results Bread wheat plants derived from 40 krad-irradiated seeds showed the presence of univalents and multivalents during meiotic metaphase-I. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis of seed irradiation hybrid F-2 seedlings showed several terminal and interstitial signals indicated the introgression of Ae. kotschyi chromosome segments. This proves the efficacy of seed radiation hybrid approach in gene transfer experiments. All the radiation-treated hybrid plants with high grain Fe and Zn content were analyzed with wheat group 2 chromosome-specific polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers to identify the introgression of small alien chromosome fragment(s).Conclusion Radiation-induced hybrids showed more than 65% increase in grain iron and 54% increase in Zn contents with better harvest index than the elite wheat cultivar WL711 indicating effective and compensating translocations of 2S(k) fragments into wheat genome.

AB Wheat kernel shape and size has been under selection since early domestication. Kernel morphology is a major consideration in wheat breeding, as it impacts grain yield and quality. A population of 160 recombinant inbred lines (RIL), developed using an elite (ND 705) and a nonadapted genotype (PI 414566), was extensively phenotyped in replicated field trials and genotyped using Infinium iSelect 90K assay to gain insight into the genetic architecture of kernel shape and size. A high density genetic map consisting of 10,172 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, with an average marker density of 0.39 cM/marker, identified a total of 29 genomic regions associated with six grain shape and size traits; similar to 80% of these regions were associated with multiple traits. The analyses showed that kernel length (KL) and width (KW) are genetically independent, while a large number (similar to 59%) of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for kernel shape traits were in common with genomic regions associated with kernel size traits. The most significant QTL was identified on chromosome 4B, and could be an ortholog of major rice grain size and shape gene GS3 or qGL3. Major and stable loci also were identified on the homeologous regions of Group 5 chromosomes, and in the regions of TaGW2 (6A) and TaGASR7 (7A) genes. Both parental genotypes contributed equivalent positive QTL alleles, suggesting that the nonadapted germplasm has a great potential for enhancing the gene pool for grain shape and size. This study provides new knowledge on the genetic dissection of kernel morphology, with a much higher resolution, which may aid further improvement in wheat yield and quality using genomic tools.

AB Water availability is a major limiting factor for crop production, making drought adaptation and its many component traits a desirable attribute of plant cultivars. Previous studies in cereal crops indicate that root traits expressed at early plant developmental stages, such as seminal root angle and root number, are associated with water extraction at different depths. Here, we conducted the first study to map seminal root traits in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Using a recently developed high-throughput phenotyping method, a panel of 30 barley genotypes and a doubled-haploid (DH) population (ND24260 x 'Flagship') comprising 330 lines genotyped with diversity array technology (DArT) markers were evaluated for seminal root angle (deviation from vertical) and root number under controlled environmental conditions. A high degree of phenotypic variation was observed in the panel of 30 genotypes: 13.5 to 82.2 and 3.6 to 6.9 degrees for root angle and root number, respectively. A similar range was observed in the DH population: 16.4 to 70.5 and 3.6 to 6.5 degrees for root angle and number, respectively. Seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seminal root traits (root angle, two QTL; root number, five QTL) were detected in the DH population. A major QTL influencing both root angle and root number (RAQ2/RNQ4) was positioned on chromosome 5HL. Across-species analysis identified 10 common genes underlying root trait QTL in barley, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Here, we provide insight into seminal root phenotypes and provide a first look at the genetics controlling these traits in barley.

AB Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), reduces genotyping costs and allows breeders to genotype large populations with thousands of markers. Genome-wide association studies with GBS markers can be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important traits in elite populations of soft red winter wheat (SRWW; Triticum aestivum L.). Our objective was to identify potential QTL for grain yield (GY), Fusarium head blight resistance (FHB), flour yield (FY), and softness equivalence (SE) in a set of 470 elite SWRR wheat lines that were genotyped with 33,169 GBS markers and phenotyped in multiple environments. For all traits, we found lines that were phenotypically superior to the elite checks. We identified four FHB QTL, nine QTL for quality, and 14 QTL for with R-2 values ranging from 1.6 to 3.5%. The QTL with the largest effect for FHB resistance reduced disease by 1.76%. For quality, the largest-effect QTL increased FY and SE by 0.37 and 0.67%, respectively. For GY the QTL with the largest effect in Wooster, OH, increased GY by 129.6 kg ha(-1), for northwest Ohio, the largesteffect QTL increased GY by 67.2 kg ha(-1), and the largest-effect QTL for GY over all environments increased GY by 48.8 kg ha(-1). While markerassisted selection (MAS) for these QTL could be used to improve these traits, the preponderance of genetic variation appeared to be controlled by genes with small effect, suggesting that MAS should be used as a supplement to genomic selection.

AB Under the changing climate, early flowering is advantageous to escape terminal heat and drought. Previously during evaluation of 14 chromosome introgression lines (ILs), we found three ILs that flowered a month earlier than their wheat background Chinese Spring (CS). This paper describes the cause of the early flowering in the ILs and provides insight into the evolution of spring wheat from the winter wheat. We used specific molecular markers for Vrn genes to determine its allelic composition. Phenotypic evaluations carried out under field conditions and in a growth chamber. Unlike the winter vrn-A1 allele of CS, the spring Vrn-A1 allele of the ILs had insertions of 222 and 131-bp miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in the promoter region. Sequence analysis indicated that the 222-bp insertion is similar to an insertion in the spring genotype, Triple Dirk D. Our results ruled out any possibility of outcrossing or contamination. Without vernalization, Vrn-A1 is highly expressed in the ILs compared to CS. We attribute the early flowering of the ILs to the insertion of the MITE in the promoter of Vrn-A1. The alien chromosome might mediate this insertion.

AB A core collection of Japanese wheat varieties (JWC) consisting of 96 accessions was established based on their passport data and breeding pedigrees. To clarify the molecular basis of the JWC collection, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. Phylogenetic tree and population structure analyses using these SNP data revealed the genetic diversity and relationships among the JWC accessions, classifying them into four groups; "varieties in the Hokkaido area", "modern varieties in the northeast part of Japan", "modern varieties in the southwest part of Japan" and "classical varieties including landraces". This clustering closely reflected the history of wheat breeding in Japan. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of the JWC collection, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for three traits, namely, "days to heading in autumn sowing", "days to heading in spring sowing" and "culm length". We found significantly associated SNP markers with each trait, and some of these were closely linked to known major genes for heading date or culm length on the genetic map. Our study indicates that this JWC collection is a useful set of germplasm for basic and applied research aimed at understanding and utilizing the genetic diversity among Japanese wheat varieties.

AB Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are a group of soil microorganisms that improve plant growth and yield through a number of diverse mechanisms such as phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, production of phytohormones, and repression of soil borne pathogens. Due to high cost of chemical fertilizers and negative environmental effects, the use of PGPR as biofertilizer is advantageous for development of sustainable agriculture. The objective of this study was to develop DNA-based markers for five PGPR strains to detect these bacteria in the rhizosphere of inoculated wheat. The rhizobacterial strains included four phosphate solubilizer strains (Arthrobacter strain WP-2, Bacillus strain MP5, Rhodococcus strain M28 and Serratia strain 5D) and one phytohormone producer Azospirillum strain WS1. DNA-based markers were developed using 16S rRNA gene restriction patterns, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR), Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) and BOX-PCR. In this study, the most differentiating DNA patterns for all strains were obtained by using the BOX primer in PCR. All the strains tested as single-strain inocula resulted in improved growth of wheat plants. The inoculated strains were successfully re-isolated from wheat rhizosphere and confirmed by BOX-based DNA markers. These results indicated that BOX-PCR is a useful and highly discriminatory fingerprinting technique for rapid detection of bacterial strains.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a major biotic constraint to global wheat production. Stripe rust can be effectively controlled by developing resistant wheat varieties. This, however, requires identification of resistant sources to be used as parents in breeding programs. Molecular markers provide a quick way of detecting rust resistance genes in adapted wheat material. The present study was conducted to investigate genetic variation for markers linked with stripe rust resistance genes in 67 Pakistani adapted spring wheat varieties using 12 pairs of microsatellite and sequence tagged site markers. Seventy nine percent wheat varieties showed marker allele of Xgwm11 associated with stripe rust resistance gene Yr26, whereas 75% varieties had the Yr26 linked allele of sequence tagged site (STS) marker CYS5. Stripe rust resistance gene Yr5 was found in 45%, whereas Yr9 and Yr10 were present in 28% varieties tested based on the previously reported linked markers. Stripe rust resistance gene Yr17 was found in 10%, whereas Yr18 in 15% of varieties only. Three markers Xwe173, Xbarc181 and Xgwm140 did not produce the expected amplicons associated with the stripe rust resistance genes. Cluster analysis revealed considerable genetic variation for marker alleles linked with stripe rust resistance genes. Results of this study may be useful for wheat breeders in pyramiding stripe rust resistance genes in future wheat varieties of Pakistan through Marker Assisted Selection.

AB It has been hypothesized that the powdery mildew adult plant resistance (APR) controlled by the Pm13 gene in Aegilops longissima chweinf. & Muschl. ((SSl)-S-l) has been evolutionary transferred to Aegilops variabilis Eig. (UUSS). The molecular marker analysis and the visual evaluation of powdery mildew symptoms in Ae. variabilis and the Ae. variabilis x Secale cereale amphiploid forms (2n=6x=42, UUSSRR) showed the presence of product that corresponded to Pm13 marker and the lower infection level compared to susceptible model, respectively. This study also describes the transfer of Ae. variabilis Eig. (2n=4x=28, (UUSSv)-U-v-S-v-S-v) chromosomes, carrying powdery mildew resistance, into triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm., 2n=6x=42, AABBRR) using Ae. variabilis x S. cereale amphiploid forms. The individual chromosomes of Ae. variabilis, triticale 'Lamberto' and hybrids were characterized by genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (GISH/FISH). The chromosome configurations of obtained hybrid forms were studied at first metaphase of meiosis of pollen mother cells (PMCs) using GISH. The statistical analysis showed that the way of S-genome chromosome pairing and transmission to subsequent hybrid generations was diploid-like and had no influence on chromosome pairing of triticale chromosomes. The cytogenetic study of hybrid forms were supported by the marker-assisted selection using Pm13 marker and visual evaluation of natural infection by Blumeria graminis, that allowed to select the addition or substitution lines of hybrids carrying chromosome 3S(v) which were tolerant to the powdery mildew infection.

AB The genus Aegilops includes a number of wheat wild relatives representing a valuable gene pool for stress adaptive traits. Collection of new accessions and proper management of Aegilops germplasm is thus essential for wheat improvement progress. Among the most worldwide distributed Aegilops species, A. geniculata Roth (2n = 4x = 28), A. neglecta Req. ex Bertol. (subsp. neglecta; 2n = 4x = 28) and A. recta (Zhuk.) Chen. (syn. A. neglecta Req. ex Bertol. subsp. recta (Zhuk.) Hammer; 2n = 6x = 42) are particularly difficult to distinguish each other because of their high morphological and genomic similarities. Based on their distinct cytoplasmic lineage, we have developed two chloroplast DNA-based molecular markers that accurately discriminate A. geniculata from A. neglecta and A. recta. The use of these markers, aided by chromosome counting to differentiate A. neglecta from A. recta, has allowed to assess the accuracy of species assignment in 125 accessions from Germplasm Gene-bank collections and recent collecting expeditions. This study has revealed taxonomic mistakes or inaccuracies in 18 % of the entries examined. The ambiguous use of the same species name for the allotetraploid A. neglecta and the allohexaploid A. recta, very extended among germplasm banks and managers, is in the origin of some of the errors detected.

AB Key message QTLs for kernel characteristics and tolerance to N stress were identified, and the functions of ten known genes with regard to these traits were specified.
   Kernel size and quality characteristics in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ultimately determine the end use of the grain and affect its commodity price, both of which are influenced by the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer. This study characterized quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for kernel size and quality and examined the responses of these traits to low-N stress using a recombinant inbred line population derived from Kenong 9204 x Jing 411. Phenotypic analyses were conducted in five trials that each included low- and high-N treatments. We identified 109 putative additive QTLs for 11 kernel size and quality characteristics and 49 QTLs for tolerance to N stress, 27 and 14 of which were stable across the tested environments, respectively. These QTLs were distributed across all wheat chromosomes except for chromosomes 3A, 4D, 6D, and 7B. Eleven QTL clusters that simultaneously affected kernel size- and quality-related traits were identified. At nine locations, 25 of the 49 QTLs for N deficiency tolerance coincided with the QTLs for kernel characteristics, indicating their genetic independence. The feasibility of indirect selection of a superior genotype for kernel size and quality under high-N conditions in breeding programs designed for a lower input management system are discussed. In addition, we specified the functions of Glu-A1, Glu-B1, Glu-A3, Glu-B3, TaCwi-A1, TaSus2, TaGS2-D1, PPO-D1, Rht-B1, and Ha with regard to kernel characteristics and the sensitivities of these characteristics to N stress. This study provides useful information for the genetic improvement of wheat kernel size, quality, and resistance to N stress.

AB Key message Spot blotch disease resistance gene Sb3 was mapped to a 0.15 centimorgan (cM) genetic interval spanning a 602 kb physical genomic region on chromosome 3BS.
   Wheat spot blotch disease, caused by B. sorokiniana, is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. Although inoculum levels can be reduced by planting disease-free seed, treatment of plants with fungicides and crop rotation, genetic resistance is likely to be a robust, economical and environmentally friendly tool in the control of spot blotch. The winter wheat line 621-7-1 confers immune resistance against B. sorokiniana. Genetic analysis indicates that the spot blotch resistance of 621-7-1 is controlled by a single dominant gene, provisionally designated Sb3. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that Sb3 is located on chromosome arm 3BS linked with markers Xbarc133 and Xbarc147. Seven and twelve new polymorphic markers were developed from the Chinese Spring 3BS shotgun survey sequence contigs and 3BS reference sequences, respectively. Finally, Sb3 was mapped in a 0.15 cM genetic interval spanning a 602 kb physical genomic region of Chinese Spring chromosome 3BS. The genetic and physical maps of Sb3 provide a framework for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the spot blotch resistance.

AB Key message SNP-based QTL mapping provided useful information for novel loci that can be used in breeding programs to control tillering and improve yield in wheat via marker-assisted selection.
   Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits affecting biomass and grain yield potential in wheat. Wheat lines with very limited tillering capacity are more productive than free-tillering lines under severe drought conditions. In this study, three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were generated and used, having H461, a low-tillering genotype, as a common parent. A linkage map containing 7808 single nucleotide polymorphism loci was constructed on the basis of H461/CN16 RIL population. Three QTL controlling low tillering were identified on Chromosome (Chr.) 2D (Qltn. sicau-2D), Chr. 2B (Qltn. sicau-2B), and Chr. 5A (Qltn. sicau-5A). Qltn. sicau-2D, Qltn. sicau-2B, and Qltn. sicau-5A explained up to 19.1, 14.6, and 9.6 % of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Comparing with previous findings, Qltn. sicau-2D and Qltn. sicau-2B should thus be novel tillering QTL. The effects of these QTL were further validated in two additional RIL populations. Significant effects of Qltn. sicau-2D were detected across all growth stages in different genetic backgrounds, making it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) underlying this locus.

AB Arabinoxylans (AX) are major polymers of wheat grain cell walls and affect the end-use properties and nutritional quality. Total (TOT-AX), water-unextractable (WU-AX), and water-extractable (WE-AX) AX contents were determined in grain of 240 recombinant inbred wheat lines (RILs), derived from the cross PH82-2/Neixiang 188. A total of 195 SSR and STS markers were used to construct a genetic map and to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL). Wide ranges of variation in TOT-AX, WU-AX, and WE-AX contents were observed among the RILs, with line effects contributing the largest phenotypic variation. Broad sense heritabilities (h(2)) were 0.50, 0.38 and 0.71, respectively. Inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) identified four additive QTL for TOT-AX content on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 3B and 5B, explaining 3.7-14.6 % of the phenotypic variance (PV), among which two were involved in significant additive 9 season interactions, contributing 0.5-2.4 % of the PV. Two additive QTL for WU-AX content were identified on chromosomes 1B and 1D, accounting for 6.4 and 8.6 % of the PV, respectively; both were involved in significant additive 9 season interactions, contributing 0.6-1.4 % of the PV. Nine additive QTL for WE-AX content were identified on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2B, 3B, 5A, 5B, 6B, 7A and 7B, explaining 3.8-15.2 % of the PV, and three of them were involved in significant additive 9 season interactions, contributing 0.5-2.1 % of the PV. Two pairs of epistatic QTL, with significant epistatic 9 season interactions, were identified for TOT-AX and WU-AX contents, contributing 16.6 and 18.6 % of the PV, respectively. The QTL identified on chromosomes 1B (associated with rye secalin marker sec1), 5A, 5B and 7A showed stable effects on WE-AX content across seasons.

Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) showed that these progenies contained four new types of translocation chromosomes, labeled as TC-A, TC-L, TC-S and TC-T. The long arm of chromosome 6P originally present in the 5A. 6P translocation was subdivided into three segments between relative arm length points 0-0.32, 0.32-0.69, 0.69-1 on the centromere to telomere axis. Screening with 6P-specific EST markers allocated 24, 30, 20 and 56 EST markers to segments C-6PL-0.32, 6PL-0.32-0.69, 6PL-0.69-1, and 6PS, respectively, and markers specific to individual arms were also identified. This study provides experimental resources and tools for mining of desirable genes on the A. cristatum chromosome 6P that can be exploited in wheat breeding.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) morphological and adaptation-related traits that are controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) help define potential growing areas of a wheat cultivar. To dissect QTLs for heading date, lodging, shattering (SH), cold tolerance, plant height, spike length, spike compactness, awn length (AL) and chaff color (CC), a high-density genetic map with single nucleotide polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers were developed using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from 'Ning7840' x 'Clark'. The RILs were evaluated in eight Oklahoma environments from 2001 to 2004. A total of 31 QTLs with additive effects on different traits were mapped on most wheat chromosomes except for 1D, 3A, 3D, 4D, 6D, and 7B. Six chromosome regions showed either tightly linked QTLs or QTLs with pleiotropic effects for two to three traits. Five QTL pairs showed additive x additive effects (AA). Ten additive QTLs were involved in additive x environment (AE) effects, and one epistatic QTL was involved in AAE effects. Among nine traits evaluated only three (SH, AL, and CC) were controlled by single genes in this biparental population. Seven traits were conditioned by multiple QTLs. A total of 127 markers were tightly linked to the QTLs. The findings shed light on the inheritance of wheat morphological and adaptationrelated traits and provide DNA markers for manipulating these important traits to improve wheat production.

AB Genetic variation is prerequisite for wheat improvement. High grain yield and protein content and early maturity are some of the major objectives in global as well as Canadian wheat breeding programs. We investigated genetic diversity for earliness related and plant height reducing (Rht) genes in 82 spring wheat cultivars, registered in western Canada, through eight diagnostic DNA markers. Allelic variation was observed at the Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1 and Ppd-D1 loci but not at Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 loci in the 82 cultivars. Spring type allele of Vrn-A1 was present in 94 % cultivars, whereas only two cultivars carried spring allele of Vrn-D1. Among the four earliness related genes, the most frequent combination was Vrn-A1a, Vrn-B1, vrn-D1 and Ppd-D1b, which was found in 32 cultivars. As for the Rht genes, eight cultivars had Rht-B1b and 13 cultivars had Rht-D1b. All cultivars carrying dominant allele of Vrn-B1, photoperiod-insensitive allele of Ppd-D1 and height reducing allele of Rht-1 had shorter plants and higher grain yield but lower grain protein content. Days to heading and maturity showed positive genetic (r(g) = 0.65) and phenotypic (r(p) = 0.44) correlation, and were also positively correlated with grain yield and kernel weight but negatively correlated with test weight and protein content. Plant height was positively correlated with grain protein content (r(g) = 0.53; r(p) = 0.42), but negatively correlated with grain yield (r(g) = -0.47; r(p) = -0.14). Grain yield and protein content showed negative genetic correlation (r(g) = -0.57). Among the sixty cultivars from Canada Western Red Spring Class released over 100 years, the newest cultivar yielded 23 % more grain and had 15 % higher grain protein than the oldest cultivar 'Red Fife'. Breeders in western Canada have incorporated vernalization and photoperiod insensitive and Rht genes in modern cultivars to promote early maturity, to make use of off-season nurseries abroad, and to improve lodging tolerance.

AB PCR-based rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome-specific markers can contribute to the effective utilization of elite genes of rye in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs. In the present study, 578 new PCR-based rye-specific markers have been developed by using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, and 76 markers displayed different polymorphism among rye Kustro, Imperial, and King II. A total of 427 and 387 markers were, respectively, located on individual chromosomes and chromosome arms of Kustro by using a set of wheat-rye monosomic addition lines and 13 monotelosomic addition lines, which were derived from T. aestivum L. 'Mianyang11' x S. cereale L. 'Kustro'. In addition, two sets of wheat-rye disomic addition lines, which were derived from T. aestivum L. var. Chinese Spring x S. cereale L. var. Imperial and T. aestivum L. 'Holdfast' x S. cereale L. var. King II, were used to test the chromosomal specificity of the 427 markers. The chromosomal locations of 281 markers were consistent among the three sets of wheat-rye addition lines. The markers developed in this study can be used to identify a given segment of rye chromosomes in wheat background and accelerate the utilization of elite genes on rye chromosomes in wheat breeding programs.

AB A study was conducted to identify SSR markers linked to leaf rust resistance genes Lr24 and Lr28 and to be used for Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) to transfer both genes to a widely cultivated wheat variety MP 3299 under rainfed condition. F2 individuals of the cross MP 3299xNIL PBW 343 were used for generating genotypic data employing closely linked SCAR markers S73719 and S421570 to Lr24 and Lr28, respectively, and further subjected to bulk segregant analysis. A total of 70 SSR markers that amplify sequences on long arm of chromosome 3D and long arm of chromosome 4A were used for polymorphism assay between the parents MP 3299 and NIL PBW 343. Eighteen SSRs were polymorphic between the parents, of which 10 were located on chromosome 3DL and eight on chromosome 4AL. Three SSR markers out of 18 polymorphic markers differentiated two contrasting bulks and further used for F2 genotyping. Finally, one SSR marker i.e. 'barc 71' linked to SCAR marker SCS73719 at a distance of 3.36 cM based on the per cent recombination frequency was identified. Thus, the newly identified SSR marker barc 71 linked to Lr24 can serve as a useful marker in gene pyramiding instead of SCAR marker SCS73719.

AB While wheat powdery mildew occurs throughout the south-central and eastern United States, epidemics are especially damaging in the Mid-Atlantic states. The structure of the U.S. Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici population was assessed based on a sample of 238 single-spored isolates. The isolates were collected from 16 locations in 12 states (18 site-years) as chasmothecial samples in 2003 or 2005, or as conidial samples in 2007 or 2010. DNA was evaluated using nine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in four housekeeping genes, and 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The SSR markers were variably polymorphic, with allele numbers ranging from 3 to 39 per locus. Genotypic diversity was high (210 haplotypes) and in eight of the site-years, every isolate had a different SSR genotype. SNP haplotypic diversity was lower; although 15 haplotypes were identified, the majority of isolates possessed one of two haplotypes. The chasmothecial samples showed no evidence of linkage disequilibrium (P = 0.36), while the conidial samples did (P = 0.001), but the two groups had nearly identical mean levels of genetic diversity, which was moderate. There was a weakly positive relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance (R-2 = 0.25, P = 0.001), indicating modest isolation by distance. Most locations in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions clustered together genetically, while Southeast locations formed a distinct but adjacent cluster; all of these were genetically separated from Southern Plains locations and an intermediate location in Kentucky. One-way migration was detected at a rate of approximately five individuals per generation from populations west of the Appalachian Mountains to those to the east, despite the fact that the Atlantic states experience more frequent and damaging wheat mildew epidemics. Overall, the evidence argues for a large-scale mosaic of overlapping populations that re-establish themselves from local sources, rather than continental scale extinction and re-establishment, and a low rate of long-distance dispersal roughly from west to east, consistent with prevailing wind directions.

AB In rice, the TGW6 gene determines grain weight and encodes a protein with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-glucose hydrolase activity. Its homolog in wheat, TaTGW6, is considered as a candidate gene related to grain development. To amplify this gene, we designed primers based on a homologous conserved domain of the rice TGW6 gene. Sequence analysis indicated that TaTGW6 comprises only one exon, with 1656 bp in total and an open reading frame of 1035 bp. Three alleles at TaTGW6 locus detected by the primer pair TG23 were designated as TaTGW6-a, TaTGW6-b and TaTGW6-c, respectively. Compared with TaTGW6-a, TaTGW6-b had a 6-bp InDel at the position 170 downstream of initiation codon, and TaTGW6-c was a null mutant. Both TaTGW6-b and TaTGW6-c could significantly increase grain size and weight other than TaTGW6-a; however, the former two alleles showed a low frequency distribution in modern varieties. TaTGW6 was located on chromosome 4AL using a recombinant inbred line population and a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. It was linked to the SSR locus Xbarc1047 with a genetic distance of 6.62 cM and explained 15.8-21.0 % of phenotypic variation of grain weight in four environments. Association analysis using a natural population and Chinese wheat mini-core collections additionally validated the relationship of TaTGW6 with grain weight; the gene could explain 7.7-12.4 % of phenotypic variation in three environments. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that TaTGW6-b showed relatively lower expression than TaTGW6-a in immature grain at 20 and 30 days post-anthesis and in mature grain. The low expression of TaTGW6 generally associated with low IAA content, but with high grain weight. The novel functional marker, designated as TG23, can be used for marker-assisted selection to improve grain weight in wheat and also provides insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying grain weight.

AB The strong negative correlation between grain protein concentration (GPC) and grain yield (GY) in bread wheat complicates the simultaneous improvement of these traits. However, earlier studies have concluded that the deviation from this relationship (grain protein deviation or GPD) has strong genetic basis. Genotypes with positive GPD have an increased ability to uptake nitrogen (N) during the post-flowering period independently of the amount of N taken up before flowering, suggesting that genetic variability for N satiety could enable the breakage of the negative relationship. This study is based on two genotypes markedly contrasted for GPD grown under semi-hydroponic conditions differentiated for nitrate availability both before and after flowering. This allows exploration of the genetic determinants of post-flowering N uptake (PANU) by combining whole plant sampling and targeted gene expression approaches. The results highlights the correlation (r(2) = 0.81) with GPC of PANU occurring early during grain development (flowering-flowering + 250 degree-days) independently of GY. Early PANU was in turn correlated (r(2) = 0.80) to the stem-biomass increment after flowering through its effect on N sink activity. Differences in early PANU between genotypes, despite comparable N statuses at flowering, suggest that genetic differences in N satiety could be involved in the establishment of the GPC. Through its strong negative correlation with genes implied in N assimilation, root nitrate concentration appears to be a good marker for evaluating instantaneous plant N demand, and may provide valuable information on the genotypic N satiety level. This trait may help breeders to identify genotypes having high GPC independently of their GY.

AB Wheat heading date is an important agronomic trait determining maturation time and yield. A set of common wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Chinese Spring; CS)-wild emmer (T. turgidum L. subsp. dicoccoides (TDIC)) chromosome arm substitution lines (CASLs) was used to identify and allocate QTLs conferring late or early spike emergence by examining heading date. Genetic loci accelerating heading were found on TDIC chromosome arms 3AL and 7BS, while loci delaying heading were located on 4AL and 2BS. To map QTLs conferring late heading on 2BS, F-2 populations derived from two cross combinations of CASL2BS x CS and CASL3AL x CASL2BS were developed and each planted at two times, constituting four F2 mapping populations. Heading date varied continuously among individuals of these four populations, suggesting quantitative characteristics. A genetic map of 2BS, consisting of 23 SSR and one single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) marker(s), was constructed using these F-2 populations. This map spanned a genetic length of 53.2 cM with average marker density of 2.3 cM. The photoperiod-sensitivity gene Ppd-B1 was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS as a SSCP molecular marker, and was validated as tightly linked to a major QTL governing late heading of CASL2BS in all mapping populations. A significant dominance by additive effect of Ppd-B1 with the LUX gene located on 3AL was also detected. CS had more copies of Ppd-B1 than CASL2BS, implying that increased copy number could elevate the expression of Ppd-1 in CS, also increasing expression of LUX and FT genes and causing CS to have an earlier heading date than CASL2BS in long days.

AB Endosperm texture, i.e., the hardness or softness of the grain, is an important trait because it determines many end-use properties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). It is primarily controlled by the puroindoline genes (Pina and Pinb) at the Hardness (Ha) locus, mapped on the short arm of chromosome 5D. The introgression of functional Pin genes from diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L. chromosome 5A(m) into hexaploid wheat resulted in softer grains, suggesting that this translocation might be useful for soft wheat breeders. However, the translocated segment includes a large portion of the 5Am short arm and may carry detrimental genes for agronomic performance. In this study we have generated a backcross (BC) population of 210 individuals where 5A-5A(m) homeologous recombination was induced by the ph1b mutation to recover individuals with a reduced translocated segment. A map of this region was constructed using specific sequence tagged site (STS) markers for the three T monococcum Ha-related genes, the completely linked BGGP gene, three wheat ESTs (BG606847, BF474606, and BQ168958), and two microsatellite markers. Eight plants with recombination events between XBggp and the closest proximal locus BG606847 were identified. Of these, four have the desired T monococcum allele at the Ha locus. These plants carry a 6.3-cM segment of T monococcum chromatin proximal to the Ha locus. This germplasm, which will be publicly available, and the molecular markers developed in this study will be valuable tools for soft wheat breeding programs.

AB In order to characterise quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Type I and Type II resistance against Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, a population of recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross Cansas (moderately resistant)/Ritmo (susceptible) was evaluated in spray-inoculated field trials over three seasons. Map-based QTL analysis across environments revealed seven QTLs on chromosomes 1BS, 1DS, 3B, 3DL, 5BL, 7BS and 7AL (QFhs.whs-1B, QFhs.whs-1D, QFhs.whs-3B, QFhs.whs-3D, QFhs.whs-5B, QFhs.whs-7A, QFhs.whs-7B) associated with FHB resistance. They accounted for 56% of the phenotypic variance. QFhs.whs-1D primarily appeared to be involved in resistance to fungal penetration, whereas the other QTLs mainly contributed to resistance to fungal spread. FHB resistance was significantly correlated with plant height (PH) and heading date (HD). Including all single environments, corresponding overlaps of QTLs for FHB resistance and QTLs for PH/HD occurred at six loci, among them two consistently detected QTLs, QFhs.whs-5B and QFhs.whs-7A. When significant effects of PH and HD on FHB resistance were eliminated by covariance analysis, a second QTL analysis revealed possible escape mechanisms for the majority of the coincidental loci.

ID CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION; WHEAT
AB At the IPK Gatersleben a series of 85 bread wheat (T. aestivum)/goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii) introgression lines was developed recently. Based on the knowledge that chromosome 7D of this particular Ae. tauschii is a donor of resistance to septoria tritici blotch (Mycosphaerella graminicola), a sub-set of thirteen chromosome 7D introgression lines was investigated along with the susceptible recipient variety 'Chinese Spring' (CS) and the resistant donor line 'CS (Syn 7D)'. The material was inoculated with two Argentinian isolates of the pathogen (IPO 92067 and IPO 93014) at both the seedlings (two leaf) and adult (tillering) stages at two locations over 2 years (2003, 2004). The resistance was effective against both isolates and at both developmental stages, and the resistance locus maps to the centromeric region of chromosome arm 7DS. On the basis of its relationship with the microsatellite marker Xgwm44, it is likely that the gene involved is Stb5. Stb5 is therefore apparently effective against M. graminicola isolates originating from both Europe and South America.

AB Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disease caused by exposure to the protein gliadin in wheat, and related prolamins in barley and rye. The prevalence of the disease in the US is 1:133. The aim of this study was to identify non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci that predispose to CD. A genome-wide search of 405 microsatellite markers was performed on DNA samples from 160 families with a minimum of two cases of CD. Multipoint, parametric and non-parametric linkage (NPL) analyses were performed. Locations on chromosomes 1q, 3q, 6p, 6q, 7q, 9q and 10q showed linkage statistics (NPL scores or heterogeneity logarithm of the odds (HLOD) scores) of approximately 2.0 or larger. The greatest evidence for linkage outside of chromosome 6 was on 7q and 9q. An NPL score of 2.60 occurred at position 151.0 on 7q and a HLOD score of 2.47 occurred at position 144.8 on 9q under a recessive model. As expected, there was highly significant linkage to the HLA region on 6p, with NPL and HLOD scores exceeding 5.50. In conclusion, this genome-wide linkage analysis represents one of the largest such studies of CD. The most promising region is a putative locus on 7q, a region reported independently in previous genome-wide searches.

AB Two sequence-tagged site (STS) markers for the wheat yellow rust resistance (R) gene Yr5 have been derived through the identification and characterization of linked amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). The sequences of the 2 AFLP markers partially overlap with one another, but belong to discrete loci: S19M93-140 completely cosegregates with Yr5, whereas S23M41-310 maps at a distance of 0.7 cM. The DNA sequence of S23M41-310 shows significant homology with the 3' end of nucleotide-binding site (NBS) - leucine-rich repeat (LRR) - type R-genes, in particular with orthologues of the rice bacterial blight R-gene Xa-L The distinct genetic location of the 2 AFLP loci suggests that Yr5 falls within an R-gene cluster. Because neither sequence forms part of a detectable transcription product, we propose that the Yr5 R-gene cluster includes R-gene analogues and pseudogenes. A Yr5 flanking simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker has also been identified, which allows Yr5 to be effectively incorporated, along with other R-genes for yellow rust, into elite wheat genetic backgrounds, through marker-assisted selection.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the cytogenetic characteristics of Brazilian Lippia alba (Mill) N. E. Brown and Lantana camara Plum. that could be useful for future characterization of these genera. Our analyses revealed that Li. alba has 2n=30 chromosomes consisting of ten metacentric and five submetacentric pairs, while La. camara has 44 metacentric chromosomes. The large blocks of heterochromatin seen in both species suggest an apomorphic condition. Six 45S rDNA sites were detected in both species by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two and four 5S rDNA sites were observed in Li. alba and La. camara, respectively. Meiotic analysis revealed a normal chromosomal behaviour. The number of chromosomes and the presence of 45S rDNA and 5S rDNA sites do not exclude a possible polyploid origin. The cytogenetic differences between La. camara and Li. alba may be useful markers for differentiating these species.

AB The epistatic interaction of alleles at the VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 loci determines vernalization sensitivity in barley. To validate the current molecular model for the two-locus epistasis, we crossed homozygous vernalization-insensitive plants harboring a predicted "winter type" allele at either VRN-H1 (Dicktoo) or VRN-H2 (Oregon Wolfe Barley Dominant), or at both VRN-H (Calicuchima-sib) loci and measured the flowering time of unvernalized F(2) progeny under long-day photoperiod. We assessed whether the spring growth habit of Calicuchima-sib is an exception to the two-locus epistatic model or contains novel "spring" alleles at VRN-H1 (HvBM5A) and/or VRN-H2 (ZCCT-H) by determining allele sequence variants at these loci and their effects relative to growth habit. We found that (a) progeny with predicted "winter type" alleles at both VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 alleles exhibited an extremely delayed flowering (i.e. vernalization-sensitive) phenotype in two out of the three F(2) populations, (b) sequence flanking the vernalization critical region of HvBM5A intron 1 likely influences degree of vernalization sensitivity, (c) a winter habit is retained when ZCCT-Ha has been deleted, and (d) the ZCCT-H genes have higher levels of allelic polymorphism than other winterhardiness regulatory genes. Our results validate the model explaining the epistatic interaction of VRN-H2 and VRN-H1 under long-day conditions, demonstrate recovery of vernalization-sensitive progeny from crosses of vernalization-insensitive genotypes, show that intron length variation in VRN-H1 may account for a continuum of vernalization sensitivity, and provide molecular markers that are accurate predictors of "winter vs spring type" alleles at the VRN-H loci.

AB The objective of this work was to identify expressed simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers associated to leaf miner resistance in coffee progenies. Identification of SSR markers was accomplished by directed searches on the Brazilian Coffee Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database. Sequence analysis of 32 selected SSR loci showed that 65% repeats are of tetra-, 21% of tri- and 14% of dinucleotides. Also, expressed SSR are localized frequently in the 5'-UTR of gene transcript. Moreover, most of the genes containing SSR are associated with defense mechanisms. Polymorphisms were analyzed in progenies segregating for resistance to the leaf miner and corresponding to advanced generations of a Coffea arabica x Coffea racemosa hybrid. Frequency of SSR alleles was 2.1 per locus. However, no polymorphism associated with leaf miner resistance was identified. These results suggest that marker-assisted selection in coffee breeding should be performed on the initial cross, in which genetic variability is still significant.

ID RESOURCE; INFORMATION; DATABASE
AB The completion of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome draft has brought unprecedented opportunities for genomic studies of the world's most important food crop. Previous rice gene annotations have relied mainly on ab initio methods, which usually yield a high rate of false-positive predictions and give only limited information regarding alternative splicing in rice genes. Comparative approaches based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs) can compensate for the drawbacks of ab initio methods because they can simultaneously identify experimental data-supported genes and alternatively spliced transcripts. Furthermore, cross-species EST information can be used to not only offset the insufficiency of same-species ESTs but also derive evolutionary implications. In this study, we used ESTs from seven plant species, rice, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), soybean (Glycine max), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), to annotate the rice genome. We developed a plant genome annotation pipeline, Plant Gene and Alternatively Spliced Variant Annotator (PGAA). Using this approach, we identified 852 genes (931 isoforms) not annotated in other widely used databases (i.e. the Institute for Genomic Research, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and Rice Annotation Project) and found 87% of them supported by both rice and nonrice EST evidence. PGAA also identified more than 44,000 alternatively spliced events, of which approximately 20% are not observed in the other three annotations. These novel annotations represent rich opportunities for rice genome research, because the functions of most of our annotated genes are currently unknown. Also, in the PGAA annotation, the isoforms with non-rice-EST-supported exons are significantly enriched in transporter activity but significantly underrepresented in transcription regulator activity. We have also identified potential lineage-specific and conserved isoforms, which are important markers in evolutionary studies. The data and the Web-based interface, RiceViewer, are available for public access at http://RiceViewer.genomics.sinica.edu.tw/.

AB Morphogenetic processes in immature embryos of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were investigated using a molecular marker for meristematic cells of cereals (proliferative antigen of meristem initial cells, PAIC). The used genetic model comprised a series of almost isogenic lines of wheat alternative by the alleles of dwarfing genes (RhtB1c, RhtB1b, and Rht14) and the original cv. Saratovskaya 29. The Rht genetic system was found to affect the level of PAIC in the wheat callus cells during callus formation and subsequent regeneration. We found differences in the level of PAIC at certain stages of culturing and a general trend of its content in the course of callus formation and secondary differentiation in the callus tissue. Possible role of PAIC as a marker of meristematic centers within the callus tissue and the prospect of its use in breeding as an additional criterion for estimation of morphogenetic ability of the newly produced lines of wheat are discussed.

AB Dynamic management (DM) is a method of genetic resources conservation that aims at maintaining evolutionary process in subdivided populations cultivated in contrasted environments. Such populations are often submitted to strong natural selection as it was the case for experimental wheat populations maintained under DM. Understanding impacts of selection on genetic diversity around selected genes is necessary for the middle-term maintenance of genetic variability in DM populations. Evolution of diversity at six neutral markers located near the yellow rust resistance gene Yr17 has been studied for the parental lines and for generations 1, 5, 10 and 17 in one of the DM populations. Yr17 provided complete resistance to yellow rust in France until 1997 and thus was suspected to be under strong selection. The gene is located on a fragment introgressed in winter wheat from a wild species. The presence of the gene was estimated using a marker closely related to the gene. We showed that the Yr17 gene has been selected between generations 5 and 10. Generally, selection tends to reduce diversity around selected genes, generating linkage disequilibrium (LD) between a gene and adjacent markers. Here, the major effect of the Yr17 gene selection was a reduction of multilocus diversity and the maintenance of strong pre-existing LD in the zone surrounding the gene for a distance of 20 cM. As expected, the presence of the exogenous introgression was responsible for restrictions to recombination which contributed to the maintenance of strong correlations between loci. However, we found a noticeable number of recombinations around the gene indicating a progressive incorporation of the fragment into the wheat genome.

AB An integrated barley transcript map (consensus map) comprising 1,032 expressed sequence tag (EST)-based markers (total 1,055 loci: 607 RFLP, 190 SSR, and 258 SNP), and 200 anchor markers from previously published data, has been generated by mapping in three doubled haploid (DH) populations. Between 107 and 179 EST-based markers were allocated to the seven individual barley linkage groups. The map covers 1118.3 cM with individual linkage groups ranging from 130 cM (chromosome 4H) to 199 cM (chromosome 3H), yielding an average marker interval distance of 0.9 cM. 475 EST-based markers showed a syntenic organisation to known colinear linkage groups of the rice genome, providing an extended insight into the status of barley/rice genome colinearity as well as ancient genome duplications predating the divergence of rice and barley. The presented barley transcript map is a valuable resource for targeted marker saturation and identification of candidate genes at agronomically important loci. It provides new anchor points for detailed studies in comparative grass genomics and will support future attempts towards the integration of genetic and physical mapping information.

AB Genetic variation for aluminum (Al) tolerance in plants has allowed the development of cultivars that are high yielding on acidic, Al toxic soils. However, knowledge of intraspecific variation for Al tolerance control is needed in order to assess the potential for further Al tolerance improvement. Here we focused on the major sorghum Al tolerance gene, Alt (SB) , from the highly Al tolerant standard SC283 to investigate the range of genetic diversity for Al tolerance control in sorghum accessions from diverse origins. Two tightly linked STS markers flanking Alt (SB) were used to study the role of this locus in the segregation for Al tolerance in mapping populations derived from different sources of Al tolerance crossed with a common Al sensitive tester, BR012, as well as to isolate the allelic effects of Alt (SB) in near-isogenic lines. The results indicated the existence not only of multiple alleles at the Alt (SB) locus, which conditioned a wide range of tolerance levels, but also of novel sorghum Al tolerance genes. Transgressive segregation was observed in a highly Al tolerant breeding line, indicating that potential exists to exploit the additive or codominant effects of distinct Al tolerance loci. A global, SSR-based, genetic diversity analysis using a broader sorghum set revealed the presence of both multiple Alt (SB) alleles and different Al tolerance genes within highly related accessions. This suggests that efforts toward broadening the genetic basis for Al tolerance in sorghum may benefit from a detailed analysis of Al tolerance gene diversity within subgroups across a target population.

AB The tropical flower Curcuma alismatifolia of the family Zingiberaceac is widely valued as a cut flower and potted plant clue to its range of vibrant colors and large long-lasting inflorescences. Much of this diversity has been cultivated through extensive hybridization of wild varieties since hybrids often exhibit dramatic phenotypic differences from the parents. This phenotypic diversity though has led to difficulties identifying and classifying the relatedness of Curcuma varieties particularly between hybrids. One Curcuma variety called 'Patumma' is of particular importance since it has strong stalks, large symmetric inflorescences, is moderately resistant to fungal blight, has a high yield, and has been used to produce numerous high quality hybrids. Since Patumma is one of the key Curcuma varieties from which many hybrid crosses and induced mutation varieties were developed, we chose it as a target to be characterized using a molecular marker. Starting with a set of 11 unique decamer primers, polymorphic bands ranging from 100 to 2500 base pairs were used to examine 20 Curcuma varieties from which banding patterns of interest were selected for conversion to the more reproducible and robust sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. In particular, one SCAR marker amplified a region 600 bp in length which was conserved in all Patumma varieties and hybrids and as an independent test did not amplify an additional series of 24 distinct Curcuma varieties. Since new varieties of Curcuma are often dissimilar from their progenitors, this genomic analysis allows a cost-effective morphologically independent characterization of Curcuma hybrids.

AB Gibberella zeae (anamorph, Fusarium graminearum) is an important pathogen of cereal crops found in many regions of the world. In this study, we have characterized two auxotrophic strains, designated S4B1279 and S4B3008, which were discovered from a collection of insertional mutants of G. zeae generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI). Both mutant strains exhibited pleiotropic phenotypic changes that include reduction of mycelial growth and virulence and abolished sexual reproduction. Molecular analysis of the REMI mutants has shown that the auxotrophy of S4B1279 is due to a mutation of the ARG2 gene encoding an acetylglutamate synthase, and the auxotrophy of S4B3008 is due to a mutation of the ADE5 gene encoding a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase. Subsequent gene disruption and complementation studies have confirmed the functions for ARG2 and ADE5, respectively, in G. zeae. Our study has demonstrated the feasibility of using the REMI technique in studying G. zeae virulence mechanisms, in addition to providing two new selectable markers allowing genetic transformation of the fungus.

AB The maize gene b-32, normally expressed in the maize (Zea mays) endosperm, encodes for a RIP (Ribosome Inactivating Protein) characterised by antifungal activity. Transgenic wheat plants were obtained via biolistic transformation, in which the b-32 gene is driven by the 35SCaMV promoter in association with the bar gene as a selectable marker. Plants were brought to homozygosity through genetic analysis of progeny and pathogenicity tests were performed on the fourth generation. Six homozygous b-32 wheat lines were characterised. All plants had a normal phenotype, not distinguishable from the control cv. Veery except for slightly smaller size, flowered and set seeds. Western blot analyses confirmed b-32 expression during the plant life cycle in the various tissues. Each line differed in the b-32 content in leaf protein extracts and the transgenic protein expression level was maintained at least up to 10 days after anthesis. Pathogenicity tests for Fusarium head blight (FHB) were performed on the b-32 transgenic wheat lines in comparison to the parental cv. Veery. Resistance to FHB was evaluated by the single floret injection inoculation method on immature spikes with spores of Fusarium culmorum. In all the transgenic lines, a similar reduction in FHB symptoms, not dependent on the level of b-32 protein, has been observed (20% and 30% relative to the control, respectively 7 and 14 days after inoculation). Percentage of tombstone kernels at maturity was also recorded; in all transgenic lines disease control for this parameter was around 25%. The data obtained indicate that maize b-32 was effective as in vivo antifungal protein reducing FHB symptoms in wheat lines expressing the maize RIP protein.

AB Chromosomal rearrangements can be triggered by recombination between distinct but related regions. Brassica napus (AACC; 2n = 38) is recent allopolyploid species whose progenitor genomes are widely replicated. In this article, we analyze the extent to which chromosomal rearrangements originate from homeologous recombination during meiosis of haploid B. napus (n = 19) by genotyping progenies of haploid X euploid B. napus with molecular markets. Our study focuses on three pairs of homeologous re-ions selected for their differing levels of divergence (N1/N11, N3/N13, and N9/N18). We show that a high number of chromosomal rearrangements occur during meiosis of B. napus haploid and are transmitted by first division restitution (FDR)-like unreduced gametes to their progeny; half of the progeny of Darmor-bzh haploids display duplications and/or losses in the chromosomal regions being studied. We demonstrate that half of these rearrangements are due to recombination between regions of primary homeology, which represents a 10- to 100-fold increase compared to the frequency of homeologous recombination measured in euploid lines. Some of the other rearrangements certainly result from recombination between paralogous regions because we observed an average of one to two autosyndetic A-A and/or C-C bivalents at metaphase I of the B. napus haploid. These results are discussed in the context of genome evolution of B. napus.

AB Preharvest sprouting (PHS) is one of the most important factors affecting wheat production worldwide in environments characterized by rainfall and high humidity at harvest. In such environments, the incorporation of seed dormancy of a limited duration is required to minimize losses associated with PHS. A global collection of 28 PHS-resistant and -susceptible wheat germplasm was characterized with microsatellite markers flanking the genomic regions associated with PHS-resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs), particularly on chromosomes 3D and 4A. The genetic diversity analysis revealed 380 alleles at 54 microsatellite loci, with an average of 7.0 alleles per locus, among the 28 wheat genotypes. Gower's genetic similarity values among all possible pairs of genotypes varied from 0.44 to 0.97, indicating that there is considerable diversity in the PHS germplasm evaluated. Cluster and principal coordinates analysis of genetic similarity estimates differentiated the genotypes into groups, according to their source of PHS resistance. Three major SSR haplotypes were observed on chromosome 4AL, designated RL4137-type allele, Aus1408-type allele, and synthetic-hexaploid-type allele. The RL4137-type allele was prevalent in Canadian cultivars, mostly in cluster 6, followed by the Aus1408-type and its derivatives in clusters 4 and 5. The Syn36 and Syn37 alleles on chromosome 4AL were rare. On chromosome 3DL, the SSRs haplotypes derived from Syn36 and Syn37 were also rare, and proved unique to the Aegilops tauschii - derived synthetic hexaploids. They are therefore likely carrying resistance genes different from those previously reported. Based on genetic relationships, PHS resistance might be improved by selecting parental genotypes from different clusters.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for wheat resistance to aluminum (Al) toxicity were analyzed using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in a population of 192 F-6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between an Al-resistant cultivar, Atlas 66 and an Al-sensitive cultivar, Chisholm. Wheat reaction to Al was measured by relative root growth and root response to hematoxylin stain in nutrient-solution culture. After screening 1,028 SSR markers for polymorphisms between the parents and bulks, we identified two QTLs for Al resistance in Atlas 66. One major QTL was mapped on chromosome 4D that co-segregated with the Al-activated malate transporter gene (ALMT1). Another minor QTL was located on chromosome 3BL. Together, these two QTLs accounted for about 57% of the phenotypic variation in hematoxylin staining score and 50% of the variation in net root growth (NRG). Expression of the minor QTL on 3BL was suppressed by the major QTL on 4DL. The two QTLs for Al resistance in Atlas 66 were also verified in an additional RIL population derived from Atlas 66/Century. Several SSR markers closely linked to the QTLs were identified and have potential to be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to improve Al-resistance of wheat cultivars in breeding programs.

AB Previously, Mdm1, a gene controlling resistance to Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), was identified in the inbred line Pa405. The gene was tightly linked to the restriction fragment length polymorphism marker umc85 on the short arm of chromosome 6. This chromosomal region is also the location of resistance genes to two other viruses in the family Potyviridae, Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) and Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). A diverse collection of 115 maize inbred lines was evaluated for resistance to MDMV and SCMV, and for MDMV resistance loci on chromosome 6S. Forty-six resistant inbred lines were crossed to three MDMV-susceptible inbred lines to develop F-2 populations. The F-2 populations were inoculated with MDMV and scored for infection and symptom type. Environmental factors influenced both the rate and type of symptom development. Bulked segregant analysis of each F-2 population indicated that, in 42 of 43 MDMV-resistant lines, chromosome 6S markers found in the resistant parent also were present in the bulked resistant but not the susceptible tissue. Markers previously associated with resistance to both SCMV and WSMV on chromosome 3 and to WSMV on chromosome 10 were associated with resistance in nine and seven of the F-2 populations, respectively. These data suggest that Mdm1 or closely linked genes on chromosome 6S are associated with MDMV resistance in most germplasm, but that other loci also may affect resistance.

AB Brachypodium sylvaticum and Brachypodium distachyon were recently proposed as new model plants because of their small genomes and their phylogenetic position between rice and Triticeae crops. We sequenced a 371-kb region in B. sylvaticum, the largest genomic sequence available so far from this species, providing quantitative data on gene conservation, collinearity and phylogeny. We compared it with orthologous regions from rice and wheat. Brachypodium and wheat show perfect macro-collinearity of genetic markers, whereas rice contains an approximately 220-kb inversion. Rice contains almost twice as many genes as Brachypodium in the region studied, whereas wheat has about 40% more. Through comparative annotation, we identified alternative transcripts and improved the annotation for several rice genes, indicating that approximately 15% of rice genes might require re-annotation. Surprisingly, our data suggest that 10-15% of functional sequences in small grass genomes may not encode any proteins. From available genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences, we estimated Brachypodium to have diverged from wheat about 35-40 Mya, significantly more recently than the divergence of rice and wheat. However, our data also indicate that orthologous regions from Brachypodium and wheat differ considerably in gene content, thus the Brachypodium genome sequence probably cannot replace genomic studies in the large Triticeae genomes.

AB A critical step in the development of a robust Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for a recalcitrant species, like barley, is the establishment of optimal conditions for efficient T-DNA delivery into target tissue from which plants can be regenerated. We used Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 harbouring either binary vector pUGAB7, which contains a T-DNA incorporating the bar gene and uidA gene, or pYF133, which contains hpt gene and gfp gene. These were used to investigate and optimize major T-DNA delivery and tissue culture variables in the immature embryos of barley (cv. Golden Promise). A number of factors produced significant difference in T-DNA delivery. These included preculture of immature embryos, co-cultivation, presence of acetosyringone and sonication and vacuum filtration assisted inoculation of 1-day precultured immature embryos. Plant regeneration was achieved via somatic embryogenesis. Regeneration media showed significant difference in their capacity to support regeneration of transgenic plants. Optimizing factors for T-DNA delivery resulted in bialaphos and hygromycin resistant barley transgenic plants with transformation efficiencies ranging from 2.6 to 5.6% and 3.3 to 6.7%, respectively. Molecular analysis of transgenic plants demonstrated that transgenes were integrated into the barley genome and subsequently transmitted into progeny at Mendelian ratios. The developed protocol will facilitate the insertion of desirable traits into barley via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most important fungal wheat diseases worldwide. Understanding the genetics of FHB resistance is key to facilitate the introgression of different FHB resistance genes into adapted wheat. The objective of this project was to study the FHB resistance QTL on chromosome 6B, quantify the phenotypic variation, and qualitatively map the resistance gene as a Mendelian factor. The FHB resistant parent BW278 (AC Domain*2/Sumai 3) was used as the source of the resistance allele. A large recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population was developed from the cross BW278/AC Foremost. The population segregated for three known FHB resistance QTL located on chromosomes 3BSc, 5A, and 6B. Molecular markers on chromosome 6B (WMC104, WMC397, GWM219), 5A (GWM154, GWM304, WMC415), and 3BS (WMC78, GWM566, WMC527) were amplified on approximately 1,440 F-2:7 RILs. The marker information was used to select 89 RILs that were fixed homozygous susceptible for the 3BSc and 5A FHB QTLs and were recombinant in the 6B interval. Disease response was evaluated on 89 RILs and parental checks in the greenhouse and field nurseries. Dual floret injection (DFI) was used in greenhouse trials to evaluate disease severity (DS). Macroconidial spray inoculations were used in field nurseries conducted at two locations in southern Manitoba (Carman and Glenlea) over two years 2003 and 2004, to evaluate disease incidence, disease severity, visual rating index, and Fusarium-damaged kernels. The phenotypic distribution for all five-disease infection measurements was bimodal, with lines resembling either the resistant or susceptible checks and parents. All of the four field traits for FHB resistance mapped qualitatively to a coincident position on chromosome 6BS, flanked by GWM133 and GWM644, and is named Fhb2. The greenhouse-DS trait mapped 2 cM distal to Fhb2. Qualitative mapping of Fhb2 in wheat provides tightly linked markers that can reduce linkage drag associated with marker assisted selection of Fhb2 and aid the pyramiding of different resistance loci for wheat improvement.

AB Earliness is one of the most important adaptation traits in plant breeding. Our purpose was to identify the genome regions of bread wheat involved in the control of earliness and its three components: photoperiod sensitivity (PS), vernalization requirement (VR) and intrinsic earliness (IE). A QTL meta-analysis was carried out to examine the replicability of QTL across 13 independent studies and to propose meta-QTL (MQTL). Initial QTL were projected on a recent consensus map (2004). Quality criteria were proposed to assess the reliability of this projection. These criteria were based on the distances between markers in the QTL regions. Chromosomes of groups 2 and 5 had a greater incidence on earliness control as they carry the known, major genes Ppd and Vrn. Other chromosome regions played an intermediate role in earliness control: 4A [heading date (HD) Meta-QTL], 4B (HD MQTL), 2B (VR MQTL) and 5B (IE MQTL). Markers at this four MQTL should prove helpful in marker-assisted selection, to better control earliness.

AB RFLP analysis of mitochondrial DNA was carried out with eight restriction enzymes BamHI, EcoRI, HaeIII, HindIII, MspI, PstI, SalI and XhoI, from which nine mitochondrial gene probes (atp6, atp9, atpl, cox], nad3, nad6, nad9, pol-r, orf25) were hybridized, by means of digestion products, for seven species of the genus Secale. RFLP EcoRI/pol-r specific markers were determined for all the species of rye. To estimate the relationships among species, genetic pairwise similarities between them were estimated and a UPGMA dendrogram was constructed. The analysis separated the species into two groups. The first comprises the pair Secale sylvestre Host and S. cereale subsp. segetale Zhuk., exhibiting the greatest genetic similarity, that is, closest relationships. The second group is composed of S. strictum/Presl/Presl, S. strictum/Presl/Presl subsp. kuprijanovii/Grossh./ Hammer, S. strictum/Presl/Presl subsp. africanum/Stapf/Hammer, Secale cereale L. and S. vavilovii Grossh., with one clear subgroup comprising Secale strictum/Presl/Presl and S. strictum/Presl/Presl subsp. kuprijanovii Grossh./Hammer. The latter two species showed the highest genetic similarity to each other and relatively high genetic similarity to the remaining species in the group.

AB To obtain accurate estimates of population structure for purposes of conservation planning for wild lotus (Nehunbo nucifera Gaertn.) in central China, genetic diversity among and within six populations, and clonal diversity within another two populations of the species were analyzed. The genetic diversity was high (percentage of polymorphic bands, PPB = 90.0%; Shannon's information index, I = 0.383 +/- 0.234) at the species level, but low within individual study populations (PPB = 35.8%; Shannon's information index I = 0.165 +/- 0.241). The mean coefficient of gene differentiation (G(st)) was 0.570, indicating that 43.0% of the genetic diversity resided within the population. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 50.47% of the genetic diversity among the study populations was attributed to geographical location while 12.3% was attributed to differences in their habitats. An overall value of mean estimated number of gene flow (N-m = 0.377) indicated that there was limited gene flow among the sampled populations. The level of clonal diversity found within the populations was considerably high (Simpson's diversity index, D = 0.985) indicating that clonal diversity contributes to a major extent to the overall genetic variation in the genetic structure of N. nucifera. On the basis of the high G(st) and D values detected in this study we recommend that any future conservation plans for this species should be specifically designed to include those representative populations with the highest genetic variation for both in situ conservation and germplasm collection expeditions.

AB Disease resistance (R) genes have been isolated from many plant species and R genes with domains of nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRR) represent the largest R gene family. The objective of this investigation was to test a resistance gene analog (RGA) anchored marker system, called amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-RGA in cotton (Gossypium spp.). The AFLP-RGA analysis uses one degenerate RGA primer designed from various NBS and LRR domains of R genes in combination with one selective AFLP primer in a PCR reaction. Out of a total of 446 AFLP-RGA bands amplified by 22 AFLP-RGA primer combinations, 76 (17.0%) and 37 (8.3%) were polymorphic within four G. hirsutum L. genotypes and four G. barbadense L. cotton genotypes, respectively. The number of polymorphic AFLP-RGA bands (256) between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense was much higher (57.4%). This level of polymorphism mirrors that of AFLP. The genetic similarity among the eight genotypes based on AFLP-RGA or AFLP lead to similar results in genotype grouping at the species and intraspecies level. However, RGA markers amplified by only degenerate RGA primers could not discriminate several genotypes. AFLP-RGA offers a great flexibility for numerous primer combinations in a genome-wide search for RGAs. Due to the distribution of RGAs or RGA clusters in the plant genome, genome-wide AFLP-RGA analysis provides a useful resource for candidate gene mapping of R genes for disease resistance in cotton.

ID HEXAPLOID WHEAT; PROTEIN-CONTENT; AESTIVUM; WEIGHT
AB The hexaploid wheat species Triticum aestivum L. ssp compactum var. amplissifolium Zhuk. produces small plump but curved or boat shaped kernels with low thousand kernel weight. The grain number per unit spike length is high. The trait curved grain seems to be rare. The genetic analysis in F-2 (T aestivum cv. NI5439 X T amplissifolium), BC1 (F-1 X N15439) and F-3 generations revealed that the curved grain is governed by a single dominant gene. The gene symbol Cvg is proposed for this trait. The curved nature of the grain could serve as a useful morphological marker. The characters short spike and kernel color are also controlled by a single but independent gene. The number of grains per unit spike length and 1000 kernel weight are presumably governed by more than one gene and both the traits showed some association with the character short spike. The linkage analysis indicated that the character curved grain is linked with short spike length and the distance between these characters is 7.63 Kosambi unit.

AB Knowledge of changes associated with advances in crop productivity is essential for understanding yield limiting factors and developing strategies for future genetic improvement. The objectives of this study are to understand genetic gain for grain yield and associated traits in the Northern China Winter Wheat Region (NCWWR). Four trials, comprised of 47 leading common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars from the NCWWR from 1960 to 2000, were conducted during 2001 to 2003 using a completely randomized block design of three replicates under controlled field environments. Molecular markers were used to detect the presence of dwarfing genes and the 1B/1R translocation. Results showed that average annual genetic gain in grain yield ranged from 32.07 to 72.11 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) or from 0.48 to 1.23% annually in different provinces. The most significant increase in grain yield occurred in the early 1980s, largely because of the successful utilization of dwarfing genes and the 1B/1R translocation. There was no common trend across trials in terms of changes in spikes m(-2), kernels per spike, 1000-kernel weight (TKW), or biomass. The genetic improvement in grain yield was primarily attributed to increased grain weight per spike, reduced plant height, and increased harvest index (HI). The dwarfing allele Rht-D1b was the most frequent (68.0%) among the cultivars, followed by Rht 8 (42.0%) and Rht-B1b (16.0%). The frequency of 1B/1R translocation cultivars was 42.6%. The future challenge of wheat breeding in this region is to maintain the genetic gain in grain yield and to improve grain quality, without increasing inputs for the wheat-maize double cropping system.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-Rye (Secale cereale L.) T2BS.2RL translocations were shown to increase grain yield, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and had minor effects on baking quality. The objective of this study was to test agronomic performance and resistance of a new wheat-rye translocation (T2BS.2RL, SLU) to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis E sp. tritici (DC.) E. O. Speer), leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.), stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. & Henn.), stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici Westend.) and Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)]. F-2 derived F-4-F-6 T2BS.2RL lines, non-translocation lines, and the wheat cultivar Holme were compared using intact seedlings or leaf segments. T2BS.2RL conferred seedling resistance to 17 powdery mildew isolates, 14 leaf rust and one stem rust pathotype. The T2BS.2RL lines were susceptible to 3 stripe rust pathotypes as seedlings, while showing adult plant resistance under natural conditions. Agronomic characters were compared in a 2-yr hill-plot field trial in Sweden. T2BS.2RL lines flowered 2 to 3 d later and had an increased number of spikelets per spike. The T2BS.2RL had no significant effect on yield, straw length, lodging, volume weight, 1000-kernel weight, fertility, alpha-amylase activity, or starch or protein content. The multiple disease resistance and the minor negative effects on agronomic performance of the T2BS.2RL, SLU translocation encourage its use in wheat breeding.

AB The objective of this study was to assess whether modern plant breeding has led to any loss of genetic diversity in modern European winter wheat varieties (Triticum aestivum L.). For this purpose, a collection of 511 widely grown winter wheat varieties of Central and Northern Europe was genotyped with 42 microsatellite markers. In the varieties representing the National List of the UK during the 1980s and 1990s the allelic richness and gene diversity were lower than in the varieties of Recommended Lists covering the time period 1945-2000. However, no apparent quantitative loss of genetic diversity was found by comparing the different decadal groups of varieties present in the Recommended Lists. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the variance component among varieties within decadal groups accounted for 96.41% of the genetic variation, but among decadal groups only for 3.59%. The Fst values increased from the 1950s to the 1990s compared to the 1940s with a slight decrease in the 1970s. These results suggested that modern plant breeding has resulted in changes of alleles present in the germplasm; however, it appears that modern plant breeding has resulted in no apparent loss of allele numbers, or genetic diversity, in the investigated European wheat varieties over time.

AB Six hundred and seventy two loci belonging to 275 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats [EST-SSRs, including 93 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 182 rye (Secale cereale L.) EST-SSRs] were physically mapped on 21 wheat chromosomes. The mopping involved two approaches, the wet-lob approach involving use of deletion stocks and the in silico approach involving matching with ESTs that were previously mapped. The number of loci per EST-SSR mopped using the in silica approach was almost double the number of loci mapped using the wet-lab approach (using deletion stocks). The distribution of loci on the three subgenomes, on the seven homoeologous groups and on the 21 individual chromosomes was nonrandom (P << 0.01). Long arms had disproportionately (relative to the difference in DNA content) higher number of loci, with more loci mopped to the distal regions of chromosome arms. A fairly high proportion of EST-SSRs had multiple loci, which were largely (81%) homoeoloci. Rye EST-SSRs showed a high level of transferability (approximate to 77%) to the wheat genome. Putative functions were assigned to 216 SSR-containing ESTs through homology searches against the protein database. As many as 104 SSR-containing ESTs (a subset of the above ESTs) were also mapped to the 12 rice chromosomes, which corresponded with the known homology between wheat and rice chromosomes. These physical maps of EST-SSRs should prove useful for comparative genomics, gene tagging, fine mapping, and cloning of genes and QTLs.

AB Recently a major gene determining non-specific adult plant disease resistance against stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) designated Yrns-B1 was mapped in wheat Triticum aestivum L. by using a cross between 'Lgst. 79-74' (resistant) and 'Winzi' (susceptible). Linkage to five Gatersleben wheat microsatellite (GWM) markers was discovered, previously mapped on chromosome arm 3BS. In the present study this map was improved by the incorporation of four additional GWM markers. QTL-analysis revealed high LOD values for the resistance at all nine loci, whereas the largest LOD (20.76) was found for the newly mapped marker Xgwm1329.
   Microsatellite analysis and resistance tests of a collection of old German/UK wheat varieties, including probable ancestors of 'Lgst.79-74' were carried out. A high coincidence of non-specific adult plant disease resistance against stripe rust and the presence of 'Lgst.79-74' allele (117 bp) of the marker Xgwm533 was observed among the varieties tested. Linkage during the inheritance of both the resistance and the 117 bp allele of Xgwm533 was demonstrated. The probable origin of Yrns-B1 is discussed. Carriers of this resistance gene were grown on large areas since more than 100 years. To estimate the capability of Xgwm533 as a diagnostic marker for non-specific adult plant disease resistance against stripe rust, microsatellite analysis and resistance tests of a collection of Russian spring wheat varieties were performed. The 117 bp allele of Xgwm533 was found in about 35% of the Russian cultivars analysed, however, none of them possessed the expected disease resistance. Thus, the utilisation of Xgwm533 as diagnostic marker seems to be restricted to certain genepools.

AB Low-temperature (LT) tolerance is an important economic trait in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that determines the plants' ability to cope with below freezing temperatures. Essential elements of the LT tolerance mechanism are associated with the winter growth habit controlled by the vernalization loci (Vrn-1) on the group 5 chromosomes. To identify genomic regions, which in addition to vrn-1 determine the level of LT tolerance in hexaploid wheat, two doubled haploid (DH) mapping populations were produced using parents with winter growth habit (vrn-A1, vrn-B1, and vrn-D1) but showing different LT tolerance levels. A total of 107 DH lines were analyzed by genetic mapping to produce a consensus map of 2,873 cM. The LT tolerance levels for the Norstar (LT50=-20.7 degrees C) x Winter Manitou (LT50=-14.3 degrees C) mapping population ranged from -12.0 to -22.0 degrees C. Single marker analysis and interval mapping of phenotyped lines revealed a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 5A and a weaker QTL on chromosome ID. The 5A QTL located 46 cM proximal to the vrn-A1 locus explained 40% of the LT tolerance variance. Two C-repeat Binding Factor (CBF) genes expressed during cold acclimation in Norstar were located at the peak of the 5A QTL.

AB The family Poaceae includes over 10,000 species, among which are the most economically important cereals: maize, sorghum, rice, wheat, rye, barley, and oat. These cereals are very important components of human and animal food. Although divergence of the members of this family occurred about 40 million years ago, comparative genome analyses demonstrated that gene orders among species of this family remain largely conserved, which can be very useful for understanding their roles. and evolution. Even with an intricate evolutionary history in which chromosome fragments, losses and duplications have to be considered at the ploidy level, grasses present a genetic model system for comparative genomics. The availability of mapped molecular markers, rice genome sequences and BAC and EST libraries from several grass species, such as rice, wheat, sorghum, and maize, facilitates biology and phylogeny studies of this group. The value of using information from different species in modem plant genetics is unquestionable, especially in the study of traits such as tolerance to aluminum in soils, which affects plant growth and development. Comparative genomic approaches to aluminum tolerance can identify genomic regions and genes responsible for aluminum tolerance in grasses.

AB This paper describes a series of winter wheat - winter barley disomic addition lines developed from hybrids between winter wheat line Triticum aestivum L. 'Martonvasari 9 krl' and the German 2-rowed winter barley cultivar Hordeum vulgare L. 'Igri'. The barley chromosomes in a wheat background were identified from the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) patterns obtained with various combinations of repetitive DNA probes: GAA-HvT01 and pTa71-HvT01. The disomic addition lines 2H, 3H, and 4H and the IHS isochromosome were identified on the basis of a 2-colour FISH with the DNA probe pairs GAA-pAs1, GAA-HvT01, and pTa71-HvT01. Genomic in situ hybridization was used to confirm the presence of the barley chromosomes in the wheat genome. The identification of the barley chromosomes in the addition lines was further confirmed with simple-sequence repeat markers. The addition lines were also characterized morphologically.

AB A new genetic map of rye, developed by using the 541 x Ot1-3 F-2 intercross, consists of 148 marker loci, including 99 RAPDs, 18 SSRs, 14 STSs, 9 SCARs and 7 ISSRs, and spans the distance of 1401.4 W. To the 7 rye chromosomes, 8 linkage groups were assigned and compared with the reference map of the DS2 x RXL10 F2 intercross by using 24 common markers. The 2 combined maps contain altogether 611 marker loci (70-109 per chromosome) and constitute a substantial source of information useful for further genomic studies in rye. From 21 to 37 RAPD marker loci are distributed randomly along each chromosome length and their total number for all 7 rye chromosomes is 177. This abundance of RAPD marker loci in the rye genetic map can be exploited for development of SCARs in regions containing important genes or QTL.

AB Seventy-two Xinjiang Triticum and Triticum polonicum accessions were subjected to AFLP analyses to discuss the origin of Triticum petropavlovskyi. A total of 91 putative loci were produced by four primer combinations. Among them 56 loci were polymorphic, which is equivalent to 61.53 % of the total number of putative loci. Genetic diversity among 11 T. pefropavlovskyi accessions was narrow due to the lowest number (32) of polymorphic loci among the wheat species. Forty four polymorphic loci were found in T. aestivum and T. compactum, whereas the highest polymorphism was observed in T. polonicum. On the basis of the UPGMA clustering and PCO grouping and genetic similarity estimates from the AFLPs, we noted that T. pelropavlovskyi was more closely related to the Chinese accessions of T. polonicum than to T. polonicum from other countries. Two accessions of T. aestivum were grouped with T. pelropavlovskyi in the UPGMA clustering. Both of them were similar to T. petropavlovskyi in respect of spike structure, i.e. the presence of awn, glume awn and also the presence of leaf pubescence. Six loci, which were commonly absent in Chinese T. polonicum, were also absent in almost all of the T. petropavlovskyi accessions. Findings of this study reduced the probability of an independent allopolyploidization event in the origin of T. petropavlovskyi and indicated a greater degree of gene flow between T. aestivum and T. polonicum leading to T. petropavlovskyi. It is most likely that the P-gene of T. petropavlovskyi hexaploid wheat was introduced from T. polonicum to T. aestivum via a spontaneous introgression or breeding effort.

AB Molecular markers were used to identify the allele/gene composition of complex loci Glu-A1 and Glu-B1 of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits in triticale cultivars. Forty-six Polish cultivars of both winter and spring triticale were analysed with 7 PCR-based markers. Amplified DNA fragments of HMW glutenin Glu-1 genes were separated by agarose slab-gel electrophoresis. Differences between all 3 alleles at the locus Glu-A1 [Glu-A1a (encoding Ax1), 1b (Ax2*), and 1c (AxNull)], 4 alleles at Glu-B1-1 [Glu-B1-1a (Bx7), 1b (Bx7*), 1d(Bx6), 1ac (Bx6.8)], and 5 alleles at Glu-B1-2 [Glu-B1-2a (By8), 2b (By9), 2o (By8*), 2s (By18*), and 2z (By20*)] were revealed. In total, 16 allele combinations were observed. Molecular markers are particularly helpful in distinguishing the wheat Glu-A1a and Glu-A1b alleles from the rye Glu-R1a and Glu-R1b alleles in triticale genotypes, respectively, as well as subunits Bx7 from Bx7* and By8 from By8*, which could not be distinguished by SDS-PAGE. Novel glutenin subunits By18* and By20* (unique to triticale) were identified. HMW glutenin subunit combinations of Polish triticale cultivars, earlier identified by SDS-PAGE analyses, were verified by PCR-based DNA markers. Rapid identification of wheat Glu-1 alleles by molecular markers can be an efficient alternative to the standard separation procedure for early selection of useful triticale genotypes with good bread-making quality.

AB From 2001 to 2003, leaf rust was collected in different regions of Germany and the Russian Federation to generate single spore isolates and to study the structure of the pathogen populations by analyses of virulence. The virulence of isolates was tested with 38 near-isogenic lines each carrying a different resistance gene. The analyses of variance revealed significant effects for the frequency of virulent isolates, the regions and most interactions with years and regions, but no significance was found for the effects of years. In Germany, an increase of virulence frequencies was detected for Lr1 and Lr2a while a decrease was found for Lr3a, Lr3bg and Lr3ka. Such clear trends did not occur in Russia which may be due to the great agroclimatic differences between regions. The variance of the frequency of virulent isolates was used to estimate adequate sample sizes for the analysis of regional populations of leaf rust. This procedure resulted in more reliable information about the dynamic processes within the pathogen populations. In 2002 and 2003, all pathotypes in Germany had a combined virulence to Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2b, Lr15, Lr17 and Lr20 supplemented by a few other genes. The complexity of virulence was lower in the most frequent pathotypes. In Russia virulence to the alleles at locus Lr3 was very common. Using detached leaf segments in Germany and Russia it turned out that the most virulent pathotypes carry 34 and 32 virulence genes, respectively. Virulence to Lr9, Lr19, Lr24 and Lr38 was rare or even absent. The use of major genes, not overcome by corresponding virulent pathotypes, may contribute to more durable types of resistance in case they are combined with genes having different effects, e.g. adult plant resistance.

AB Proteomic analysis offers a new approach to identify a broad spectrum of genes that are expressed in living systems. We applied a proteomic approach to study changes in wheat grain in response to drought, a major environmental parameter adversely affecting development and crop yield. Three wheat genotypes differing in genetic background were cultivated in field under well-watered and drought conditions by following a randomized complete block design with four replications. The overall effect of drought was highly significant as determined by grain yield and total dry matter. About 650 spots were reproducibly detected and analyzed on 2-DE gels. Of these, 121 proteins showed significant change under drought condition in at least one of the genotypes. Mass spectrometry analysis using MALDI-TOF/TOF led to the identification of 57 proteins. Two-thirds of identified proteins were thioredoxin (Trx) targets, in accordance with the link between drought and oxidative stress. Further, because of contrasting changes in the tolerant and susceptible genotypes studied, several proteins emerge as key participants in the drought response. In addition to providing new information on the response to water deprivation, the present study offers opportunities to pursue the breeding of wheat with enhanced drought tolerance using identified candidate genetic markers. The 2-DE database of wheat seed proteins is available for public access at http://www.proteome.ir.

AB Two BAC libraries were constructed for the forage and turf grass species Lolium perenne L. The libraries consisted of 98,304 and 101,376 BAC clones for L. perenne genotypes LTS18 and NV#20F1-30, respectively. The estimated average insert size of both libraries was approximately 100 Kb and L. perenne has a published haploid genome size of 2,034 Mb. Taken together, the two libraries represent almost 10 genome equivalents, so that there is a very high probability of any specific sequence being represented. BAC DNA was isolated and pooled to enable PCR-based screening of both libraries. In addition, BAC clones from the LTS18 genotype were replicated onto filters to enable hybridisation-based screening. To validate the libraries, primers were designed to 20 genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, disease resistance candidate genes and laccases. These primers were used to screen both libraries to verify the genome coverage and to enable the identification of full-length gene and promoter sequences for subsequent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses. These sequences will enable studies of gene function and regulation as well as the identification of efficient genetic markers for plant breeders to improve disease resistance and forage quality.

AB The soybean aphid [Aphis glycines Matsumura] is an important pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in North America. Single dominant genes in the cultivars 'Dowling' and 'Jackson' control resistance to the soybean aphid. The gene in Dowling was named Rag1, and the genetic relationship between Rag1 and the gene in Jackson is not known. The objectives of this study were to map the locations of Rag1 and the Jackson gene onto the soybean genetic map. Segregation of aphid resistance and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in F (2:3) populations developed from crosses between Dowling and the two susceptible soybean cultivars 'Loda' and 'Williams 82', and between Jackson and Loda, were analyzed. Both Rag1 and the Jackson gene segregated 1:2:1 in the F (2:3) populations and mapped to soybean linkage group M between the markers Satt435 and Satt463. Rag1 mapped 4.2 cM from Satt435 and 7.9 cM from Satt463. The Jackson gene mapped 2.1 cM from Satt435 and 8.2 cM from Satt463. Further tests to determine genetic allelism between Rag1 and the Jackson gene are in progress. The SSR markers flanking these resistance genes are being used in marker-assisted selection for aphid resistance in soybean breeding programs.

AB Among cereal crops, rye is one of the most tolerant species to aluminum. A candidate gene approach was used to determine the likely molecular identity of an Al tolerance locus (Alt4). Using PCR primers designed from a wheat aluminum tolerance gene encoding an aluminum-activated malate transporter (TaALMT1), a rye gene (ScALMT1) was amplified, cloned and sequenced. Subsequently, the ScALMT1 gene of rye was found to be located on 7RS by PCR amplification using the wheat-rye addition lines. SNP polymorphisms for this gene were detected among the parents of three F-2 populations that segregate for the Alt4 locus. A map of the rye chromosome 7R, including the Alt4 locus ScALMT1 and several molecular markers, was constructed showing a complete co-segregation between Alt4 and ScALMT1. Furthermore, expression experiments were carried out to clarify the function of this candidate gene. Briefly, the ScALMT1 gene was found to be primarily expressed in the root apex and upregulated when aluminum was present in the medium. Five-fold differences in the expression were found between the Al tolerant and the Al non-tolerant genotypes. Additionally, much higher expression was detected in the rye genotypes than the moderately tolerant "Chinese Spring" wheat cultivar. These results suggest that the Alt4 locus encodes an aluminum-activated organic acid transporter gene that could be utilized to increase Al tolerance in Al sensitive plant species. Finally, TaALMT1 homologous sequences were identified in different grasses and in the dicotyledonous plant Phaseolus vulgaris. Our data support the hypothesis of the existence of a common mechanism of Al tolerance encoded by a gene located in the homoeologous group four of cereals.

AB Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits in cereal crops because tiller number per plant determines the number of spikes or panicles per plant, a key component of grain yield and/or biomass. In order to characterize the underlying genetic variation for tillering, we have isolated mutants that are compromised in tillering ability using ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-based mutagenesis in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum subsp. monococcum). The tillering mutant, tiller inhibition (tin3) produces only one main culm compared to the wild type with many tillers. The monoculm phenotype of tin3 is due to a single recessive mutation. Genetic and molecular mapping in an F-2 population of diploid wheat located the tin3 gene on the long arm of chromosome 3A(m). One codominant RFLP marker Xpsr1205 cosegregated with tin3 in the F-2 population. Physical mapping of PSR1205 in a set of Chinese Spring deletion lines of group-3 chromosomes placed the tin3 gene in the distal 10% of the long arm of chromosome 3A, which is a recombination-rich region in wheat. The implications of the mapping of tin3 on chromosome arm 3A(m) are discussed with respect to putative orthologs of tin3 in the 3L colinear regions across various cereal genomes and other tillering traits in grasses.

AB Powdery mildew is a severe foliar disease for wheat and could cause great yield loss in epidemic years. To explore new powdery mildew resistance genes, two einkorn accessions including TA2033 and M80, both resistant to this disease, were studied for the inheritance of resistance. Each accession possessed a single but different dominant resistance gene that was designated as Mlm2033 and Mlm80, respectively. Marker mapping indicated that they are both linked to Xgwm344 on the long arm of chromosome 7A. To establish their genetic relationship with Pm1 on 7AL, five RFLP markers previously reported to co-segregate with Pm1a were converted to STS markers. Three of them detected polymorphism between the mapping parents and were mapped close to Mlm2033 or Mlm80 or both. Xmag2185, the locus determined by the STS marker derived from PSR680, one of the RFLP markers, was placed less than 2 cM away from them. The allelism test indicated that Mlm2033 and Mlm80 are likely allelic to each other. In addition, through comparative and EST mapping, more markers linked to these two genes were identified. The high density mapping of Mlm2033 and Mlm80 will contribute to map-based cloning of the Pm1 locus. The markers for both genes will also facilitate their transfer to wheat.

AB Genic microsatellites or EST-SSRs derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are desired because these are inexpensive to develop, represent transcribed genes, and often a putative function can be assigned to them. In this study we investigated 2,553 coffee ESTs (461 from the public domain and 2,092 in-house generated ESTs) for identification and development of genic microsatellite markers. Of these, 2,458 ESTs (all > 100 bp in size) were searched for SSRs using MISA-search module followed by stackPACK clustering that revealed a total of 425 microsatellites in 331 (13.5%) non-redundant ESTs/consensus sequences suggesting an approximate frequency of 1 SSR/2.16 kb of the analysed coffee transcriptome. Identified microsatellites mainly comprised of di-/tri-nucleotide repeats, of which repeat motifs AG and AAG were the most abundant. A total of 224 primer pairs could be designed from the non-redundant SSR-positive ESTs (excluding those with only mononucleotide repeats) for possible use as potential genic markers. Of this set, a total of 24 (10%) primer pairs were tested and 18 could be validated as usable markers. Sixteen of these markers revealed moderate to high polymorphism information content (PIC) across 23 genotypes of C. arabica and C. canephora, while 2 markers were found to be monomorphic. All the markers also showed robust cross-species amplifications across 14 Coffea and 4 Psilanthus species. The apparent broad cross-species/genera transferability was further confirmed by cloning and sequencing of the amplified alleles. Thus, the study provides an insight about the frequency and distribution of SSRs in coffee transcriptome, and also demonstrates the successful development of genic-SSRs. It is expected that the potential markers described here would add to the repertoire of DNA markers needed for genetic studies in cultivated coffee and also related taxa that constitute the important secondary genepool for coffee improvement.

AB The practical application of pyramiding resistance genes by the use of molecular markers was investigated in a F1 progeny derived from the cross of VHR 3082-1-42 x 'Regent'. VHR 3082-1-42 is a cross between Museadinia rotundifolia x Vitis vinifera, backcrossed another four times with V. vinifera (PAUQUET et al. 2001). It carries the Run1-gene which causes resistance to powdery mildew and the Rpv1-gene which is related to resistance against downy mildew. Both genes were introduced from Muscadinia rotundifolia (Bou-QUET et al. 2000; Wiedemann-Merdinoglu et aL 2006). 'Regent' is a new cultivar with quantitative resistance against downy and powdery mildew (Eibach and Topfer 2003) released in Germany in 1996 for commercial use. 119 individuals of the F1 progeny were screened with a molecular marker for the Run1-gene (DONALD et aL 2002), with two SSR-markers for the Rpv1-gene (Wiedeniann-Merdinoglu et al. 2006) and with several markers from 'Regent'that showed good correlation to powdery and downy mildew resistance (Zyprian et aL 2002, Salakhutdinov et al. 2003, Akkurt 2004, Fischer et aL 2004, Akkurt et aL 2007). Phenotypic evaluation for downy mildew resistance was done by artificial inoculation of leaf discs, and for powdery mildew by natural infection in a greenhouse. Comparison of the phenotypie data with the results of the molecular marker analyses showed a clear correlation between the degree of resistance and the presence of the resistance related alleles. According to the phenotypic data, 20 genotypes of the offspring were free of powdery and downy mildew infections. Based on a marker-assisted evaluation, out of these 20 genotypes a subset of four carried all the resistance related alleles for powdery and downy mildew indicating that resistance genes from both parents were effectively combined.

AB The identification of molecular markers and marker-aided selection are essential to the efficient breeding of drought-tolerant plants. However, because that characteristic is controlled by many quantitative trait loci, such markers that can screen and trace desirable barley genotypes in a segregating population or germplasm have not yet been determined. Relative water content has been used to estimate drought tolerance in plants because it is highly correlated with the drought index of yield. To develop reliable gene-specific markers for identifying tolerant versus susceptible genotypes, we performed suppression subtractive hybridization to identify candidate genes. We used two domestic barley cultivars, one having the highest RWC (drought-tolerant 'Chalbori') and the other having the lowest (drought-susceptible 'Daebaekbori'). In response to dehydration at the early seedling stage, rapid upregulation of Dehydrin3 (Dhn3) and Dhn4 occurred in the drought-tolerant genotypes, but not in the susceptible ones. Similar results were obtained with mature plants growing under frequent drought stress in the greenhouse. In addition, Dhn3 and Dhn4 conferred higher drought tolerance when they were over-expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis. Thus, in addition to using assessments of RWC, we propose that Dhn3 and Dhn4 expressions can serve as drought-induced gene-specific markers to determine drought-tolerant barley genotypes at the seedling stage.

AB A set of 104 wheat recombinant inbred lines (RILs) obtained from a cross between parents resistant (HD 29) and susceptible (WH 542) to karnal bunt (KB) (caused by Neovossia indica) were screened and used to identify random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked with resistance to karnal bunt as these would allow indirect marker assisted selection of KB resistant genotypes. The two parents were analysed with 92 RAPD primers. A total of 65 primers proved functional by giving scorable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Of these, 21 (32 %) primers detected polymorphism between the two parental genotypes. Using these primers, bulked segregant analysis was carried out on two bulk DNAs, one obtained by pooling DNA from 10 KB resistant RILs and the other similarly derived by pooling 10 KB susceptible RILs. One marker, OPM-20 showed apparent association with resistance to KB. This was confirmed following selective genotyping of individual RILs included in the bulks.

AB The production and isolation of a wheat Aegilops geniculata disomic addition line and of monosomic substitution line resistant to powdery mildew at the seedling and adult plant stages are described. Cytological analysis revealed the presence of an acrocentric chromosome in the resistant derivatives. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis indicated differences in the beta-zone of the reduced by mercaptoethanol treatment seed protein pattern between the wheat parent cv. Trakya and the resistant derivatives. A component with a high staining intensity in the beta-zone was assumed to be a marker for the chromosome 6 of Ae. geniculata. The isoenzyme activity at the Got-1 and Est-4 loci of the lines was lower than that of wheat. By analyzing the isoenzymes of the Amp-1 locus of the addition plants, a quantitative marker of Ae. geniculata 6U chromosome was identified. The progeny of the plants with the 2n=43 and 2n=42 chromosomes carrying the chromosome 6U added or mono-substituted for the wheat 6D chromosome segregated for powdery mildew resistance. The mono-and/or double conditions for this chromosome could be maintained by selecting resistant plants in the segregated populations.

AB White-grained wheat cultivars have long been recognized to be less resistant to preharvest sprouting (PHS) than the red-grained ones. Previously two QTLs for grain dormancy, QPhs.ocs-3A.1 (QPhs-3AS) and QPhs.ocs-4A.1 (QPhs-4AL) were identified in a highly dormant Japanese red wheat, Zenkoujikomugi (Zen). Aiming at improvement of PHS tolerance in white-grained wheat, the introgression effect of these two QTLs in a white-grained population consisting of 40 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between Zen and white-grained Spica was examined here. Random 20 RILs with red grains were also developed from the same cross and used as a control population. The RILs were grown in the field and in the glasshouse to evaluate the grain dormancy by germination test. Several SSR markers closely linked to the QPhs-3AS and QPhs-4AL were used to estimate the alleles at the QTLs. Dormancy variation in the RILs was significantly associated with the differences for grain color and the alleles at QPhs-3AS over several years. Although allelic variation was detected in a SSR marker closely linked to QPhs-4AL there was no difference in germination data between the Zen-allele and the Spica-allele groups. As expected, the red-grained RILs with the Zen allele at QPhs-3AS were the most dormant. Some white-grained RILs with the Zen allele at QPhs-3AS showed higher dormancy compared to the red-grained RILs with the alternative allele. These results demonstrated that introgression of the QPhs-3AS gene could contribute to the increased grain dormancy in white-grained wheat.

AB To assess the genetic diversity among China's cultivated barley, sequence tagged site (STS) marker analysis was carried out to characterize 109 morphologically distinctive accessions originating from five Chinese eco-geographical zones. Fourteen polymorphic STS markers representing at least one in each chromosome were chosen for the analysis. The 14 STS markers revealed a total of 47 alleles, with an average of 3.36 alleles per locus (range 2-8). The proportion of polymorphic loci per population averaged 0.84 (range 0.71-1.00); the mean gene diversity averaged 0.39 (range 0.28-0.49). The means of P and H (e) were highest in the Yangtze reaches and Southern zone (P = 1.00; H (e) = 0.46) and lowest (P = 0.71 He = 0.28) in the Yellow river reaches zone. The STS diversity in different zones is quite different from the morphology diversity. The STS variation was partitioned into 17% among the zone and 83% within the zone. Both cluster and principal coordinate analyses clearly separated the accessions into a dispersed group (mostly two-rowed barley with a lower mean GS value) and a concentrated group (mostly six-rowed barley with a higher mean GS value) according to the spike characteristic with only a few exceptions. The accessions from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau formed a distinctive subgroup and can be distinguished from the concentrated group. The role of Tibet in the origin and evolution of cultivated barley has been discussed.

AB Natural hybridization and backcrossing between Aegilops cylindrica and Triticum aestivum can lead to intro-gression of wheat DNA into the wild species. Hybrids between Ae. cylindrica and wheat lines bearing herbicide resistance (bar), reporter (gus), fungal disease resistance (kp4), and increased insect tolerance (gna) transgenes were produced by pollination of emasculated Ae. cylindrica plants. F-1 hybrids were backcrossed to Ae. cylindrica under open-pollination conditions, and first backcrosses were selfed using pollen bags. Female fertility of F, ranged from 0.03 to 0.6%. Eighteen percent of the sown BC1s germinated and flowered. Chromosome numbers ranged from 30 to 84 and several of the plants bore wheat-specific sequence-characterized amplified regions (SCARs) and the bar gene. Self fertility in two BC1 plants was 0.16 and 5.21%, and the others were completely self-sterile. Among 19 BC1S1 individuals one plant was transgenic, had 43 chromosomes, contained the bar gene, and survived glufosinate treatments. The other BC1S1 plants had between 28 and 31 chromosomes, and several of them carried SCARs specific to wheat A and D genomes. Fertility of these plants was higher under open-pollination conditions than by selfing and did not necessarily correlate with even or euploid chromosome number. Some individuals having supernumerary wheat chromosomes recovered frill fertility.

AB Genetic diversity was investigated for forty populations of ten Elymus species from the Tibetan and Inner Mongolian plateaus of China using allozyme and micro-satellite markers. The two assays differed in the amount of polymorphism detected. Micro-satellites detected the higher amounts of polymorphism. For allozymes and micro-satellite markers, between populations of each species, the proportion of polymorphic loci, heterozygosity and Shannon's Information index ranged from 0.1667 to 0.833, and 0.455 to 1.00, respectively, 0.0800 to 0.2528 and 0.1622 to 0.3619, respectively, and 0.1173 to 0.3769 and 0.2248 to 0.5318 respectively. As for gene flow at the species and population levels, limited gene flow was found between populations within species and between species. From a geographical standpoint, samples from different regions showed a range of values. Populations from the Tibetan Plateau of China had higher genetic variation than from the Inner Mongolian plateau both using allozyme and micro-satellite markers.

AB Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph, Gibberella zeae) is the predominant causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat resulting in yearly losses through reduction in grain yield and quality and accumulation of fungal generated toxins in grain. Numerous fungal genes potentially involved in virulence have been identified and studies with deletion mutants to ascertain their role are in progress. Although wheat field trials with wild-type and mutant strains are critical to understand the role these genes may play in the disease process, the interpretation of field trial data is complicated by FHB generated by indigenous species of F graminearum. This report describes the development of a SYBR green-based real time PCR assay that quantifies the total F graminearum genomic DNA in a plant sample as well as the total F graminearum genomic DNA contributed from a strain containing a common fungal selectable marker used to create deletion mutants. We found our method more sensitive, reproducible and accurate than other similar recently described assays and comparable to the more expensive probe-based assays. This assay will allow investigators to correlate the amount of disease observed in wheat field trials to the E graminearum mutant strains being examined. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Crown rot (causal agent Fusarium pseudograminearum) is a fungal disease of major significance to wheat cultivation in Australia. A doubled haploid wheat population was produced from a cross between line 'W21MMT70', which displays partial seedling and adult plant (field) resistance to crown rot, and 'Mendos', which is moderately susceptible in seedling tests but partially resistant in field trials. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) based on seedling trial data did not reveal markers for crown rot resistance. A framework map was produced consisting of 128 microsatellite markers, four phenotypic markers, and one sequence tagged site marker. To this map 331 previously screened AFLP markers were then added. Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified with composite interval mapping across all of the three seedling trials conducted. These QTL are located on chromosomes 2B, 2D and 5D. The 2D and 5D QTL are inherited from the line 'W21MMT70', whereas the 2B QTL is inherited from 'Mendos'. These loci are different from those associated with crown rot resistance in other wheat populations that have been examined, and may represent an opportunity for pyramiding QTL to provide more durable resistance to crown rot.

AB The stem rust resistance gene Sr31, transferred from rye (Secale cereale) into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) imparts resistance to all the virulent pathotypes of stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) found in India. Wheat genotypes including carriers and non-carriers of the Sr31 gene were analysed using arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR). AP-PCR markers viz. SS30.2(580)(H) associated with the Sr31 gene and SS26.1(1100) associated with the allele for susceptibility were identified. Linkage between the markers and phenotypes was confirmed by analysing an F, population obtained from a cross between a resistant and a susceptible genotype. The markers were tightly linked to the respective alleles. Both the AP-PCR markers were converted into sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, viz. SCSS30.2(576) and SCSS26.1(1100) respectively. The markers were validated in two more segregating populations and 49 wheat genotypes. Using both markers it was possible to distinguish the homozygous from the heterozygous carriers of the Sr31 gene in the F, generation. The markers developed in this study can be used for pyramiding of the Sr31 gene with other rust resistance genes and in marker-assisted selection.

AB Powdery mildew is one of the major diseases of wheat in regions with a maritime or semi-continental climate which can strongly affect grain yield. The objective of the study was to identify and compare quantitative resistance to powdery mildew of line RE9001 at the adult plant and vernalized seedling stages. RE9001 has no known Pin gene and shows a high level of adult plant resistance in the field. Using 104 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of an RE9001 x 'Courtot' F8 population, a genetic map was developed with 363 markers distributed over 26 linkage groups and covering 3825 cM. The global map density was 1 locus/10.3 cM. RILs were assessed under field and tunnel greenhouse conditions for 2 years in two locations. Eleven quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected at the adult stage and they explained 63% of the variation, depending on the environment. Three QTLs were found, at least, in the two environments. One QTL from RE9001, mapped on chromosome 213, was stable in each environment. This QTL, QPm.inra.2B, explained 10.3-36.6% of the variation and could be mapped in the vicinity of the Pm6 gene. At the vernalized seedling stage, one QTL detected by the isolate 93-27 could be an allele of the Pm3g gene present in 'Courtot'. No residual effect of the Pm3g gene was detected at either stage. Markers flanking the QTL 2B could be useful tools to combine resistance to powdery mildew in wheat cultivars.

AB A recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population (F-8) was generated by crossing Vigna mungo (cv. TU 94-2) with Vigna mungo var. silrestris and screened for mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) resistance. The inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker technique was employed to identify markers linked to the MYMV resistance gene. Of the 100 primers screened, 54 showed amplification of which 36 exhibited polymorphism between the parents TU 94-2 (resistant) and V. mungo var. silrestris (susceptible). Individual plants from 53 RIL populations were analysed and one marker (ISSR811(1357)) was identified as tightly linked to the MYMV resistant gene at 6.8 cM. Both the phenotype as well as the ISSR811(1357) marker segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio. The ISSR811(1357) marker was sequenced and sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers were designed (YMV1-F and YMV1-R) to amplify the marker. Screening for the SCAR marker in the RIL population distinguished the MYMV resistant and susceptible plants, agreeing well with the phenotypic data. The ISSR811(1357) marker was validated using diverse blackgram genotypes differing in their MYMV reaction. The marker will be useful for the development of MYMV-resistant genotypes in blackgram.

AB Plant disease resistance gene (R gene) and defense response gene encode some conserved motifs. In the present work, a PCR strategy was used to clone resistance gene analogs (RGAs) and defense gene analogs (DGAs) from Sea-island cotton variety Hai7124 using oligonucleotide primers based on the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and serine/threonine kinase (STK) in the R-gene and pathogenesis-related proteins of class 2 (PR2) of defense response gene. 79 NBS sequences, 21 STK sequences and 11 DGAs were cloned from disease-resistance cotton. Phylogenic analysis of 79 NBS-RGAs and NBS-RGAs nucleotide sequences of cotton already deposited in GenBank identified one new sub-cluster. The deduced amino acid sequences of NBS-RGAs and STK-RGAs were divided into two distinct groups respectively: Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) group and non-TIR group, A group and B group. The expression of RGAs and DGAs having consecutive open reading frame (OiFIF) was also investigated and it was found that 6 NBS-RGAs and 1 STK-RGA were induced, and 1 DGA was up-regulated by infection of Verticillium dahliae strain VD8. 4 TIR-NBS-RGAs and 4 non-TIRNBS-RGAs were arbitrarily used as probes for Southern-blotting. There existed 2-10 blotted bands. In addition, since three non-TIR-NBS-RGAs have the same hybridization pattern, we conjecture that these three RGAs form a cluster distribution in the genome.

AB A wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line 4844 with superior numbers of florets and grains per spike was derived from the cross between Fukohokomugi wheat and Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. In order to determine the genetic control of floret and kernel number per spike in this line, chromosome addition and substitution lines that were derived from line 4844 were characterized by means of in situ hybridization, microsatellite (SSR), and gliadin analyses. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis with biotinylated P genomic DNA of A. cristatum as a probe demonstrated that the increased number of florets and grains in a spike was associated with the introgression of an A. cristatum chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using a repetitive sequence, pAs1, derived from Aegilops squarrosa L., indicated the replacement of chromosome 6D of wheat in the wheat-A. cristatum chromosome substitution lines. This was confirmed by microsatellite analyses with wheat SSR markers specific for chromosome 6D, suggesting that the A. cristatum chromosome was homoeologous to group 6 and was therefore designated as 6P. This conclvsion was further confirmed by amplification using EST-SSR markers and gliadin analysis. The increased number of florets and kernels within a spike of the wheat-A. cristatum hybrids thus was controlled by gene(s) located on A. cristatum chromosome 6P.

AB Wheat expressed sequence tags (wESTs) were identified in a genomic interval predicted to span the Lr34/Yr18 slow rusting region on chromosome 7DS and that corresponded to genes located in the syntenic region of rice chromosome 6 (between 2.02 and 2.38 Mb). A subset of the wESTs was also used to identify corresponding bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the diploid D genome of wheat (Aegilops tauschii). Conservation and deviation of micro-colinearity within blocks of genes were found in the D genome BACs relative to the orthologous sequences in rice. Extensive RFLP analysis using the wEST derived clones as probes on a panel of wheat genetic stocks with or without Lr34/Yr18 revealed monomorphic patterns as the norm in this region of the wheat genome. A similar pattern was observed with single nucleotide polymorphism analysis on a subset of the wEST derived clones and subclones from corresponding D genome BACs. One exception was a wEST derived clone that produced a consistent RFLP pattern that distinguished the Lr34/Yr18 genetic stocks and well-established cultivars known either to possess or lack Lr34/Yr18. Conversion of the RFLP to a codominant sequence tagged site (csLV34) revealed a bi-allelic locus, where a variant size of 79 bp insertion in an intron sequence was associated with lines or cultivars that lacked Lr34/Yr18. This association with Lr34/Yr18 was validated in wheat cultivars from diverse backgrounds. Genetic linkage between csLV34 and Lr34/Yr18 was estimated at 0.4 cM

AB Genome characterization of 14 hexaploid lines that spontaneously appeared in octoploid Triticales was carried out by sequential genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization, high molecular weight glutenin subunits and SSR marker analyses. All of the lines showed a chromosome constitution of complete A and B genomes, and a composite genome consisting of the chromosomes of D and R genomes. The composite genome of the 11 lines consisted of chromosomes 1R, 2D, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R and 7R, that of the two lines were 1D, 2D, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R and 7R, and that of one line was 1R, 2D, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6D and 7R. The incompatibility of the D and R genomes in common wheat genetic background, preferential retention of chromosome 2D and importance of these lines for the development of hexaploid Triticale are discussed in this report.

AB In the ideal case, molecular markers used for marker-assisted selection are allele-specific even if the alleles differ only by a few nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding sequence of target genes. Such 'perfect' markers are completely correlated with the trait of interest. In hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) the Pm3 locus encodes seven alleles (Pm3a-Pm3g) conferring resistance to different races of Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, the agent of powdery mildew, a major disease of bread wheat. All Pm3 alleles are known at the molecular level. Here, we generated specific markers for the Pm3 alleles based on nucleotide polymorphisms of coding and adjacent non-coding regions. The specificity of these markers was validated in a collection of 93 modern or historically important cultivars and breeding lines of wheat and spelt (Triticum spelta L.). These markers confirmed the presence of the predicted Pm3 alleles in 31 varieties and lines known to carry Pm3 resistance alleles. In a few varieties, Pm3 alleles different from alleles previously described based on pathogenicity tests or tightly linked markers were observed. In all these cases, the identity of the marker-detected Pm3 alleles was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Pm3 markers confirmed the absence of known Pm3 resistance alleles in 54 European wheat and spelt varieties in which Pm3 alleles had not been previously identified. These results indicate that the developed markers are highly diagnostic for specific Pm3 resistance alleles in a wide range of varieties and breeding lines, and will be useful (1) for identifying Pm3 alleles in the wheat gene pool, (2) for efficient marker-assisted selection of these genes, and (3) for combining multiple Pm3 alleles within a single cultivar through transgenic approaches.

AB Maternal diet during pregnancy has been proposed to modify female offspring's later susceptibility to develop breast cancer; however, most of the dietary factors identified thus far have led to increased risk. To identify dietary factors that might reduce offspring's breast cancer risk, pregnant rat dams were fed diets containing 6% fiber originating either from cellulose (control), or oat, whole wheat or defatted flax flour. At birth, dams were switched to the AIN93 semi-purified diet. Mammary tumor incidence and multiplicity, induced by administering the offspring 5 mg 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) at the age of 50 days, was reduced in the whole wheat flour-exposed offspring and increased in the defatted flax-exposed offspring. To identify the mechanisms mediating the effects of in utero dietary exposures, changes in mammary gland morphology and gene expression were assessed before puberty onset (3 weeks of age) and at the time rats are most susceptible to malignant transformation (8 weeks of age). The number of terminal end buds (TEBs), i.e., the targets of malignant transformation, was reduced in the mammary glands of whole wheat- and oat flour-exposed offspring, as compared to the controls. Further, the number of apoptotic epithelial cells (based on ISOL assay) was elevated in the whole wheat Hour offspring, but no changes in cell proliferation (PCNA), estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) or cyclin D1 mRNA or protein levels were seen. The mRNA and/or protein levels of BRCA1 and p53 were significantly increased in the mammary glands of whole wheat flour offspring. Further, the levels of 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of DNA damage, were significantly reduced in these rats, suggesting that maternal dietary exposure to whole wheat during pregnancy may reduce offspring's breast cancer risk by improving DNA damage repair mechanisms.

AB Reduction of plant height has played a significant role in improving wheat production and knowledge of dwarfing genes in Chinese wheat will be very important for developing high yielding cultivars. Molecular markers were used to detect the presence of genes Rht-B1b (Rht1), Rht-D1b (Rht2) and Rht8 in 220 wheat genotypes from autumn-sown wheat regions in China. They include landmark landraces, leading cultivars and core parents involved in wheat breeding from the 1950s to the present. Results indicated that Rht-D1b and Rht8 dominate with frequencies of 45.5% and 46.8%, respectively, followed by Rht-B1b with a frequency of 24.5%. The frequencies of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b increased, from 8.6 to 32.2% and 36.2 to 53.4%, respectively, whereas the frequency of Rht8 has remained constant over time, when compared with cultivars released before and after 1990. This indicates that both the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b were successfully used in wheat production in Chinese environments. Our study shows that Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b can be used in the post-anthesis heat stressed environments. Rht-B1b in Chinese wheats is derived from two sources, viz., Norin 10 and the Italian introduction St2422/464 (Rht-B1b and Rht8). The identity of Rht-B1b in these two sources still needs to be confirmed. Suwon 86 carrying both Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, and Chinese cultivars, Huixianhong and Yaobaomai, are the primary sources of Rht-D1b in Chinese wheats. It is likely that Rht-D1b in Youbaomai derives from an unknown introduction. Italian introductions such as Funo and Abbondanza, and Lovrin 10 with the 1B/1R translocation, and Chinese landraces are the three major sources of Rht8. This information will be very valuable for wheat breeding in China, and internationally.

AB Microsatellite markers were used to analyse the biodiversity of 57 accessions of different subspecies and varieties of wild Aegilops tauschii (2n = 2x = 14; D genome) collected across the major areas where it grows in Iran. Levels of diversity were high, with numbers of alleles averaging 7.3 (ranging up to 12) and polymorphism information contents averaging 0.6591. One accession was notably more similar to two of the D genome in hexaploid wheats (Triticum aestivum) used as outgroups. Within the Ae. tauschii accessions, no markers were characteristic for taxa or geographical origin, suggesting high gene flow between the subspecies and varieties, although some groupings, which could be related to geographical origin, were evident. This survey demonstrates the high diversity present in wild goatgrass in Iran, and indicates that there is value in sampling for useful genes for wheat breeding.

AB In allopolyploid species, fair meiosis could be challenged by homeologous chromosome pairing and is usually achieved by the action of homeologous pairing suppressor genes. Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) haploids (AC, n = 19) represent an attractive model for studying the mechanisms used by allopolyploids to ensure the diploid-like meiotic pairing pattern. In oilseed rape haploids, homeologous chromosome pairing at metaphase I was found to be genetically based and controlled by a major gene, PrBn, segregating in a background of polygenic variation. In this study, we have mapped PrBn within a 10-cM interval on the C genome linkage group DY15 and shown that PrBn displays incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity We have identified three to six minor QTL/BTL that have slight additive effects on the amount of pairing at metaphase I but do not interact with PrBn. We have also detected a number of other loci that interact epistatically, notably with PrBn. Our results support the idea that, as in other polyploid species, metaphase I homeologous pairing in oilseed rape haploids is controlled by an integrated system of several genes, which function in a complex manner.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important crops worldwide. However, because of its large, hexaploid, highly repetitive genome it is a challenge to develop efficient means for molecular analysis and genetic improvement in wheat. To better understand the composition and molecular evolution of the hexaploid wheat homoeologous genomes and to evaluate the potential of BAC-end sequences (BES) for marker development, we have followed a chromosome-specific strategy and generated 11 Mb of random BES from chromosome 3B, the largest chromosome of bread wheat. The sequence consisted of about 86% of repetitive elements, 1.2% of coding regions, and 13% remained unknown. With 1.2% of the sequence length corresponding to coding sequences, 6000 genes were estimated for chromosome 3B. New repetitive sequences were identified, including a Triticineae-specific tandem repeat (Fat) that represents 0.6% of the B-genome and has been differentially amplified in the homoeologous genomes before polyploidization. About 10% of the BES contained junctions between nested transposable elements that were used to develop chromosome-specific markers for physical and genetic mapping. Finally, sequence comparison with 2.9 Mb of random sequences from the D-genome of Aegilops tauschii suggested that the larger size of the B-genome is due to a higher content in repetitive elements. It also indicated which families of transposable elements are mostly responsible for differential expansion of the homoeologous wheat genomes during evolution. Our data demonstrate that BAC-end sequencing from flow-sorted chromosomes is a powerful tool for analysing the structure and evolution of polyploid and highly repetitive genomes.

AB Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are often used as a marker of plant defense reactions. Some endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (Gns) genes encode proteins that belong to the PR protein family 2 (PR-2). Although the number of homologous family member genes is significantly greater in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) compared to other model plants, earlier studies did not evaluate the possible contribution of their homelogs to hybridization signals in Northern blot analysis. In this study, we have examined whether routine transcriptional analyses of a PR gene is of high reliability or not by isolating six highly similar Gns genes (TaGlb2a, TaGlb2b, TaGlb2c, TaGlb2d, TaGlb2e, and TaGlb2f) and characterizing their expression patterns in detail. While TaGlb2b was shown to be a PR-2 gene, transcription of TaGlb2c and TaGlb2d was not induced upon infection with either powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis) or head blight (Fusarium graminearum) pathogens; their transcripts were most abundant in healthy spikes (lemmas and in particular paleae). Therefore, in some cases, the conventional analyses do not necessarily provide accurate information on expression pattern of a PR gene in hexaploid wheat. This is also the first report of wheat genes that are specifically expressed in lemma/palea tissues of flowering spikelets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID RESISTANCE
AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) damage leads to occasional massive losses in all wheat producing areas, causing downgrading of grain quality, that severely limits end-use applications and results in substantial financial losses to farmers and food processors. Red grain color is a traditional marker for resistance to sprouting in wheat breeding programs, however red-grained genotype alone does not always guarantee effective resistance. The objective of this work was to find genes for resistance to PHS and investigate its inheritance in Brazilian wheat cultivars. Genetic variation for dormancy was investigated in the parents, F, and 300 F, lines derived from the cross Frontana X OR1 and its reciprocal. The germination/ dormancy sprouted grains was evaluated on fifty seeds per replication, germinated in paper towel rolls at 20 degrees C for 5 days. A bimodal distribution for dormancy occurred in the Frontana/OR1 and OR1/Frontana derived F-2 populations. The mean ratio of dormant and non-dormant seeds of the cross and its reciprocal was 85:1115, fitting a digenic model of 1: 15 (P < 0.05). In fact, all non after-ripened F-1 seeds germinated. The F-2 distribution indicates that two major genes, here called A,a and B,b, control seed dormancy, which it appears to be recessive to dormancy. Only the homozygous aabb is dormant. As expected, there was no effect of maternal tissues.

AB In spite of commercial use of heterosis in agriculture, the molecular basis of heterosis is poorly understood. In this study, heterosis was estimated for eight root traits in 20 wheat hybrids derived from a NC Design II mating scheme. Positive mid-parent heterosis was detected in 96 of 160 hybrid-trait combinations, and positive high-parent heterosis was detected in 79 of 160 hybrid-trait combinations. Improved differential display was used to analyze alterations in gene expression between hybrids and their parents in roots at the jointing stage. More than 990 fragments were repeatedly displayed, among which 27.52% were differentially expressed between hybrids and their parents. Four differential expression patterns were observed. Thirty differentially expressed cDNA fragments and three genes with open reading frames were cloned, and their expression patterns were confirmed by reverse-northern blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, respectively. We concluded that these differentially expressed genes, though mostly with unknown function, could play important roles for hybrids to demonstrate heterosis in root system traits.

AB H22 is a major resistance gene conferring high-level of antibiosis to Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. It was previously assigned to wheat chromosome 1D through monosomic analysis (Raupp et al. in J Hered 84:142-145, 1993). The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers that can be used for marker-assisted selection for wheat breeding, and to further map this gene toward map-based cloning. Forty-five simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers specific to chromosome 1D were evaluated for linkage to H22 using a segregating population consisting of 192 F-2:3 families, which were derived from the cross Tugela-Dn1 x KS85WGRC01(H22). The STS Xhor2kv and SSR Xgdm33 are two flanking markers that are tightly linked to H22 at genetic distances of 0.3 and 1.0 cM, respectively. Five other SSR markers including Xgpw7082, Xwmc147, Xcfd15, Xwmc432 and Xwmc336 were also linked to H22 at the distance from 0.8 to 20.8 cM. Analysis of Chinese Spring (CS) deletion lines revealed that all the H22-linked markers are located distal to the breakpoint of del 1DS-5, indicating that the H22 gene is located at the distal 30% region on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1D. Genomic comparison suggested that the H22 gene is located in the same or similar chromosomal region as the leaf rust resistance genes Lr21 and Lr40 on 1DS, and orthologous to the H9 gene cluster of 1AS.

AB Powdery mildew is a major fungal disease in wheat growing areas worldwide. A novel source of resistance to wheat powdery mildew present in the germplasm line NC97BGTD7 was genetically characterized as a monogenic trait in greenhouse and field trials using F-2 derived lines from a NC97BGTD7 X Saluda cross. Microsatellite markers were used to map and tag this resistance gene, now designated Pm34. Three co-dominant microsatellite markers linked to Pm34 were identified and their most likely order was established as: Xbarc177-5D, 5.4cM, Pm34, 2.6cM, Xbarc144-5D, 14cM, Xgwm272-5D. These microsatellite markers were previously mapped to the long arm of the 5D chromosome and their positions were confirmed using Chinese Spring nullitetrasomic Nulli5D-tetra5A and ditelosomic Dt5DL lines. Pm2, the only other known Pm gene on chromosome 5D, has been mapped to the short arm and its specificity is different from that of Pm34.

AB The tightly linked puroindoline genes, Pina and Pinb, control grain texture in wheat, with wild type forms of both giving soft, and a sequence alteration affecting protein expression or function in either giving rise to hard wheat. Previous experiments have shown that addition of wild type Pina in the presence of mutated Pinb gave intermediate grain texture but addition of wild type Pinb gave soft grain. This raises questions as to whether Pina may be less functional than Pinb. Our goal here was to develop and characterize wheat lines expressing the wild type Pina-D1a sequence in hard wheat with the null mutation (Pina-D1b) for Pina. Three transgenic lines plus Bobwhite were evaluated in two environments. Grain texture, grain protein, and kernel weight were determined for the transgenic lines and Bobwhite. The three transgenic lines had soft phenotype, and none of the transgenic lines differed from Bobwhite for grain protein or kernel weight. The soft phenotype was accompanied by increases in Pina transcript accumulation. Total Triton X-114 extractable PINA and PINB increased from 2.5 to 5.5 times those from a soft wheat reference sample, and friabilin, PINA and PINB bound to starch, increased from 3.8 to 7.8 times those of the soft wheat reference. Bobwhite showed no starch bound PINA, but transgenic lines had levels from 5.3 to 13.7 times those of the soft wheat reference sample. Starch bound PINB in transgenic lines also increased from 0.9 to 2.5 times that for the soft wheat reference sample. The transgenic expression of wild type Pina sequence in the Pina null genotype gave soft grain with the characteristics of soft wheat including increased starch bound friabilin. The results support the hypothesis that both wild type Pin genes need to be present for friabilin formation and soft grain.

AB Jointed goatgrass is an important weed of wheat in the United States and other parts of the world. Under field conditions, wheat and jointed goatgrass can hybridize and produce backcross derivatives, a situation that may allow gene flow between these two species. In order to gain a better understanding of the factors governing gene flow, a study to characterize patterns of mating between these two species was undertaken. Chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers were used to evaluate the parentage of 413 first-generation backcross (BC1) seeds obtained from 127 wheat-jointed goatgrass F-1 hybrids, produced naturally under field conditions. Of' the 127 hybrids evaluated, 109 (85.8%) had jointed goatgrass as the female parent, whereas the remaining 18 F-1 plants (14.2%) had wheat as the female parent. Of the 413 BC1 plants analyzed, 358 (86.7%) had wheat and 24 (5.8%) had jointed goatgrass as the male backcross parent. The male parentage of 31 BC1 (7.5%) plants could not be determined. Under natural field conditions, wheat was the prevalent pollen donor for the production of hybrids and first-generation backcross derivatives. However, hybrids and backcrosses with jointed goatgrass as the male parent also were observed. Thus, the establishment and persistence of a zone of hybridization between these species would result in the development of jointed goatgrass carrying wheat genes.

AB Background: The mucin MUC16 and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein mesothelin likely facilitate the peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors. The biochemical basis and the kinetics of the binding between these two glycoproteins are not clearly understood. Here we have addressed this deficit and provide further evidence supporting the role of the MUC16-mesothelin interaction in facilitating cell-cell binding under conditions that mimic the peritoneal environment.
   Results: In this study we utilize recombinant-Fc tagged human mesothelin to measure the binding kinetics of this glycoprotein to MUC16 expressed on the ovarian tumor cell line OVCAR-3. OVCAR-3 derived sublines that did not express MUC16 showed no affinity for mesothelin. In a flow cytometry-based assay mesothelin binds with very high affinity to the MUC16 on the OVCAR-3 cells with an apparent K-d of 5-10 nM. Maximum interaction occurs within 5 mins of incubation of the recombinant mesothelin with the OVCAR-3 cells and significant binding is observed even after 10 sec. A five-fold molar excess of soluble MUC16 was unable to completely inhibit the binding of mesothelin to the OVCAR-3 cells. Oxidation of the MUC16 glycans, removal of its N-linked oligosaccharides, and treatment of the mucin with wheat germ agglutinin and erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin abrogates its binding to mesothelin. These observations suggest that at least a subset of the MUC16asscociated N-glycans is required for binding to mesothelin. We also demonstrate that MUC16 positive ovarian tumor cells exhibit increased adherence to A431 cells transfected with mesothelin (A431-Meso(+)). Only minimal adhesion is observed between MUC16 knockdown cells and A431-Meso(+) cells. The binding between the MUC16 expressing ovarian tumor cells and the A431-Meso(+) cells occurs even in the presence of ascites from patients with ovarian cancer.
   Conclusion: The strong binding kinetics of the mesothelin-MUC16 interaction and the cell adhesion between ovarian tumor cells and A431-Meso(+) even in the presence of peritoneal fluid strongly support the importance of these two glycoproteins in the peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors. The demonstration that N-linked glycans are essential for mediating mesothleinMUC16 binding may lead to novel therapeutic targets to control the spread of ovarian carcinoma.

AB Leaf rust of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina (formerly P. recondita f. sp. tritici), is one of the most important foliar diseases of this crop. Lr37 rust resistance gene, which confers resistance in wheat against leaf rust, was introgressed into cultivated wheat from Aegilops ventricosa Tausch. Rust races with virulence to Lr37 have been identified in different countries, but it still provides resistance to a wide range of races and is useful in combination with other resistance genes. There are no reports about the presence, frequency and origin of Lr37 in Argentinean wheat cultivars. In this work, we analyzed 88 registered Argentinean wheat cultivars developed by different breeding companies and institutions during the last 15 years by means of a molecular marker which is diagnostic of the 2NS-2AS translocation which carries Lr37. Only 4 cultivars showed the amplification product associated with this chromosome fragment. These four cultivars which carry the translocated 2NS-2AS chromosome were registered by the same breeding company during the last seven years and all of them have European germplasm in their genealogy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the presence of Lr37 in registered South American cultivars.

AB An optimal pooling system, called Accurate and Fast Target Screening, has been developed for high-throughput identifying the rare marker-free transformants. This system can identify targets between 10- and 100-fold more efficiently than analysis of individual samples. By calculating the efficiency for different proportions of targets and the optimal group size in a worst case scenario, we are able to estimate an upper limit for the number of tests that are required. The application of this system to determine the transgene in an artificially constructed population of transgenic and non-transgenic wheat lines successfully identified the 10 positive samples located randomly with 990 negative samples using only 92 PCR reactions. The same approach was also applied to determine transgene expression by SDS-PAGE of seed proteins. This system gives unambiguous positive or negative results and should facilitate marker-free transformation.

AB Stored cereal crops form the major component of the world's food supply. It is well known that post-harvest crop losses, due to insects and microbes, cause significant economic waste in both developed and developing countries. In general, the environment in storage facilities is prone to rapid pest development, leading to significant grain losses. Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae L.) is one pest of cereal crops that deposits its eggs on or in a seed. To detect rice weevil in stored rice, we developed PCR-based molecular markers of Sitophilus oryzae. Several sets of PCR primers from the 'internal transcribed spacer 2' gene of S. oryzae were analyzed to identify molecular markers that are specific to the S. oryzae genome. Among six sets of molecular markers identified, three were found to be useful for identifying rice weevil. Our results demonstrate that a PCR marker system permits rapid and reliable identification of weevil in stored grain. Furthermore, this PCR assay would expand the choice of tools for monitoring populations of the weevil in pest management programmes.

AB Two powdery mildew resistance genes were identified from Aegilops tauschii accessions Y201 and Y212 and mapped using two different F-2 populations derived from the crosses between susceptible accession Y2272 and Y201, and susceptible accession Y2263 and Y212. Genetic analysis of resistance to powdery mildew indicated that the resistance of Y201 was controlled by a single dominant gene, whereas the resistance of Y212 was controlled by a single recessive gene. We have temporarily designated these genes as PmY201 and PmY212, respectively. By bulk segregation analysis, six microsatellite markers including Xgwm174, cfd26, cfd57, cfd102, Xgwm583 and Xgwm639 were found to be linked to PmY201 with genetic distances of 5.2, 7.7, 9.6, 12.5, 20.2 and 22.1 cM, respectively. Five SSR markers, including cfd57, Xgwm182, cfd7, cfd102, and cfd12, were found to be linked to PmY212 with distances of 5.6, 7.2, 11.5, 14.7, and 18.5 cM, respectively. According to the locations of the linked markers, the two resistance genes were located in the 5DL region. Based on the chromosomal locations and the resistance patterns of the two genes, we propose that PmY201 and PmY212 are two novel powdery mildew resistance genes, and are suitable for marker-assisted selection.

AB Detailed molecular characterisation of transgene loci is a requirement for gaining regulatory approval for environmental release of genetically modified crops. In cereals, it is generally accepted that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation generates cleaner transgene loci with lower copy number and fewer rearrangements than those generated by biolistics. However, in wheat there has been little detailed analysis of T-DNA insertions at genetic and molecular level. Wheat lines transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens with bar and gusA (GUS) genes were subjected to genetic and molecular analysis. Unlike previous studies of transgene loci in wheat, we used functional assays for PAT and GUS proteins, combined with PCR and Southern analysis to detect the presence, copy number, linkage and transmission of two transgenes inserted in the same T-DNA. Thirty-four independent transgenic lines were categorised into three types: type I events (38% of total) where the gusA and bar genes displayed complete genetic linkage, segregating together as a single functional locus at the expected ratio of 3:1; type II events (18%), which possessed two or more transgene loci each containing gusA and bar; and type III events (44%), containing an incomplete T-DNA in which either the gusA or bar gene was lost. Most lines in this last category had lost the bar gene situated near the left T-DNA border. Southern analysis indicated that 30% of all lines possessed a single T-DNA copy containing gusA and bar. However, when data on expression and molecular analysis are combined, only 23% of all lines have single copy T-DNAs in which both gene cassettes are functioning. We also report on the presence of plasmid backbone DNA sequence in transgene loci detected using primer pairs outside the left and right T-DNA borders and within the plasmid selectable marker (NptI) gene. Approximately two thirds of the lines contained some vector backbone DNA, more frequently adjacent to the left border. Taken together, these data imply unstable left border function causing premature T-strand termination or read-through into vector backbone. As far as we are aware, this is the first report revealing near border T-DNA truncation and vector backbone integration in wheat transgenic lines produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB or scab) caused by Fusarium graminearum is a worldwide serious disease in wheat. Exploitation and genetic studies of elite resistance sources can speed up the development of resistant cultivars. To characterize the inheritance of host plant resistance in two new lines, 'CJ 9306' and 'CJ 9403', developed from a recurrent selection programme in China, six generations P-1, P-2, F-1, F-2, B-1 and B-2 of four crosses and 137 F-6 : 7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from one cross were evaluated in the greenhouse for scab resistance using single-floret inoculation. The data of area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) in F-2, backcross (BC) and RIL populations exhibited mono-modal distributions without clear-cut demarcations and skewing towards resistance. An additive-dominance model was well-fitted, additive effects played a predominating role, and dominance effects were also significant. Continuous distributions with two major peaks and one minor peak for the number or percentage of scabby spikelets (NSS or PSS) in segregating populations implied the existence of major genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance. The estimates of broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities based on the six-generation experiment were 56-76% and 26-67% respectively. The estimates of broad-sense heritabilities based on ANOVA with RILs were 89-90%. These two improved lines with excellent scab resistance and good agronomic traits are of interest for wheat breeding and production.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance derived from wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum chromosome 7E and to determine whether this resistance can augment resistance in combination with other FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) or genes in wheat. The 'Chinese Spring'-Lophopyrum elongatum disomic substitution line 7E(7B) was crossed to three wheat lines: 'Ning 7840', L3, and L4. F-2 populations were evaluated for type II resistance with the single-floret inoculation method in the greenhouse. Simple sequence repeat markers associated with Fhb1 in 'Ning 7840' and L4 and markers located on chromosome 7E were genotyped in each population. Marker-trait association was analysed with one-way or two-way analysis of variance. The research showed that, in the three populations, the average number of diseased spikelets (NDS) in plants with chromosome 7E is 1.2, 3.1 and 3.2, vs. NDS of 3.3, 7.2 and 9.1 in plants without 7E, a reduction in NDS of 2.1, 4.1 and 5.9 in the respective populations. The QTL on 7E and the Fhb1 gene augment disease resistance when combined. The effect of the QTL on 7E was greater than that on 3BS in this experiment. Data also suggest that the FHB resistance gene derived from L. elongatum is located on the long arm of 7E.

AB Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar 'Massey' were mapped in a previous study. The three QTL were located on chromosomes 2A, 2B and 1B, and explained 50% of the total phenotypic variation. A 293 recombinant inbred line (RIL) breeding population (UJ) derived from the cross of 'USG 3209', a derivative of 'Massey', and 'Jaypee' was used to evaluate the potential effectiveness of marker-assisted selection (MAS) for APR. Powdery mildew severities of the 293 UJ RILs were evaluated in 2002 (F-5 : 6) and 2003 (F-6 : 7) under natural disease pressure in the field. The 293 RILs were also evaluated for disease severity in a 2004 (F-7 : 8) greenhouse experiment using a composite of five different isolates of B. graminis. Selection of RILs possessing the QTL on chromosome 2A, and to a lesser extent, the one on chromosome 1B was effective in identifying powdery mildew resistance in both greenhouse and field experiments. Overall, selecting RILs with QTL on chromosomes 2A and 2B was most successful in identifying highly resistant RILs, which had mean mildew severities of 4.4% and 3.2% in 2002 and 2003 field experiments, respectively. Breeders implementing MAS programs for APR to powdery mildew via selection of RILs containing the two QTL on chromosomes 2A and 2B likely will obtain RILs having high levels of resistance in the field, however combining all three QTL may ensure greater durability.

AB Identification of seedling and slow stripe rust resistance genes is important for gene pyramiding, gene deployment, and developing slow-rusting wheat cultivars to control the disease. A total of 98 Chinese lines were inoculated with 26 pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici for postulation of stripe rust resistance genes effective at the seedling stage. A total of 135 wheat lines were planted at two locations to characterize their slow rusting responses to stripe rust in the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 cropping seasons. Genes Yr2, Yr3a, Yr4a, Yr6, Yr7, Yr9 Yr26 Yr27, and YrSD, either singly or in combinations, were postulated in 72 lines, whereas known resistance genes were not identified in the other 26 accessions. The resistance genes Yr9 and Yr26 were found in 42 and 19 accessions, respectively. Yr3a and Yr4a were detected in two lines, and four lines may contain Yr6. Three lines were postulated to possess YrSD, one carried Yr27, and one may possess Yr7. Thirty-three lines showed slow stripe rusting resistance at two locations in both seasons.

AB Using two divergent nucleotide binding site (NBS) regions from wheat sequences of the NBS-LRR (leucine rich repeat) class, we retrieved 211 wheat and barley NBS-containing resistance gene analogue (RGA) expressed sequence tags (ESTs). These ESTs were grouped into 129 gene sequence groups that contained ESTs that were at least 70% identical at the DNA level over at least 200 bp. Probes were obtained for 89 of these RGA families and chromosome locations were determined for 72 of these probes using nullitetrasomic Chinese Spring wheat lines. RFLP analysis of 49 of these RGA probes revealed 65 mappable polymorphic bands in the doubled haploid Cranbrook x Halberd wheat population (C x H). These bands mapped to 49 loci in C x H. RGA loci were detected on all 21 chromosomes using the nullitetrasomic lines and on 18 chromosomes (linkage groups) in the C x H map. This identified a set of potential markers that could be developed further for use in mapping and ultimately cloning NBS-LRR-type disease resistance genes in wheat.

AB A leaf rust resistance gene Lr19 on the chromosome 7DL of wheat derived from Agropyron elongatum was tagged with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers. The F-2 population of 340 plants derived from a cross between the leaf rust resistant near-isogenic line (NIL) of Thatcher (Tc + Lr19) and leaf rust susceptible line Agra Local that segregated for dominant monogenic leaf rust resistance was utilized for generating the mapping population. The molecular markers were mapped in the F2 derived F-3 homozygous population of 140 seedlings. Sixteen RAPD markers were identified as linked to the alien gene Lr19 among which eight were in a coupling phase linkage. Twelve RAPD markers co-segregated with Lr19 locus. Nine microsatellite markers located on the long arm of chromosome 7D were also mapped as linked to the gene Lr19, including 7 markers which co-segregated with Lr19 locus, thus generating a saturated region carrying 25 molecular markers linked to the gene Lr19 within 10.2 +/- 0.062 cM on either side of the locus. Two RAPD markers S265(512) and S253(737) which flanked the locus Lr19 were converted to sequence characterized amplified region markers SCS265(512) and SCS253(736), respectively. The marker SCS265(512) was linked with Lr19 in a coupling phase and the marker SCS253(736) was linked in a repulsion phase, which when used together mimicked one co-dominant marker capable of distinguishing the heterozygous resistant seedlings from the homozygous resistant. The molecular markers were validated on NILs mostly in Thatcher background isogenic for 44 different Lr genes belonging to both native and alien origin. The validation for polymorphism in common leaf rust susceptible cultivars also confirmed the utility of these tightly linked markers to the gene Lr19 in marker-assisted selection.

AB Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) originated about 8,000 years ago from the hybridization of tetraploid wheat with diploid Aegilops tauschii Coss. containing the D-genome. Thus, the bread wheat D-genome is evolutionary young and shows a low degree of polymorphism in the bread wheat gene pool. To increase marker density around the durable leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 located on chromosome 7DS, we used molecular information from the orthologous region in rice. Wheat expressed sequence tags (wESTs) were identified by homology with the rice genes in the interval of interest, but were monomorphic in the 'Arina' x 'Forno' mapping population. To derive new polymorphic markers, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones representing a total physical size of similar to 1 Mb and belonging to four contigs were isolated from Ae. tauschii by hybridization screening with wheat ESTs. Several BAC clones were low-pass sequenced, resulting in a total of similar to 560 kb of sequence. Ten microsatellite sequences were found, and three of them were polymorphic in our population and were genetically mapped close to Lr34. Comparative analysis of marker order revealed a large inversion between the rice genome and the wheat D-genome. The SWM10 microsatellite is closely linked to Lr34 and has the same allele in the three independent sources of Lr34: 'Frontana', 'Chinese Spring', and 'Forno', as well in most of the genotypes containing Lr34. Therefore, SWM10 is a highly useful marker to assist selection for Lr34 in breeding programs worldwide.

AB A doubled haploid population constructed from a cross between the South Australian wheat cultivars 'Trident' and 'Molineux' was grown under winter Weld conditions, under Weld conditions over summer and under artificial light both with and without vernalisation. The duration from planting to ear-emergence was recorded and QTL associated with heading date were detected using a previously constructed genetic linkage map. Associations were shown with chromosomal regions syntenous to previously identified photoperiod (Ppd-B1) and vernalisation (Vrn-A1) sensitive loci. Additional QTL associated with time to heading were also identified on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 6D, 7A and 7B. Comparisons between the genetic associations observed under the different growing conditions allowed the majority of these loci to be classified as having either photoperiod-sensitive, vernalisation-sensitive or earliness per se actions. The identification of a photoperiod-sensitive QTL on chromosome 1A provides evidence for a wheat gene possibly homoeologous to Ppd-H2 previously identified on chromosome 1H of barley. The occurrence of a putative major gene for photoperiod sensitivity observed on chromosome 7A is presented. The combined additive effects at these loci accounted for more than half the phenotypic variance in the duration from planting to ear-emergence in this population. The possible role of these loci on the adaptation of wheat in Australia is discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to identify genetic changes in rye seeds induced by natural ageing during long-term storage and consecutive regeneration cycles under gene bank conditions. Genomic DNA from four rye samples varying in their initial viability after one and three cycles of reproduction was analyzed by AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) fingerprinting. Seven EcoRI/MseI primer combinations defined 663 fragments, and seven PstI/MyeI primer combinations defined 551 fragments. The variation in the frequency of the seventy-four EcoRI/MseI bands was statistically significant between samples. These changes could be attributed to genetic changes occurring during storage and regeneration. However, the PstI/MseI fragments appeared to be uninfluenced by seed ageing, regeneration and propagation. A combined Principle Coordinate Analysis revealed differences between samples with different initial viability. We showed that materials with low initial viability differ in their response from highly viable ones, and that the changes exhibited in the former case are preserved through regeneration cycles.

AB Strawbreaker foot rot (SFR) [Pseudocereosporella herpotrichoides (Fron) Deighton] is a disease of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in many wheat growing regions in the world. Resistance to SFR can be conferred by a single dominant gene (Pch1) from Aegilops ventricosa Tausch that was transferred onto chromosome 7D of wheat. 'Madsen', a hexaploid winter bread wheat, carries Pch1 and is highly resistant to SFR. Jointed goatgrass (Ae. cylindrica Host.) is a winter annual grass weed. Wheat and jointed goatgrass have the D genome in common and have been found to hybridize and backcross under field conditions. Since SFR resistance in winter wheat is controlled by Pch1 on the D genome, it is theoretically possible for resistance to be transferred to jointed goatgrass via backcrossing. A SFR resistant jointed goatgrass population would potentially have an ecological advantage in the presence of the disease. To evaluate the likelihood of gene introgression, Madsen, 'Stephens' (a SFR susceptible winter wheat), three jointed goatgrass accessions, and 15 artificially produced backcross progenies (BC2S2) were inoculated with SFR. The percentage of infection in Stephens, the joined goatgrass accessions, and the backcross progenies was 80% or greater except for one BC2S2 progeny that had only 20% infection. Madsen had 0% infection. The presence of Pch1 in the BC2S2 progeny was confirmed using a biochemical marker linked to the resistance gene. These results show that a SFR resistance gene from winter wheat can be transferred to jointed goatgrass.

AB The Green Revolution was the product of alteration in plant architecture and physiological properties through breeding in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), and other crops. The semidwarf plant stature contributed to providing adequate nutrition to the plant for high productivity, without inducing lodging. It also increased the harvest index. Similarly, photoinsensitivity helped to match the crop cultivar to seasons with appropriate moisture availability. The Green Revolution led to increased production through higher productivity and, thereby, conserved arable land and forests. Green Revolution technology, however, was criticized by environmentalists, economists, and social scientists for its deficiencies. Economists stressed that, because market-purchased inputs are needed for output, only resource-rich farmers are able to take advantage of high-yielding cultivars. Environmentalists emphasized that the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the monoculture of a few crop cultivars, will create serious environmental problems, including the breakdown of resistance and the degradation of soil fertility. Social scientists stressed that often women were excluded from technology-based agriculture, leading to their marginalization. The Green Revolution, however, helped many developing countries, including India and China, to achieve a balance between population growth and food production. It contributed to an alignment of population growth to the human capacity to produce the needed food and other agricultural commodities.

AB Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. (2n = 2x = 14, DD), a wild relative of wheat has been considered to be a valuable source of variation for improvement of cultivated wheats. However, undesirable genes can be incorporated into the cultivated varieties from wild relatives. The spontaneous spike shattering caused by the brittle rachis character is of adaptive value in wild grass species, but not in cultivated varieties. The rachis of R-61, which was derived from the cross of T. aestivum cv. Bet Hashita with an accession of Ae. tauschii, was brittle. Using telosomic stocks, the brittle rachis gene Br-61 (tentatively designated) of B-61 was located on the short arm of chromosome 3D and the distance of Br-61 to the centromere was 31.9 cM. The distance of Br-61 from the centromeric marker Xgdm72 was 25.3 cM on the short arm of chromosome 3D. The location of Br-61 was similar to Br (1) whose location was determined by telosomic mapping and microsatellite mapping. Discrepancy of disarticulation type was found between R-61 and Aegilops tauschii suggesting that the recombination around the regions of Br-1 locus and Br-t locus created the wedge type disarticulation of R-61.

AB Comparative genetic analysis has shown that different plant species often share orthologous genes for very similar functions, especially for cereal crops. In this study, we focused on analyzing the utility of EST-SSR markers among monocots in silico and by experiment. Based on 423,611 wheat ESTs, 101,299 were found to express commonly in rice, maize and barley ESTs, which accounted for 23.94% of wheat EST data. 1707 SSR-containing ESTs (SSR-ESTs) were mined from the 101,299 homologous ESTs, which accounted for 8.8% of all the 19,434 wheat EST-SSRs. It showed that the number of homologous SSR-ESTs much less than the homologous ESTs among grasses. The number of conserved ESTs and SSR-ESTs were inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance among species. Although these SSR-ESTs were in high similarity, the number of conserved SSRs between wheat and the other three crops decreased with the increased aligning regions, and only 13 types of SSR motifs in 21 ESTs were obtained by aligning sequences over a stretch of more than 40 bp. The variation at a microsatellite came from not only the differences in the numbers of repeat units and its location shift, but also base mutations flanking microsatellite repeats. From the 428 uni-SSR-ESTs universally in the four cereals, 243 primers were designed and tested in two genotypes of each species. 154 (63.4%) primers produced clear amplicons across the four species, which showed a high efficient transferability of wheat EST-SSR markers to the other three cereal crops.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for grain weight (GW = 1000 grain weight) in common wheat was conducted using a set of 100 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross 'Rye Selection 111 (high GW) x Chinese Spring (low GW)'. The RILs and their two parental genotypes were evaluated for GW in six different environments (three locations x two years). Genotyping of RILs was carried out using 449 (30 SSRs, 299 AFLP and 120 SAMPL) polymorphic markers. Using the genotyping data of RILs, framework linkage maps were prepared for three chromosomes (1A, 2B, 7A), which were earlier identified by us to carry important/major genes for GW following monosomic analysis. QTL analysis for GW was conducted following genome-wide single marker regression analysis (SMA) and composite interval mapping (CIM) using molecular maps for the three chromosomes. Following SMA, 12 markers showed associations with GW, individual markers explaining 6.57% to 10.76% PV (phenotypic variation) for GW in individual environments. The high grain weight parent, Rye Selection111, which is an agronomically superior genotype, contributed favourable alleles for GW at six of the 12 marker loci identified through SMA. The CIM identified two stable and definitive QTLs, one each on chromosome arms 2BS and 7AS, which were also identified through SMA, and a third suggestive QTL on 1AS. These QTLs explained 9.06% to 19.85% PV for GW in different environments. The QTL for GW on 7AS is co-located with a QTL for heading date suggesting the occurrence of a QTL having a positive pleiotropic effect on the two traits. Some of the markers identified during the present study may prove useful for marker-assisted selection, while breeding for high GW in common wheat.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most destructive diseases in wheat. Identification of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) may provide candidate genes for cloning of FHB resistance genes and molecular markers for marker-assisted improvement of wheat FHB resistance. To identify potential RGAs associated with FHB resistance in wheat, 18 primer pairs of RGAs were screened between two parents (Ning7840 and Clark) and seven informative RGA primer combinations were analyzed in their recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Five PCR products amplified from three primer combinations showed significant association with FHB resistance, and their sequences are similar to the gene families of RGAs. Three of them (RGA14-310, RGA16-462, RGA18-356) were putatively assigned to chromosome 1AL and explained 12.73%, 5.57% and 5.9% of the phenotypic variation for FHB response in the F-7 population, and 10.37%, 3.37% and 4.53% in F-10 population, respectively; suggesting that these RGAs may play a role in enhancing FHB resistance in wheat. Analysis of nucleotide sequence motifs demonstrated that all the RGA markers contain a heat shock factor that initiates the production of heat shock proteins. A sequence tagged site (STS) marker (FHBSTS1A-160) was successfully converted from RGA18-356, and validated in fourteen other cultivars. Significant interaction between the quantitative trait locus (QTL) on 1AL and the QTL on 3BS was detected. The marker FHBSTS1A-160 in combination with markers linked to the major QTL on 3BS could be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for enhanced FHB resistance in wheat.

AB The Arachis section is the most important of the nine sections of the genus Arachis because it includes the cultivated peanut, Arachis hypogaea. The genetic improvement of A. hypogaea using wild relatives is at an early stage of development in spite of their potential as sources of genes, including those for disease and pests resistance, that are not found in the A. hypogaea primary gene pool. Section Arachis species germplasm has been collected and maintained in gene banks and its use and effective conservation depends on our knowledge of the genetic variability contained in this material. Microsatellites are routinely used for the analysis of genetic variability because they are highly polymorphic and codominant. The objective of this study was to evaluate the transferability of microsatellite primers and the assay of genetic variability between and within the germplasm of some species of the Arachis section. Fourteen microsatellite loci developed for three different species of Arachis were analyzed and 11 (78%) were found to be polymorphic. All loci had transferability to all the species analyzed. The polymorphic loci were very informative, with expected heterozygosity per locus ranging from 0.70 to 0.94. In general, the germplasm analyzed showed wide genetic variation.

AB Brachypodium. is well suited as a model system for temperate grasses because of its compact genome and a range of biological features. In an effort to develop resources for genome research in this emerging model species, we constructed 2 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries from an inbred diploid Brachypodium distachyon line, Bd21, using restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI. A total of 73 728 clones (36 864 per BAC library) were picked and arrayed in 192 384-well plates. The average insert size for the BamHI and HindIII libraries is estimated to be 100 and 105 kb, respectively, and inserts of chloroplast origin account for 4.4% and 2.4%, respectively. The libraries individually represent 9.4- and 9.9-fold haploid genome equivalents with combined 19.3-fold genome coverage, based on a genome size of 355 Mb reported for the diploid Brachypodium, implying a 99.99% probability that any given specific sequence will be present in each library. Hybridization of the libraries with 8 starch biosynthesis genes was used to empirically evaluate this theoretical genome coverage; the frequency at which these genes were present in the library clones gave an estimated coverage of 11.6- and 19.6-fold genome equivalents. To obtain a first view of the sequence composition of the Brachypodium genome, 2185 BAC end sequences (BES) representing 1.3 Mb of random genomic sequence were compared with the NCBI GenBank database and the GIRI repeat database. Using a cutoff expectation value of E < 10(-10), only 3.3% of the BESs showed similarity to repetitive sequences in the existing database, whereas 40.0% had matches to the sequences in the EST database, suggesting that a considerable portion of the Brachypodium genome is likely transcribed. When the BESs were compared with individual EST databases, more matches hit wheat than maize, although their EST collections are of a similar size, further supporting the close relationship between Brachypodium and the Triticeae. Moreover, 122 BESs have significant matches to wheat ESTs mapped to individual chromosome bin positions. These BACs represent colinear regions containing the mapped wheat ESTs and would be useful in identifying additional markers for specific wheat chromosome regions.

AB The original blue-grained wheat, Blue 58, was a substitution line derived from hybridization between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42, ABD) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum Liu & Wang = Agropyron elongatum, 2n = 10x = 70, StStE(e)E(b)E(x)), in which one pair of 41) chromosomes was replaced by a pair of alien 4Ag chromosomes (unknown group 4 chromosome from A. ponticum). Blue aleurone might be a useful cytological marker in chromosome engineering and wheat breeding. Cytogenetic analysis showed that blue aleurone was controlled by chromosome 4Ag. GISH analysis proved that the 4Ag was a recombination chromosome; its centromeric and pericentromeric regions were from an E-genome chromosome, but the distal regions of its two arms were from an St-genome chromosome. On its short arm, there was a major pAs1 hybridization band, which was very close to the centromere. GISH and FISH analysis in a set of translocation lines with different seed colors revealed that the gene(s) controlling the blue pigment was located on the long arm of 4Ag. It was physically mapped to the 0.71-0.80 regions (distance measured from the centromere of 4Ag). The blue color is a consequence of dosage of this small chromosome region derived from the St genome. We speculate that the blue-grained gene(s) could activate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway of wheat.

AB A mosaic disease caused by Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) is becoming increasingly important, particularly in winter wheat in Europe. As there are currently no effective cultural practices or practical environmentally friendly chemicals for disease control, host plant resistance is an important objective in breeding programs. However, development of resistant cultivars is slow owing to difficulties in germplasm screening for resistance. Therefore, there is a need to identify molecular markers linked to SBCMV-resistance gene(s), so that quick and accurate laboratory-based marker-assisted selection rather than prolonged field-based screens for resistance can be used in developing resistant cultivars. We previously demonstrated that resistance to SBCMV in Triticum aestivum 'Cadenza' is controlled by a single locus. In this work, we used AFLP and microsatellite technology to map this resistance locus, with the proposed name Sbm1, to the distal end of chromosome 5DL. Interestingly, several expressed disease-resistance gene analogues also map to this gene-rich region on 5DL. Closely linked (similar to 17 cM interval) markers, BARC110 and WMC765, RRES01 and BARC144, that flank Sbm1 will be very useful in breeding for selection of germplasm carrying Sbm1.

AB Oncidium is one of the most popular ornamental orchids. However, it is difficult to differentiate one cultivar from another based only on phenotypic traits. As Plant Breeders' Rights evolve, in particular since the advent of essential derivations, the importance of early differentiation of crop cultivars increases. In this report, AFLP markers were used, with 21 primer pair combinations, to fingerprint two cultivars from Oncidium Gower Ramsey hybrids and two cultivars from O. Sweet Sugar hybrids with the restriction endonucleases Eco RI and Mse I. A total of 1,091 AFLP bands were obtained. More polymorphic bands (209) were detected between the two hybrids than between the two cultivars of O. Gower Ramsey (25 bands), or between the two cultivers of O. Sweet Sugar (18). The most significant polymorphic AFLP bands (11) were cloned and sequenced for conversion into 12 sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. These STS markers were then applied to the identification of 49 cultivars from four Oncidium hybrids including O. Gower Ramsey, O. Sweet Sugar, O. Kaizumic Delight and O. Sharry Baby. Three STS markers (P03A, P03B and P10) were successfully identified to differentiate the three hybrids (O. Gower Ramsey, O. Sweet Sugar, and O. Sharry Baby) and three cultivars of O. Sweet Sugar ('Angel', 'Emperor' and 'Million Coin'). In conclusion, STS molecular markers, developed through AFLP fingerprinting, could prove useful to distinguish new cultivars of Oncidium orchid.

AB Eighteen individually housed boars were randomly allocated to one of three dietary treatments, an experimental wheat diet containing 989.4 g kg(-1) of a basal wheat diet, or this experimental wheat diet with 500 g kg(-1) of the basal wheat diet replaced with 500 g kg(-1) of either transgenic or non-transgenic peas. The transgenic peas expressed the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) alpha-amylase inhibitor 1 gene. Diets contained n-hexatriacontane (0.2 g kg(-1)) as an indigestible marker to allow the determination of nutrient digestibility at the terminal ileum. Pigs were offered 1.6 kg day(-1) for 15 days, after which they were anaesthetised, the Heal and faecal digesta collected and the pigs subsequently euthanased. The ileal dry matter and starch digestibilities of the experimental wheat, non-transgenic and transgenic pea diets were 78.3, 74.2 and 45.8% and 95.9, 95.2 and 42.4%, respectively. The apparent nutrient digestibilities of the non-transgenic and transgenic peas were determined by difference. The Real dry matter digestibility was significantly reduced in the transgenic peas compared with the non-transgenic peas (12.7 and 69.9%, respectively; P = 0.006), which was largely due to a reduced starch digestibility. The apparent crude protein digestibilities of the transgenic peas were similar to the non-transgenic, being 79.7 and 78.5%, respectively. The amino acid digestibilities of the transgenic and non-transgenic peas were also similar. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB ALMT1 gene encoding a membrane protein that facilitates an aluminium stimulated malate efflux has been characterised and mapped in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, we have identified molecular markers targeting insertion/deletion (indel) and SSR repeats within intron 3 region of the ALMT1 gene. Both the markers: ALMT1-SSR3a and ALMT1-SSR3b based on repetitive indels, exhibited complete cosegregation with Al tolerance, malate efflux, and a CAPS marker discriminating ALMT1-1 and ALMT1-2 alleles, in a doubled haploid population derived from Diamondbird (Al-tolerant)/Janz (Al-sensitive). A parental screen of 20 diverse wheat genotypes with repetitive indel markers indicated that six allele variants exist at the ALMT1SSR3 locus. Sequence analysis confirmed that these variations were due to indels, copy number of SSR repeats, and base substitution within SSR repeats. The higher level of variation in intron 3 suggests that this genomic region has been constrained by indels, SSR and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Results have proven that repetitive indel markers cosegregating with the Al tolerance locus will be useful for marker assisted selection and population and evolution studies.

AB Fusarium graminearum causes fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat and other cereals. Resistance of wheat to FHB is incomplete and the defence mechanisms involved are poorly understood owing to the complex genome and long life cycle of the host. A robust and reproducible bioassay system was established for the study of interactions between F. graminearum and Arabidopsis by wound inoculation of detached leaves embedded in agar medium. Amendment of the inoculum with deoxynivalenol enhanced symptom development and conidial production. Colonization of leaf tissue was by both inter- and intracellular growth and extensive cell death was observed ahead of advancing hyphae indicating the presence of phytotoxic compounds or host-initiated programmed cell death. Expression of defence response genes associated with jasmonic acid/ethylene and salicylic acid pathways indicated that both pathways were activated in response to F. graminearum with expression of the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathways being more enhanced than that of the salicylic acid pathway, as expected for a necrotrophic pathogen. A large variation in resistance among Arabidopsis ecotypes was revealed. The ecotype Col-0 was significantly more resistant than Ler using both the detached leaf and a detached flower assay. Foliar resistance was shown to be controlled largely by a single genetic factor on chromosome 4 near the RFLP marker O6455. The detached leaf assay described herein provides a means to enable fundamental studies on the defence mechanisms of Arabidopsis in response to F. graminearum.

AB Septoria speckled leaf blotch (SSLB), caused by Septoria passerinii, has emerged as one of the most important foliar diseases of barley in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. To map and tag genes for SSLB resistance, we developed two populations derived from the resistant accessions CIho 4780 and CIho 10644 and the susceptible malting cv. Foster. Segregation analysis of F-2 plants or F-2,F-3 families from the Foster/CIho 4780 and Foster/CIho 10644 populations revealed that a single dominant gene conferred resistance at the seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis identified an amplified fragment length polymorphism marker, E-ACT/M-CAA-170, that co-segregated with the SSLB resistance gene Rsp2 in the Foster/Clho 4780 F-2 population. Southern hybridization analysis with DNA from the wheat/barley addition lines localized E-ACT/M-CAA-170 on the short arm of the barley chromosome 5(1H). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with DNA clones previously mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5(1H) placed Rsp2 at a position flanked by the markers Act8 and ksuD14. A sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (E-ACT/M-CAA-170a) was developed that co-segregated with not only Rsp2 in the Foster/Clho 4780 population but also resistance gene Rsp3 in the Foster/Clho 10644 population. This result indicates that Rsp3 is closely linked to Rsp2 on the short arm of chromosome 5(1H). The utility of SCAR marker E-ACT/M-CAA-170a for selecting Rsp2 in two different breeding populations was validated.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is considered as one of the primary causes of low-rice productivity in acid soils. In the present study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling Al resistance based on relative root elongation (RRE) were dissected using a complete linkage map and a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of Al-tolerant japonica cultivar Asominori (Oryza sativa L.) and Al sensitive indica cultivar IR24 (O. sativa L.). A total of three QTLs (qRRE-1, qRRE-9, and qRRE-11) were detected on chromosomes 1, 9, and 11 with LOD score ranging from 2.64 to 3.60 and the phenotypic variance explained from 13.5 to 17.7%. The Asominori alleles were all associated with Al resistance at all the three QTLs. The existence of these QTLs was confirmed using Asominori chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in IR24 genetic background (IAS). By QTL comparative analysis, the two QTLs (qRRE-1 and qRRE-9) on chromosomes 1 and 9 appeared to be consistent among different rice populations while qRRE-11 was newly detected and syntenic with a major Al resistance gene on chromosome 10 of maize. This region may provide an important case for isolating genes responsible for different mechanisms of Al resistance among different cereals. These results also provide the possibilities of enhancing Al resistance in rice breeding program by marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pyramiding QTLs.

AB Symmetric and asymmetric somatic hybrids were produced via protoplast fusion between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. "Jinan 177" and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). The ryegrass without or with UV irradiation was used as a donor, providing a small amount of chromatin. In these somatic hybrids, most ryegrass chromosomes have been confirmed preferential elimination and the somatic hybrid calli and plants showed wheat-like morphology. Some of the hybrid lines were used for the analysis of distribution and heredity of donor DNA in the hybrid genome and the possibility of establishing a radiation hybrid (RH) panel of the ryegrass in the present experiment. These hybrids, subcultured for two and three years, retained the ryegrass DNA examined by RFLP and GISH analysis, respectively. Distribution of the ryegrass DNA in the wheat genomes of 20 single-cell individuals, randomly selected from hybrid cell lines produced, were analyzed by 21 ryegrass genome specific SSR markers. The average frequencies of molecular marker retention in symmetric hybrid lines (UV 0), as well as asymmetric hybrid lines from UV 30 s and 1 min were 10.88, 15.48 and 33.86, respectively. It was suggested that the UV dose increased the introgression of donor DNA into wheat genome. The ryegrass SSR fragments in most asymmetric hybrid cell lines remained stable over a period of 2 similar to 3 years. This revealed that those asymmetric somatic hybrids are suitable for the introgression of ryegrass DNA into wheat, and for RH panel and RH mapping.

DE EST; SNP; genome-specific primer; wheat dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified ill EST sequences can be used to map expressed genes. Though SNPs are useful markers for genetic mapping, SNP mapping of genes in common wheat is challenging because the genetic complement of wheat consists of three closely related genomes (designated A, B, and D), and most genes are present in triplicate sets. Mapping multi-gene family members is further complicated by the fact that it is difficult to distinguish SNP differences between the various paralogs from those between the different genomes. We have developed a PCR-based method for assigning wheat EST sequences to their proper genetic loci by first identifying and mapping SNPs that distinguish the three genomes. To develop this method, we focused on EST sequences encoding the dimeric (x-amylase inhibitors (WDAI). The WDAI coding regions of hexaploid wheat were aligned. The sequences were classified into three groups based on nucleotide variations. Twenty-two SNPs were identified that distinguish the three groups. Group-specific primers based oil these SNPs were designed to permit selective amplification of each group. The chromosomal location of each group was then determined using Group 3 ditelosomic lines of Chinese Spring. Groups 1 and 2 were assigned to chromosome locations 3DS and 3BS, respectively, whereas no sequence could be assigned to 3AS. A remarkable feature of this method is the ability to discriminate the location of homoeologous multigenes in the three genomes of wheat. This strategy can be useful for assigning unknown wheat EST sequences to specific chromosomes.

AB Microsatellite markers were used to map the major genes Bg (determining black glume colour), Rg1 and Rg3 (red glume), and a locus determining smokey-grey coloured glume to the distal ends of the short arms of the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, proximally (or closely linked) to Xgwm1223 and distal to Xgwm0033. On this basis, we propose that these genes represent a set of homoeoloci, designated Rg-A1, Rg-B1, and Rg-D1. Rg3 and Bg appear to be variant alleles of Rg-A1. Both Rg3 and Bg are closely linked with the major glume pubescence gene Hg. Similarly, the hexaploid wheat smokey-grey glume gene and Rg2 represent alleles at Rg-D1. The microsatellite markers linked to the Rg genes were used to analyse a phenotypically and genotypically characterized set of Siberian spring wheats. A coincidence between the presence of the 264-bp allele of Xgwm0136 and Rg-A1b (Rg3) was observed; so Xgwm0136 can probably be used as a diagnostic marker for this gene.

AB Complementary genes for purple grain colour Pp1, Pp2, Pp3 (now designated Pp1, Pp3b, Pp3a, respectively) were mapped using crosses between purple-grained hexaploid wheats 'Purple Feed' - Pp1Pp1/Pp2Pp2 (Pp1Pp1/Pp3bPp3b), 'Purple' - Pp1Pp1/Pp3Pp3 (Pp1Pp1/Pp3aPp3a) with non-purple-grained cultivars 'Novosibirskaya 67' ('N67') and Saratovskaya29' ('S29'). The genes Pp2 (Pp3b) and Pp3 (Pp3a) were inherited as monofactorial dominant when purple-grained wheats were crossed to 'N67'. Both were mapped in the centromeric region of the chromosome 2A. Therefore, they were suggested being different alleles at the same locus and designated Pp3a and Pp3b. In the crosses between purple-grained wheats and 'S29' a segregation ratio of 9 (purple) to 7 (non purple) was obtained suggesting a complementary interaction of two dominant genes, Pp1 and Pp3. To map Pp1 as a single gene, the influence of the other Pp gene was taken into consideration by determining the Pp3 genotype of the F-2 plants. The gene was mapped on chromosome 7BL, about 24 cM distal to the centromere. The Pp1gene was shown to be non allelic to the Rc-1 (red coleoptile) and Pc (purple culm) genes, contrary to what was previously suggested. The colouration caused by the Pp genes has no effect on pre-harvest sprouting.

AB Azospirillum brasilense 8-I was chromosomally labeled with green fluorescent protein (gfp) genes, using either the native promoterless gfp gene or the mutant gfpmut2 gene under the transcriptional control of the neomycin phosphate transferase (npt2) promoter inserted into Tn5 suicide plasmid vectors. One A. brasilense exconjugant, showing a steady and strong fluorescence following irradiation with 365-nm UV light was characterized in detail. This strain, A. brasilense 8-I-gfp showed increased N-2-fixation of approximately threefold, up to a twofold increase in exopolysaccharide production, and a significant decrease in indole-3-acetic acid and poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate production over the parental strain. Sequence analysis showed that the Tn5 carrying the gfp gene was inserted in the clpX gene encoding a heat-shock protein. This data is consistent with a model in which the observed physiological changes are a consequence of pleiotropic changes that occur as a consequence of impaired heat shock (stress) protein synthesis. In summary, (i) chromosomally labelled Azospirillum brasilense was obtained carrying either native or mutant gfp genes, (ii) Pleiotropic physiological effects were caused by disruption of the clpX gene as the consequence of the insertion, (iii) a new indole-3-acetic acid-attenuated mutant of A. brasilense producing only 0.25% of the indole-3-acetic acid produced by the wild-type is presented.

AB We analyzed host-species specificity of Magnaporthe grisea on rice using 110 F-1 progeny derived from a cross between the Oryza isolate CH87 (pathogenic to rice) and the Digitaria isolate 6023 (pathogenic to crabgrass). To elucidate the genetic mechanisms controlling species specificity in M. grisea, we performed a genetic analysis of species-specific avirulence on this rice population. Avirulent and virulent progeny segregated in a 1:1 ratio on the 2 rice cultivars 'Lijiangxintuanheigu' (LTH) and 'Shin2', suggesting that a single locus, designated PRE1, was involved in the specificity. In a combination between 'Kusabue' and 'Tsuyuake', the segregation of the 4 possible phenotypes of F-1 progeny was significantly different from the expected 3:1:3:1 and instead fit a ratio of 2:0:1:1. This indicated that 2 loci, PRE1 and AVR2, were involved in specific parasitism on rice. These results suggest that the species specificity of M. grisea on rice is governed by species-dependent genetic mechanisms that are similar to the gene-for-gene interactions controlling cultivar specificity. Pathogenicity tests with various plant species revealed that the Digitaria isolate 6023 was exclusively parasitic on crabgrass. Genetic linkage analysis showed that PRE1 was mapped on chromosome 3 with respect to RAPD and SSR markers. RAPD marker S361 was linked to the avirulence gene at a distance of similar to 6.4 cM. Two SSR markers, m677-678 and m77-78, were linked to the PRE1 gene on M. grisea chromosome 3 at distances of 5.9 and 7.1 cM, respectively. Our results will facilitate positional cloning and functional studies of this gene.

AB Linkage maps developed from known-function genes can be valuable in the candidate gene mapping approach. A set of 121 expressed sequence tagged site (E-STS) primer pairs were tested on a framework genetic linkage map of apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) constructed using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. These known-function gene markers, E-STSs, were supplemented by markers for resistance gene analogues (RGAs), designed based on conserved motifs in all characterized resistance genes isolated from plant species. A total of 229 markers, including 46 apple E-STSs, 8 RGAs, 85 SSRs from apple and peach, and 88 RAPDs, were assigned to 17 linkage groups covering 832 cM of the apple genome, based on 52 individuals originating from the cross 'Antonovka debnicka' (Q12-4) x 'Summerred'. Clusters of E-STS and RGA loci were located in linkage groups previously identified to carry resistance genes, some of which confer resistance to apple scab disease caused by Venturia inaequalis (Cke.) Wint.

AB Leaf (brown) and stripe (yellow) rusts, caused by Puccinia triticina and Puccinia striiformis, respectively, are fungal diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) that cause significant yield losses annually in many wheat-growing regions of the world. The objectives of our study were to characterize genetic loci associated with resistance to leaf and stripe rusts using molecular markers in a population derived from a cross between the rust-susceptible cultivar 'Avocet S' and the resistant cultivar 'Pavon76'. Using bulked segregant analysis and partial linkage mapping with AFLPs, SSRs and RFLPs, we identified 6 independent loci that contributed to slow rusting or adult plant resistance (APR) to the 2 rust diseases. Using marker information available from existing linkage maps, we have identified additional markers associated with resistance to these 2 diseases and established several linkage groups in the 'Avocet S' x 'Pavon76' population. The putative loci identified on chromosomes 1BL, 4BL, and 6AL influenced resistance to both stripe and leaf rust. The loci on chromosomes 3BS and 6BL had significant effects only on stripe rust, whereas another locus, characterized by AFLP markers, had minor effects on leaf rust only. Data derived from Interval mapping indicated that the loci identified explained 53% of the total phenotypic variation (R-2) for stripe rust and 57% for leaf rust averaged across 3 sets of field data. A single chromosome recombinant line population segregating for chromosome 1B was used to map Lr46/Yr29 as a single Mendelian locus. Characterization of slow-rusting genes for leaf and stripe rust in improved wheat germplasm would enable wheat breeders to combine these additional loci with known slow-rusting loci to generate wheat cultivars with higher levels of slow-rusting resistance.

AB Molecular genetic marker development in perennial ryegrass has largely been dependent on anonymous sequence variation. The availability of a large-scale EST resource permits the development of functionally-associated genetic markers based on SNP variation in candidate genes. Genic SNP loci and associated haplotypes are suitable for implementation in molecular breeding of outbreeding forage species. Strategies for in vitro SNP discovery through amplicon cloning and sequencing have been designed and implemented. Putative SNPs were identified within and between the parents of the F(1)( NA(6) x AU(6)) genetic mapping family and were validated among progeny individuals. Proof-of-concept for the process was obtained using the drought tolerance-associated LpASRa2 gene. SNP haplotype structures were determined and correlated with predicted amino acid changes. Gene-length LD was evaluated across diverse germplasm collections. A survey of SNP variation across 100 candidate genes revealed a high frequency of SNP incidence ( c. 1 per 54 bp), with similar proportions in exons and introns. A proportion ( c. 50%) of the validated genic SNPs were assigned to the F(1)( NA(6) x AU(6)) genetic map, showing high levels of coincidence with previously mapped RFLP loci. The perennial ryegrass SNP resource will enable genetic map integration, detailed LD studies and selection of superior allele content during varietal development.

AB Potyviruses cause serious yield losses in maize production worldwide. While the maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) predominates in the USA, sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is a major pathogen in China and Germany. In previous studies, inbred FAP1360A revealed complete resistance against both MDMV and SCMV. Two major SCMV resistance genes, Scmv1 and Scmv2, were located on chromosomes 6 and 3, respectively, in populations derived from crosses with the susceptible inbred line F7. For validation of these results obtained in segregating backcross- or F-2:3-populations, near-isogenic lines to F7 have been produced after one initial cross to FAP1360A by repeated backcrossing to F7, phenotypic selection for SCMV resistance, and marker-assisted selection for the Scmv1 and Scmv2 regions from FAP1360A. The near-isogenic line F7R has been studied in detail both at the genomic level and for resistance to different potyviruses. Based on 112 polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers, F7R received genomic segments introgressed from FAP1360A exclusively in the Scmv1 and Scmv2 chromosomal regions. F7R conferred complete resistance to SCMV and MDMV, but also to zea mosaic virus and to systemic infection by wheat streak mosaic virus. FAP1360A, F7, F7R were not systemically infected by high plains virus. Thus, introgression of Scmv1 and Scmv2 from FAP1360A into F7 was sufficient to generate the first potyvirus multiresistant European Flint line reported so far.

AB High water use efficiency or transpiration efficiency (TE) in wheat is a desirable physiological trait for increasing grain yield under water-limited environments. The identification of genes associated with this trait would facilitate the selection for genotypes with higher TE using molecular markers. We performed an expression profiling (microarray) analysis of approximately 16,000 unique wheat ESTs to identify genes that were differentially expressed between wheat progeny lines with contrasting TE levels from a cross between Quarrion (high TE) and Genaro 81 (low TE). We also conducted a second microarray analysis to identify genes responsive to drought stress in wheat leaves. Ninety-three genes that were differentially expressed between high and low TE progeny lines were identified. One fifth of these genes were markedly responsive to drought stress. Several potential growth-related regulatory genes, which were down-regulated by drought, were expressed at a higher level in the high TE lines than the low TE lines and are potentially associated with a biomass production component of the Quarrion-derived high TE trait. Eighteen of the TE differentially expressed genes were further analysed using quantitative RT-PCR on a separate set of plant samples from those used for microarray analysis. The expression levels of 11 of the 18 genes were positively correlated with the high TE trait, measured as carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13). These data indicate that some of these TE differentially expressed genes are candidates for investigating processes that underlie the high TE trait or for use as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for TE.

AB Three novel low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits from cultivated einkorn ( Triticum monococcum L., A(m)A(m), 2n = 2x = 14) were characterized by SDS-PAGE and molecular weights determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. Their coding genes were amplified and cloned with designed AS-PCR primers, revealing three complete gene sequences. All comprised upstream, open reading frame (ORF), downstream and no introns were present. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that all three genes, named as LMW-M1, LMW-M3 and LMW-M5, respectively, belonged to the LMW-i type subunits with the predicted molecular weight between 38.5206 and 38.7028 kDa. They showed high similarity with other LMW-i type genes from hexaploid bread wheats, but also displayed unique features. Particularly, LMW-M5 subunit contained an extra cysteine residue in the C-terminus except for eight conserved cysteines, which resulted from a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the T-C transition, namely arginine -> cysteine substitution at position 242 from the N-terminal end. This is the first report that the LMW-i subunit contained nine cysteines residues that could result in a more highly cross-linked and more elastic glutenin suggesting that LMW-M5 gene may associates with good quality properties. In addition, a total of 25 SNPs and one insertions/deletions (InDels) were detected among three LMW-i genes, which could result in significant functional changes in polymer formation of gluten. It is anticipated that these SNPs could be used as reliable genetic markers during wheat quality improvement. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that LMW-i type genes apparently differed from LMW-m and LMW-s type genes and diverged early from the primitive LMW-GS gene family, at about 12.92 million years ago (MYA) while the differentiation of A(m) and A genomes was estimated at 3.98 MYA.

AB Barley stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei, is one of the most important barley (Hordeum vulgare) diseases in the United States. The disease is best controlled using resistant cultivars. Barley genotype Grannenlose Zweizeilige (GZ) has a recessive gene (rpsGZ) that is effective against all races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei identified so far in the USA. To develop a molecular map for mapping the gene, F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from the Steptoe X GZ cross through single-seed descent. Seedlings of the parents and RILs were evaluated for resistance to races PSH-14 and PSH-54 of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei under controlled greenhouse conditions. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents and 182 F-8 RILs and used for linkage analysis. The resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique was used to identify molecular markers for rpsGZ. A linkage group for the gene was constructed with 12 RGAP markers, of which two markers co-segregated with the resistance locus, and two markers were closely linked to the locus with a genetic distance of 0.9 and 2.0 cM, respectively. These four markers were present only in the susceptible parent. The closest marker to the resistance allele was 11.7 cM away. Analyses of two sets of barley chromosome addition lines of wheat with the two RGAP markers that were cosegregating with the susceptibility allele showed that rpsGZ and the markers were located on the long arm of barley chromosome 4H. Further, tests with four simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers confirmed the chromosomal location of the rpsGZ gene and also integrated the RGAP markers into the known SSR-based linkage map of barley. The closest SSR marker EBmac0679 had a genetic distance of 7.5 cM with the gene in the integrated linkage map constructed with the 12 RGAP markers and 4 SSR markers. The information on chromosomal location and molecular markers for rpsGZ should be useful for incorporating this gene into commercial cultivars and combining it with other resistance genes for durable resistance.

AB Isolation of mitotic chromosomes using flow cytometry is an attractive way to dissect nuclear genomes into their individual chromosomal components or portions of them. This approach is especially useful in plants with complex genomes, where it offers a targeted and hence economical approach to genome analysis and gene cloning. In several plant species, DNA of flow-sorted chromosomes has been used for isolation of molecular markers from specific genome regions, for physical mapping using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), for integration of genetic and physical maps and for construction of chromosome-specific DNA libraries, including those cloned in bacterial artificial chromosome vectors. Until now, chromosome analysis and sorting using flow cytometry (flow cytogenetics) has found little application in barley (2n = 14, 1C similar to 5, 100 Mbp) because of the impossibility of discriminating and sorting individual chromosomes, except for the smallest chromosome 1H and some translocation chromosomes with DNA content significantly different from the remaining chromosomes. In this work, we demonstrate that wheat-barley ditelosomic addition lines can be used to sort any arm of barley chromosomes 2H-7H. Thus, the barley genome can be dissected into fractions representing only about 6-12% of the total genome. This advance makes the flow cytogenetics an attractive tool, which may greatly facilitate genome analysis and gene cloning in barley.

AB Development of high-yielding wheat varieties with good end-use quality has always been a major concern for wheat breeders. To genetically dissect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield-related traits such as grain yield, plant height, maturity, lodging, test weight and thousand-grain weight, and for quality traits such as grain and flour protein content, gluten strength as evaluated by mixograph and SDS sedimentation volume, an F-1-derived doubled haploid (DH) population of 185 individuals was developed from a cross between a Canadian wheat variety "AC Karma" and a breeding line 87E03-S2B1. A genetic map was constructed based on 167 marker loci, consisting of 160 microsatellite loci, three HMW glutenin subunit loci: Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1, and four STS-PCR markers. Data for investigated traits were collected from three to four environments in Manitoba, Canada. QTL analyses were performed using composite interval mapping. A total of 50 QTLs were detected, 24 for agronomic traits and 26 for quality-related traits. Many QTLs for correlated traits were mapped in the same genomic regions forming QTL clusters. The largest QTL clusters, consisting of up to nine QTLs, were found on chromosomes 1D and 4D. HMW glutenin subunits at Glu-1 loci had the largest effect on breadmaking quality; however, other genomic regions also contributed genetically to breadmaking quality. QTLs detected in the present study are compared with other QTL analyses in wheat.

AB To enhance fungal disease resistance, wheat plants (cv. Bobwhite) were engineered to constitutively express the potent antimicrobial protein Ace-AMP1 from Allium cepa, driven by a maize ubiquitin promoter along with its first intron. The bar gene was used for selection of putative transformants on medium containing phosphinothricin (PPT). Transgene inheritance, integration and stability of expression were confirmed over two generations by PCR, Southern, northern and western blot analyses, respectively. The levels of Ace-AMP1 in different transgenic lines correlated with the transcript levels of the transgene. Up to 50% increase in resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici was detected in detached leaf assays. In ears of transgenic wheat inoculated with Neovossia indica, Ace-AMP1 intensified expression of defense-related genes. Elevated levels of salicylic acid and of transcripts of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), glucanase (PR2) and chitinase (PR3) in the transgenic plants indicated manifestation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR).

AB The genomes of modem cultivars; have been painstakingly selected for the presence of favorable alleles at multiple loci, which interact to produce superior phenotypes. Genetic transformation provides a tool to introduce new genes without altering the original gene combinations. However, the random genetic and epigenctic changes sometimes generated by the transformation process have been associated with losses in agronomic performance. The agronomic performance of 50 transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines containing additional copies of native or modified high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes and the selectable marker bar, their untransformed parent 'Bobwhite', four lines containing only bar, and 10 null segregant lines were assessed in small plot trials over 2 yr and three locations. Most of the transgenic lines did not show significant changes in performance relative to Bobwhite, although the transgenic lines as a group tended toward lower performance. Null-segregant and bar-only lines performed similarly to Bobwhite. No relationship could be established between performance and particular transgenes or their expression levels. Despite the overall lower performance of the transgenic lines, many with agronomic performance equivalent to Bobwhite were identified. These findings suggest that extant techniques for genetic engineering of wheat are capable of producing agronomically competitive lines for use as cultivars or parents in breeding programs.

AB Triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) is becoming increasingly important in agriculture and understanding its genetic diversity is essential for its continued improvement. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are highly polymorphic and widely used for genetic diversity studies. Previous genetic diversity studies using SSRs have focused on the European winter triticale gene pool. Our objective was to investigate the genetic diversity and relationships of 80 hexaploid triticale accessions representing a more global gene pool using 43 wheat (Triticum spp.) and 14 rye (Secale cereale L.) SSR markers. Two hundred forty-one alleles from 57 markers were detected with an average of 4.2 alleles per locus (ranged from 2 to 11 alleles per locus). The average gene diversity was 0.54 with a range of 0.07 to 0.86. Cluster analysis grouped the 80 accessions into five clusters that were generally consistent with the available pedigree information, country of origin, growth habit, and release year. Every larger cluster, however, included lines with unrelated pedigrees, different countries of origin, growth habit, and release year, which most likely is due to germplasm exchange among breeding programs. Genetic diversity estimates of the accessions evaluated with markers from different sources were similar (0.55 and 0.53 for wheat and rye, respectively), indicating that the wheat and rye markers detected similar genetic variability in the wheat and rye genomes of triticale.

AB Wheat, Triticum aestivum L., genotypes with pith-filled, or solid, stems impede the development of the wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus N., and thus provide a measure of control. A high degree of solidness confers the greatest level of resistance to the sawfly. A previous study allowed identification of a major gene on chromosome 3B of wheat that controlled 75% of the variation for solidness in a hollow-stemmed by solid-stemmed cross. Stems of lines containing the allele for solidness often were of an intermediate solidness that would not confer sufficient resistance to the sawfly. To identify secondary genes, we conducted a cross between a solid-stemmed line and a tine with intermediate solidness. A set of 94 recombinant inbred lines were analyzed for stem solidness and agronomic traits in four environments. Bulk segregant analysis was used to screen 149 polymorphic microsatellite markers. A locus on chromosome 3D, designated Qss.msub-3DL, was identified that controlled 31% of the variation for solidness in this cross. No negative correlation was observed with yield in any environment. Selection for the solid stem alleles on chromosomes 3B and 3D using marker-assisted selection will be useful for rapid development of new solid-stemmed genotypes.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for Al tolerance was performed in rice using a mapping population of 98 BC1F10 lines (backcross inbred lines: BILs), derived from a cross of Al-tolerant cultivar of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and Al-sensitive cultivar (cv. Kasalath). Three characters related to Al tolerance, including root elongation under non-stress conditions (CRE), root elongation under Al stress (SRE) and the relative root elongation (RRE) under Al stress versus non-stress conditions, were evaluated for the BILs and the parents at seedling stage. A total of seven QTLs for the three traits were identified. Among them, three putative QTLs for CRE (qCRE-6, qCRE-8 and qCRE-9) were mapped on chromosomes 6, 8 and 9, respectively. One QTL for SRE (qSRE-4) was identified on chromosome 4. Three QTLs (qRRE-5, qRRE-9 and qRRE-10) for RRE were detected on chromosomes 5, 9, 10 and accounted for 9.7-11.8% of total phenotypic variation. Interestingly, the QTL qRRE-5 appears to be syntenic with the genomic region carrying a major Al tolerance gene on chromosome 6 of maize. Another QTL, qRRE-9, appears to be similar among different rice populations, while qRRE-10 is unique in the BIL population. The common QTLs for CRE and RRE indicate that candidate genes conferring Al tolerance in the rice chromosome 9 may be associated with root growth rates. The existence of QTLs for Al tolerance was confirmed in substitution lines for corresponding chromosomal segments. These results also provide the possibilities of enhancing Al tolerance in rice through using marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pyramiding QTLs.

AB Aegilops umbellulata acc. Y39 and Triticum carthlicum acc. PS5, immune to many powdery mildew isolates, were crossed to make an amphidiploid line Am9. The powdery mildew resistance of Am9 was transferred to common wheat cultivar Laizhou953 by crossing and backcrossing. In this study, the origin of powdery mildew resistance in a BC3F4:5 population derived from a cross of Am9 and Laizhou953 was identified. Microsatellite markers analysis showed that markers Xgwm257, Xgwm296, and Xgwm319, co-segregated with the powdery mildew resistance, whereas markers Xgwm210, Xgwm388/140, Xgwm388/170 and Xgwm526 were related to susceptibility and linked to resistance in repulsion. Of three markers related to resistance, Xgwm257 and Xgwm319 were codominant, whereas Xgwm296 was dominant. All three markers were Ae. umbellulata-specific indicating that resistance in the test population originated from Ae. umbellulata acc. Y39. The chromosome location and mapping of these linked microsatellite markers, the chromosome numbers of derived BC3F4:6 families, and chromosome pairing in F-1 plants from a cross of a homozygous resistant BC3F4:5 plant and Laizhou953, showed that wheat chromosome 2B was substituted by Ae. umbellulata chromosome 2U. This is the first gene conferring powdery mildew resistance transferred to wheat from Ae. umbellulata, and it should be a novel resistance gene to powdery mildew. It was temporarily designated PmY39.

AB An Agropyron elongatum-derived leaf rust resistance gene Lr24 located on chromosome 3DL of wheat was tagged with six random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers which co-segregated with the gene. The markers were identified in homozygous resistant F-2 plants taken from a population segregating for leaf rust resistance generated from a cross between two near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing only for Lr24. Phenotyping was done by inoculating the plants with pathotype 77-5 of Puccinia triticina. To enable gene-specific selection, three RAPD markers (S1302(609), S1326(615) and OPAB-1(388)) were successfully converted to polymorphic sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, amplifying only the critical DNA fragments co-segregating with Lr24. The SCAR markers were validated for specificity to the gene Lr24 in wheat NILs possessing Lr24 in 10 additional genetic backgrounds including the Thatcher NIL, but not to 43 Thatcher NILs possessing designated leaf rust resistance genes other than Lr24. This indicated the potential usefulness of these SCAR markers in marker assisted selection (MAS) and for pyramiding leaf rust resistance genes in wheat.

AB The physical length of the rye segment of a 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation derived from the Cornell Wheat Selection 82a1-2-4-7 in a Triticum aestivum 'Chinese Spring' background was measured using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and found to be 16% of the long arm. The size of this translocation was similar to previously published GISH measurements of another 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation in a Triticum aestivum 'Viking' wheat background. Molecular maps of both 4BS.4BL-5RL translocations for 2 different wheat backgrounds were developed using RFLP analysis. The locations of the translocation breakpoints of the 2 4BS.4BL-5RL translocations were similar even though they arose in different populations. This suggests a unique property of the region at or near the translocation breakpoint that could be associated with their similarity and spontaneous formation. These segments of rye chromosome 5 also contain a gene for copper efficiency that improves the wheat's ability to cope with low-copper soils. Genetic markers in these maps can also be used to screen for copper efficiency in bread wheat lines derived from the Cornell Wheat Selection 82a1 2-4-7.

AB Net blotch, caused by Pyrenophora teres, is one of the most economically important diseases of barley worldwide. Here, we used a barley doubled-haploid population derived from the lines SM89010 and Q21861 to identify major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seedling resistance to P. teres f. teres (net-type net blotch (NTNB)) and P. teres f. maculata (spot-type net blotch (STNB)). A map consisting of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers was used to identify chromosome locations of resistance loci. Major QTLs for NTNB and STNB resistance were located on chromosomes 6H and 4H, respectively. The 6H locus (NTNB) accounted for as much as 89% of the disease variation, whereas the 4H locus (STNB resistance) accounted for 64%. The markers closely linked to the resistance gene loci will be useful for marker-assisted selection.

AB Bread wheat chromosome 3A has been shown to contain genes/QTLs controlling grain yield and other agronomic traits. The objectives of this study were to generate high-density physical and genetic-linkage maps of wheat homoeologous group 3 chromosomes and reveal the physical locations of genes/QTLs controlling yield and its component traits, as well as agronomic traits, to obtain a precise estimate of recombination for the corresponding regions and to enrich the QTL-containing regions with markers. Physical mapping was accomplished by 179 DNA markers mostly representing expressed genes using 41 single-break deletion lines. Polymorphism survey of cultivars Cheyenne (CNN) and Wichita (WI), and a substitution line of CNN carrying chromosome 3A from WI [CNN(WI3A)], with 142 RFLP probes and 55 SSR markers revealed that the extent of polymorphism is different among various group 3 chromosomal regions as well as among the homoeologs. A genetic-linkage map for chromosome 3A was developed by mapping 17 QTLs for seven agronomic traits relative to 26 RFLP and 15 SSR chromosome 3A-specific markers on 95 single-chromo some recombinant inbred lines. Comparison of the physical maps with the 3A genetic-linkage map localized the QTLs to gene-containing regions and accounted for only about 36% of the chromosome. Two chromosomal regions containing 9 of the 17 QTLs encompassed less than 10% of chromosome 3A but accounted for almost all of the arm recombination. To identify rice chromosomal regions corresponding to the particular QTL-containing wheat regions, 650 physically mapped wheat group 3 sequences were compared with rice genomic sequences. At an E value of E <= 10(-5), 82% of the wheat group 3 sequences identified rice homologs, of which 54% were on rice chromosome 1. The rice chromosome I region collinear with the two wheat regions that contained 9 QTLs was about 6.5 Mb. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) represent one of the largest groups of systemic fungicides that have been used to control agriculturally important fungal pathogens. Knowledge regarding the evolution of fungicide resistance in agricultural ecosystems is fragmentary and a better understanding of the processes driving the development of DMI resistance in populations of fungal pathogens is needed by plant pathologists and the agrochemical industry. We considered some of these processes using approaches based on molecular population and quantitative genetics. Five Mycosphaerella graminicola populations sampled from unsprayed wheat fields on four continents were assayed for eight restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and their level of tolerance to cyproconazole. DMI fungicides such as cyproconazole inhibit the enzyme eburicol 14-alpha-demethylase. The gene encoding this target, CYP51, was sequenced for all isolates. We found unimodal, continuous variations in cyproconazole tolerance among the M. graminicola isolates sampled from individual fields, consistent with a polygenic mode of inheritance. We also found that population differentiation for cyproconazole tolerance (Q(ST)) among the five M. graminicola populations was significantly higher than the corresponding population differentiation for neutral RFLP markers (G(ST)), suggesting that selection for cyproconazole tolerance in the Swiss population has already led to local adaptation that can be seen even in an unsprayed population. The Swiss population displayed the highest level of tolerance to cyproconazole, in addition to a lower than expected quantitative variation in fungicide tolerance and a skewed distribution, indicating that selection had increased the overall tolerance of this population. Further analysis with DNA sequencing showed that the population from Switzerland was dominated by isolates with several point mutations and a 6-bp deletion in CYP51. This deletion and one of the point mutations were previously related to increased resistance in field isolates. The fungal population from Oregon sampled from an unsprayed resistant host cultivar displayed the same gene diversity in RFLP loci but higher cyproconazole tolerance and quantitative variation in tolerance than the fungal population from the same field sampled from an unsprayed susceptible host cultivar.

AB A selectable marker gene conferring resistance to bialaphos (BI) was introduced into rice blast isolate Y90-71BI and another conferring resistance to blasticidin S (BS) into isolate 3514-R-2BS of Magnaporthe oryzae to demonstrate exchange of DNA. Colonies obtained from cocultures of these two isolates were resistant to both BI and BS and had both resistance genes as shown by Southern blot analysis of their genomic DNA. Conidia from these BI-BS-resistant isolates had only one nucleus per cell after staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Using flow cytometry, however, these BI-BS-resistant isolates were found to be haploid. Segregation of BI-BS-resistant isolates for pathogenicity (avirulence to virulence) on rice line K59-1 was consistent with a 1:1 ratio, as was segregation for mating type. These BI-BS-resistant isolates were thus apparently derived from parasexual exchange of DNA and the segregation of pathogenicity and of mating type of the parasexual recombinants might correspond to that of the progeny of the offspring of the sexual cross.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis sp. tritici, is a major disease to wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Use of adult-plant resistance (APR) is an effective method to develop wheat cultivars with durable resistance to powdery mildew. In the present study, 432 molecular markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for APR to powdery mildew in a doubled haploid (DH) population with 107 lines derived from the cross Fukuho-komugi x Oligoculm. Field trials were conducted in Beijing and Anyang. China during 2003-2004 and 20042005 cropping seasons, respectively. The DH lines were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Artificial inoculation was carried out in Beijing with highly virulent isolate E20 of B. graminis f sp. tritici and the powdery mildew severity on penultimate leaf was evaluated four times, and the maximum disease severity (MDS) on penultimate leaf was investigated in Anyang under natural inoculation in May 2004 and 2005. The heritability of resistance to powdery mildew for MDS in 2 years and two locations ranged from 0.82 to 0.93, while the heritability for area under the disease progress curve was between 0.84 and 0.91. With the method of composite interval mapping, four QTL for APR to powdery mildew were detected on chromosomes 1 AS, 2BL, 4BL, and 7DS, explaining 5.7 to 26.6% of the phenotypic variance. Three QTL on chromosomes 1AS, 2BL, and 7DS were derived from the female, Fukuho-kotnugi, while the one on chromosome 4BL was from the male, Oligoculm. The QTL on chromosome 1 AS showed high genetic effect on powdery mildew resistance, accounting for 19.5 to 26.6% of phenotypic variance across two environments. The QTL on 7DS associated with the locus Lr34/Yr18, flanked by microsatellite Xgwm295.1 and Ltn (leaf tip necrosis). These results will benefit for improving powdery mildew resistance in wheat breeding programs.

ID BREAD WHEAT; EXPRESSION; QUALITY; GENE
AB Detailed global gene expression profiles have been obtained for a series of transgenic and conventionally bred wheat lines expressing additional genes encoding HMW (high molecular weight) subunits of glutenin, a group of endosperm-specific seed storage proteins known to determine dough strength and therefore bread-making quality. Differences in endosperm and leaf transcriptome profiles between untransformed and derived transgenic lines were consistently extremely small, when analysing plants containing either transgenes only, or also marker genes. Differences observed in gene expression in the endosperm between conventionally bred material were much larger in comparison to differences between transgenic and untransformed lines exhibiting the same complements of gluten subunits. These results suggest that the presence of the transgenes did not significantly alter gene expression and that, at this level of investigation, transgenic plants could be considered substantially equivalent to untransformed parental lines.

AB Previous studies indicated that differential gene expression between hybrids and their parents is responsible for the heterosis. In this paper, we report genome-wide gene expression analysis in roots of a highly heterotic inter-specific hybrid 3338/2463 and its parental inbreds using Barley GeneChip. A total of 1187 genes displayed difference in gene expressions between hybrid 3338/2463 and its parents, and they can be clustered into eight differential expression patterns. Further analysis revealed that among these 1187 genes, 975 genes showed high sequence similarity to the GenBank entries, and represented diverse functional categories, such as metabolism, cell growth and maintenance, signal transduction, response to stress, transcription regulation and others. Fourteen genes were selected for RT-PCR analysis and expression patterns of 9 (64.29%) genes were confirmed. Remarkably, 380 differentially expressed genes could be mapped on the Chinese Spring deletion bins, and with the number of genes in seven homoeologous groups being 158, 148, 121, 140, 132, 94 and 127 respectively. It is concluded that a combination of systematic identification of differentially expressed genes with comparative mapping would provide further insight into understanding of molecular basis of heterosis.

AB A set of 111,090 barley expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was searched for the presence of microsatellite motifs [simple sequence repeat (SSRs)] and yielded 2,823 non-redundant SSR-containing ESTs (SSR-ESTs). From this, a set of 754 primer pairs was designed of which 525 primer pairs yielded an amplicon and as a result, 185 EST-derived microsatellite loci (EST-SSRs) were placed onto a genetic map of barley. The markers show a uniform distribution along all seven linkage groups ranging from 21 (7H) to 35 (3H) markers. Polymorphism information content values ranged from of 0.24 to 0.78 (average 0.48). To further investigate the physical distribution of the EST-SSRs in the barley genome, a bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) library was screened. Out of 129 markers tested, BAC addresses were obtained for 127 EST-SSR markers. Twenty-seven BACs, forming eight contigs, were hit by two or three EST-SSRs each. This unexpectedly high incidence of EST-SSRs physically linked at the sub-megabase level provides additional evidence of an uneven distribution of genes and the segmentation of the barley genome in gene-rich and gene-poor regions.

AB This study describes the development of a PCR marker to detect the beta-amylase-R1 gene of rye. It provides an easy and rapid means for the identification of plants containing the beta-amylase-R1. Because rye chromosome segments do not normally recombine with wheat chromosomes, this marker provides a means for tracking all linked genes on that alien 5RL chromosome segment. Reaction conditions were optimised for an annealing temperature of 60 degrees C for a high stringency. The reaction was also optimised for low reaction volumes reducing the cost of the reagents required for the reaction. This PCR test can be used in breeding or mapping programs for the rapid screening of progeny containing translocations of 5RL and hence select for the copper efficiency trait of rye.

AB The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on 3BS from Sumai 3 and its derivatives has been used as a major source of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) worldwide, but resistance genes from other sources are necessary to avoid complete dependence on a single source of resistance. Fifty-nine Asian wheat landraces and cultivars differing in the levels of FHB resistance were evaluated for type II FHB resistance and for genetic diversity on the basis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genetic relationships among these wheat accessions estimated by cluster analysis of molecular marker data were consistent with their geographic distribution and pedigrees. Chinese resistant landraces had broader genetic diversity than that of accessions from southwestern Japan. The haplotype pattern of the SSR markers that linked to FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 3BS, 5AS and 6BS of Sumai 3 suggested that only a few lines derived from Sumai 3 may carry all the putative QTLs from Sumai 3. About half of the accessions might have one or two FHB resistance QTLs from Sumai 3. Some accessions with a high level of resistance, may carry different FHB resistance loci or alleles from those in Sumai 3, and are worth further investigation. SSR data also clearly suggested that FHB resistance QTLs on 3BS, 5AS, and 6BS of Sumai 3 were derived from Chinese landrace Taiwan Xiaomai.

AB Leaf rust resistance gene Lr47 is located within a interstitial segment of Triticum speltoides Taush. 7S chromosome translocated to the short arm of chromosome 7A of bread wheat. This gene is resistant against currently predominant races of leaf rust from Argentina. The objectives of this study were to identify microsatellites linked to this source of resistance as a potential tool to introgress this source of resistance. Isogenic lines with and without Lr47 developed from 10 cultivars/breeding lines as well as 10 microsatellites previously mapped in 7AS chromosome were used in this study. Microsatellite gwm 60 was the only marker that co-segregated completely linked to Lr47. These data indicate that gwm 60 could be a valuable marker to introgress Lr47 in wheat germplasm.

AB The antibiotic 2,4-diacetyphloroglucinol is a major determinant in the biocontrol of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria associated with crops of agronomic relevance. The phlD gene is a useful marker of genetic and phenotypic diversity of 2,4-DAPG-producing rhizobacteria. A two-step amplification procedure was developed in order to assess directly the presence of phlD in environmental DNA, avoiding the tedious procedure of phlD-positive strain screening and isolation. We found a predominance of one or two phlD alleles in wheat fields cultivated in rice-wheat rotations for twenty years, suggesting that continuous rice-wheat cropping would lead to an enrichment of particular phlD genotypes. We also recovered new sequences with no close relative among known phlD sequences, indicating that part of the phlD allelic diversity might have been missed using standard media culture conditions.

AB In order to improve the absorption of nanoparticles in the brain following nasal administration, a novel protocol to conjugate biorecognitive ligands-lectins to the surface of poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) nanoparticles was established in the study. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), specifically binding to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and sialic acid, both of which were abundantly observed in the nasal cavity, was selected as a model lectin. The WGA-conjugated nanoparticles were prepared by incorporating maleimide in the PLA-PEG molecular and taking advantage of its thief group binding reactivity to conjugate with 2-iminothialane thiolated WGA. Coupling of WGA with the PEG-PLA nanoparticles was confirmed by the existence of gold-labeled WGA-NP under TEM. The retention of biorecognitive activity of WGA after the covalent coupling procedure was confirmed by haemagglutination test. The resulting nanoparticles presented negligible nasal ciliatoxicity and the brain uptake of a fluorescent marker-coumarin carried by WGA functionized nanoparticles was about 2 folds in different brain tissues compared with that of coumarin incorporated in the unmodified ones. Thus, the technique offered a novel effective noninvasive system for brain drug delivery, especially for brain protein and gene delivery. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic transformation is vital to the transfer of novel genes into crop plants as well as to the emerging area of functional genomics. However, the successful genetic transformation of wheat still remains time consuming and genotype dependent. This paper updates the progress made in last 3 years towards developing a robust genetic transformation system for wheat. Agrobacterium-mediated wheat transformation offers advantages such as single-copy gene insertion, minimal rearrangement of DNA, low cost and comparatively high efficiency. The reported recent developments in wheat transformation will lead to increased efficiency of wheat breeding programs. The most promising recent progress is in the development of drought-tolerant wheat, since water stress continues to be a major limiting factor hindering world wheat productivity under adverse hot and dry weather conditions.

AB Linked leaf and stripe rust resistance genes introgressed into hexaploid wheat from Aegilops sharonensis provided protection in the seedling stage to a wide range of pathotypes of the two diseases. Monosomic and telosomic analyses showed that the resistance genes occur on wheat chromosome 6A. This result could be confirmed making use of mapped chromosome 6A microsatellite markers. The introgressed chromatin appeared to involve the proximal part of 6AL and the complete 6AS arm and it was thus not possible to deduce the chromosome arm harbouring the resistance genes. The resistance showed non-Mendelian transmission. The genetic background of a heterozygote interacted with the introgressed region to result in either preferential or impaired female transmission. Male transmission appeared to be affected in a different way from female transmission and was exclusive in the genetic background studied. Symbols Lr56 and Yr38 are proposed to designate the respective genes of which line 0352-4 is the appropriate source material.

A total of 585 isolates representing 10 field populations were sampled from Iran, Argentina and Australia. The genetic structure of M. graminicola populations from Iran and Argentina is described for the first time. Results were compared to previously investigated populations from Israel, Uruguay and Australia. Populations from Iran exhibited high clonality and low gene diversity, suggesting an inoculation event. Populations from uninoculated fields in Argentina had gene and genotype diversities similar to previously described European and North American populations. Genotype diversity was high for populations from Australia and tests for multilocus associations were consistent with sexual recombination in these populations. Gene diversity was low and fixed alleles were found for several loci. These findings are consistent with a relatively small founding population for Australia. These 10 new populations were integrated into a genetic distance comparison with 13 global populations that were characterized earlier.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease in the wheat growing regions of the world. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 3B controls much of the variation for resistance. The cloning of candidate disease-resistance genes for FHB QTLs on chromosome 3B can provide further elucidation of the mechanisms that control resistance. However, rearrangements and divergence during plant genome evolution often hampers the identification of sequences with similarity to known disease-resistance genes. This study focuses on the use of wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that map to the region on chromosome 3B containing the QTL for FHB resistance and low-stringency BLAST searching to identify sequences with similarity to known disease-resistance genes. One EST rich with leucine repeats and low similarity to a protein kinase domain of the barley Rpg1 gene was identified. Genetic mapping using a Ning894037 x Alondra recombinant inbred (RI) population showed that this EST mapped to the QTL on the short arm of chromosome 3B and may represent a portion of a newly diverged gene contributing to FHB resistance. The EST is a new marker suitable for marker-assisted selection and provides a starting point to begin map-based cloning for chromosome walking and investigate new diverged genes at this locus.

AB To investigate the mechanism of resistance to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) powdery mildew, suppression subtractive hybridization was conducted between an isogenic resistant line carrying Pm21 and its recurrent parent Yangmai 5 to isolate the resistance relative genes. A cDNA fragment specifically expressed in the resistant line was obtained and its full length was cloned by in silico cloning and RT-PCR. This gene encoded a deduced protein of 219 amino acids with a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif, often found in plant resistance genes, and was designated as Ta-LRR2. Ta-LRR2 had an increased expression level in the resistant line after inoculation with Erysiphe graminis DC. f. sp. tritici Marchal. PCR analysis with different cytogenetic stocks suggested that Ta-LRR2 was specifically associated with chromosome arms 6VS and 6AS. Linkage analysis further showed that Ta-LRR2 could be used as a resistance gene analog polymorphism marker of Pm21 for marker-assisted selection in germplasm enhancement and breeding practice. Moreover, how to isolate Pm21 based on the information obtained for Ta-LRR2 is discussed.

AB Invertases are key enzymes in carbon partitioning in higher plants. They gain additional importance in the distribution of carbohydrates in the event of wounding or pathogen attack. Although many researchers have found an increase in invertase activity upon infection, only a few studies were able to determine whether the source of this activity was host or parasite. This article analyzes the role of invertases involved in the biotrophic interaction of the rust fungus Uromyces fabae and its host plant, Vicia faba. We have identified a fungal gene, Uf-INV1, with homology to invertases and assessed its contribution to pathogenesis. Expression analysis indicated that transcription began upon penetration of the fungus into the leaf, with high expression levels in haustoria. Heterologous expression of Uf-INV1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris allowed a biochemical characterization of the enzymatic activity associated with the secreted gene product INV1p. Expression analysis of the known vacuolar and cell-wall-bound invertase isoforms of V faba indicated a decrease in the expression of a vacuolar invertase, whereas one cell-wall-associated invertase exhibited increased expression. These changes were not confined to the infected tissue, and effects also were observed in remote plant organs, such as roots. These findings hint at systemic effects of pathogen infection. Our results support the hypothesis that pathogen infection establishes new sinks which compete with physiological sink organs.

AB The 1BL.1RS translocation has been widely used in wheat breeding programmes throughout the world. Unfortunately, this translocation has frequently resulted in unsatisfactory grain processing quality. Two primer combinations derived from the published sequence of a omega-secalin gene on 1RS gave polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments 0.4 and 1.1 kb in size. Both fragments can be used to quickly detect 1BL.1RS translocations. By combining the PCR assay resulting in the 1.1-kb fragment from 1RS and a PCR assay resulting in a 0.6-kb fragment from the Glu-B3 gene on 1BS, plants homozygous for the 1BL 1RS could clearly be distinguished from the heterozygous ones. This codominant marker was successfully applied to genotype a segregating F-2 population and a local cultivar collection.

AB Brittle rachis is an important trait to elucidate the domestication process in barley. Brittle rachis in wild barley (Hordeum vulgore ssp. spontaneum (C. Koch.) Thell) is controlled by two dominant complementary genes, Btr1 and Btr2. Cultivated barley (H. vulgare, L. ssp. vulgare) lost the brittle rachis character during domestication as a result of mutation at the Btr1 or Btr2 locus. In this study, a high-resolution map of the btr1 locus was constructed using an F-2 population of cultivar (cv. 'Kanto Nakate Gold') x wild barley (line OUH602). We cloned and sequenced 26 AFLP markers linked with the btr1 and btr2 loci. Ten converted STS markers were located on the short arm of chromosome 3H only, and at least 9 of the 10 STS markers were allelic with their original AFLPs. Efficient conversion of co-dominant STS markers using BAC clones was successful. No suppression of recombination was observed in the btr1 region even though wild barley was used as one of the parents. Initial results of BAC screening confirmed the resolution power of the developed high resolution map. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The moss Physcomitrella patens is an emerging model in comparative plant science. At present, the Physcomitrella genome is sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute (USA). In this study we present our results on the development of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellite markers for Physcomitrella patens, their classification and applicability as genetic markers on the intra-as well as on the interspecies level. We experienced severe restrictions to compare our results on Physcomitrella with earlier studies for other plant species due to varying microsatellite search criteria and a limited selection of analysed species. As a consequence, we performed a side by side analysis of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellites among 24 plant species covering a broad phylogenetic range and present our results on the observed frequencies.
   Results: We identified 3,723 microsatellites using the software MISA in a non-redundant Physcomitrella expressed sequence tag database comprising more than 37 megabases of nucleotide information. For 2,951 microsatellites appendant primer sequences have been derived. PCR of 376 microsatellites yielded 88% successful amplicons and over 30% polymorphisms between two Physcomitrella accessions. The polymorphism information content of 64 microsatellites based on 21 different Physcomitrella accessions was comparably high with a mean of 0.47 +/- 0.17. Of the 64 Physcomitrella microsatellite markers, 34% respectively 79.7% revealed cross-species applicability in two closely related moss species.
   In our survey of two green algae, two mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo tree, two conifers, ten dicots and five monocots we detected an up to sevenfold variation in the overall frequency with a minimum of 37 up to maximal 258 microsatellites per megabase and a high variability among the different microsatellite class and motif frequencies. Numerous species-specific microsatellite frequencies became evident and several deviations to earlier reports were ascertained.
   Conclusion: With the Physcomitrella microsatellite marker set a valuable tool has been made available for further genetic and genomic applications on the intra-as well as on the interspecies level. The comparative survey of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellites among the plant kingdom is well suited for a classification of future studies on plant microsatellites.

AB Plant regeneration from cultured tissues has been shown to be under genetic control in a number of plant species. Using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping technology, it has become possible to estimate the number of loci controlling genetic variation and to characterize their map position in the genome. With the use of different types of mapping populations such as recombinant inbred lines (RIL), F2 or doubled haploids (DH) it was possible to detect QTLs for tissue culture response (TCR). For the evaluation of TCR numerous parameters describing induction and regeneration steps were applied. However, the lack of consistency with respect to parameters used by different researchers sometimes makes comparisons between QTL studies complicated. Another problem frequently present in works dealing with QTLs for TCR is skewed distributions of the traits used for evaluating tissue culture capability, usually interpreted as the indication of a presence of major genes. The majority of QTL analyses of TCR-traits were conducted with monocots - rice, barley and maize. The number of QTLs detected for a particular characteristic of tissue culture capability ranged from 1 to 8. The percentage of phenotypic variation explained by a single QTL varied from 2.7 to 65.4%, with the values between ca. 6 and ca. 26 % being more common. Determination of molecular markers linked to a QTL of TCR provides valuable tools for biotechnological approaches aimed at improving plant regeneration capability.

AB As part of an initiative to develop Brachypodium distachyon as a genomic "bridge" species between rice and the temperate cereals and grasses, a BAC library has been constructed for the two diploid (2n = 2x = 10) genotypes, ABR1 and ABR5. The library consists of 9100 clones, with an approximate average insert size of 88 kb, representing 2.22 genome equivalents. To validate the usefulness of this species for comparative genomics and gene discovery in its larger genome relatives, the library was screened by PCR using primers designed on previously mapped rice and Poaceae sequences. Screening indicated a degree of synteny between these species and B. distachyon, which was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization of the marker-selected BACs (BAC landing) to the 10 chromosome arms of the karyotype, with most of the BACs hybridizing as single loci on known chromosomes. Contiguous BACs colocalized on individual chromosomes, thereby confirming the conservation of genome synteny and proving that B. distachyon has utility as a temperate grass model species alternative to rice.

AB A genetic linkage mapping study was conducted in 93 doubled-haploid lines derived from a cross between Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell 'Arina' and a Norwegian spring wheat breeding line, NK93604, using diversity arrays technology (DArT), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The objective of this study was to understand the distribution, redundancy, and segregation distortion of DArT markers in comparison with AFLP and SSR markers. The map contains a total of 624 markers with 189 DArTs, 165 AFLPs and 270 SSRs, and spans 2595.5 cM. All 3 marker types showed significant (p < 0.01) segregation distortion, but it was higher for AFLPs (24.2%) and SSRs (22.6%) than for DArTs (13.8%). The overall segregation distortion was 20.4%. DArTs showed the highest frequency of clustering (27.0%) at < 0.5 cM intervals between consecutive markers, which is 3 and 15 times higher than SSRs (8.9%) and AFLPs (1.8%), respectively. This high proportion of clustering of DArT markers may be indicative of gene-rich regions and (or) the result of inclusion of redundant clones in the genomic representations, which was supported by the presence of very high correlation coefficients (r > 0.98) and multicollinearity among the clustered markers. The present study is the first to compare the utility of DArT with AFLP and SSR markers, and the present map has been successfully used to identify novel QTLs for resistance to Fusarium head blight and powdery mildew and for anther extrusion, leaf segment incubation, and latency.

TI Molecular characterization of a powdery mildew resistance gene in wheat

DE Triticum aestivum
ID MARKERS; IDENTIFICATION
AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat worldwide. Pyramiding race-specific genes into a single cultivar and combining race-specific resistance genes with durable resistance genes are the preferred strategies to improve the durability of powdery mildew resistance. The objectives of this study were to characterize a powdery mildew resistance gene in Suwon 92 and identify gene-specific or tightly linked molecular markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS). A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was derived by single seed descent from a cross between Suwon 92 and a Susceptible cultivar, CI 13227. The RILs were screened for adult-plant infection type of powdery mildew and characterized with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The linked markers explained 41.3 to 69.2% of the phenotypic variances measured in 2 years. A morphological marker, hairy glume, was also associated with powdery mildew resistance in Suwon 92, and explained 43 to 51% of the phenotypic variance. The powdery mildew resistance gene in Suwon 92 was located on the short arm of chromosome 1A where Pm3 was located. Two gene-specific markers were developed based on the sequence of the cloned Pm3b gene. These two markers, which were mapped at the same locus in the peak region of the LOD score for the RIL population. explained most of the phenotypic variance for powdery mildew resistance in the RIL population. The powdery mildew resistance in Suwon 92 is most likely conditioned by the Pm3 locus. The gene markers developed herein can be directly used for MAS of some of the Pm3 alleles in breeding programs.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the major constrains for wheat production in many wheat growing areas worldwide. Further understanding of inheritance of Al resistance may facilitate improvement of Al resistance of wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.). A set of ditelosomic lines derived from the moderately Al-resistant wheat cultivar Chinese Spring was assessed for Al resistance. The root growth of ditelosomic lines DT5AL, DT7AL, DT2DS and DT4DS was significantly lower than that of euploid Chinese Spring under Al stress, suggesting that Al-resistance genes might exist on the missing chromosome arms of 5AS, 7AS, 2DL and 4DL of Chinese Spring. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Annong 8455 x Chinese Spring-Sumai 3 7A substitution line was used to determine the effects of these chromosome arms on Al resistance. A genetic linkage map consisting of 381 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and 168 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was constructed to determine the genetic effect of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Al resistance in Chinese Spring. Three QTLs, Qalt.pser-4D, Qalt.pser-5A and Qalt.pser-2D, were identified that enhanced root growth under Al stress, suggesting that inheritance of Al resistance in Chinese Spring is polygenic. The QTL with the largest effect was flanked by the markers of Xcfd23 and Xwmc331 on chromosome 4DL and most probably is multi-allelic to the major QTL identified in Atlas 66. Two additional QTLs, Qalt.pser-5A and Qalt.pser-2D on chromosome 5AS and 2DL, respectively, were also detected with marginal significance in the population. Some SSR markers identified in this study would be useful for marker-assisted pyramiding of different QTLs for Al resistance in wheat cultivars.

AB Male sterility of wheat-breeding line 337S (Triticum aestivum L.) is sensitive to both short day-length/low temperature and long day-length/high temperature. 337S was crossed with the common wheat variety, Huamai No. 8 and the F-1 was highly fertile. The F-2 population segregated in a 15:1 ratio for fertility/sterility in 243 individuals under long day-length/high-temperature. The two thermophotoperiod-responsive male sterile genes were mapped to chromosomes 5B and 2B using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers and bulked segregant analysis. Partial linkage maps around the sterility loci of chromosomes 2B and 5B were constructed using the 243 individuals in the F-2 population. One gene (wptms1) for male sterility was flanked by the SSR markers Xgwm335 and Xgwm371 at a genetic distance in chromosome 5B of 4.1 and 24.4 cM, respectively. The second gene (wptms2) was mapped between markers Xgwm374 and Xgwm120 at a genetic distance of 6.6 and 20.9 cM, respectively. The closest linked markers Xgwm335 (wptms1) and Xgwm374 (wptms2) explained 53 and 38% of phenotypic variation for the fertility. The SSR markers provide a useful tool to transfer the male sterile genes into elite wheat germplasm.

AB Hybrid necrosis is the gradual premature death of leaves or plants in certain F-1 hybrids of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and it is caused by the interaction of two dominant complementary genes Ne1 and Ne2 located on chromosome arms 5BL and 2BS, respectively. To date, molecular markers linked to these genes have not been identified and linkage relationships of the two genes with other important genes in wheat have not been established. We observed that the F-1 hybrids from the crosses between the bread wheat variety 'Alsen' and four synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) lines (TA4152-19, TA4152-37, TA4152-44, and TA4152-60) developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) exhibited hybrid necrosis. This study was conducted to determine the genotypes of TA4152-60 and Alsen at the Ne1 and Ne2 loci, and to map the genes using microsatellite markers in backcross populations. Genetic analysis indicated that Alsen has the genotype ne1ne1Ne2Ne2 whereas the SHW lines have Ne1Ne1ne2ne2. The microsatellite marker Xbarc74 was linked to Ne1 at a genetic distance of 2.0 cM on chromosome arm 5BL, and Xbarc55 was 3.2 cM from Ne2 on 2BS. Comparison of the genetic maps with the chromosome deletion-based physical maps indicated that Ne1 lies in the proximal half of 5BL, whereas Ne2 is in the distal half of 2BS. Genetic linkage analysis showed that Ne1 was about 35 cM proximal to Tsn1, a locus conferring sensitivity to the host selective toxin Ptr ToxA produced by the tan spot fungus. The closely linked microsatellite markers identified in this study can be used to genotype parental lines for Ne1 and Ne2 or to eliminate the two hybrid necrosis genes using marker-assisted selection.

ID IDENTIFICATION; INHERITANCE; WHEAT; TOOL
AB Cleistogamy is the self-pollination within closed spikelets and is expected to be a useful genetic tool for prevention of possible gene transfer in transgenic crops, for maintenance of genetic purity in autogamous crops, and for increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Mapping of the gene ld(t), which is responsible for lack of lodicules inside spikelets and causes cleistogamy, was carried out using F-2 and F-3 populations derived from a cleistogamous (CL) mutant CL-SNU x Milyang 23 cross. A number of STS markers along chromosomes were developed and bulked segregant analysis was adopted for preliminary mapping. The results showed that the ld(t) was located at the end region of chromosome 1L, flanked by S01178b (an STS marker developed for the locus at 178 cM based on the rice genetic map reported by Japanese Rice Genome Project) at 0.8 cM and co-segregated with S01181a and S01181b (an STS marker developed for the locus at 181 cM).

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most devastating diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The objectives of this study were to map a stripe rust resistance gene in Chinese wheat cultivar Chuanmai 42 using molecular markers and to investigate its allelism with Yr24 and Yr26. A total of 787 F-2 plants and 186 F-3 lines derived from a cross between resistant cultivar Chuanmai 42 and susceptible line Taichung 29 were used for resistance gene tagging. Also 197 F-2 plants from the cross Chuanmai 42xYr24/3*Avocet S and 726 F-2 plants from Chuanmai 42xYr26/3*Avocet S were employed for allelic test of the resistance genes. In all, 819 pairs of wheat SSR primers were used to test the two parents, as well as resistant and susceptible bulks. Subsequently, nine polymorphic markers were employed for genotyping the F-2 and F-3 populations. Results indicated that the stripe rust resistance in Chuanmai 42 was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated YrCH42, located close to the centromere of chromosome 1B and flanked by nine SSR markers Xwmc626, Xgwm273, Xgwm11, Xgwm18, Xbarc137, Xbarc187, Xgwm498, Xbarc240 and Xwmc216. The resistance gene was closely linked to Xgwm498 and Xbarc187 with genetic distances of 1.6 and 2.3 cM, respectively. The seedling tests with 26 PST isolates and allelic tests indicated that YrCH42, Yr24 and Yr26 are likely to be the same gene.

AB A major fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance gene Fhb1 (syn. Qfhs.ndsu-3BS) was fine mapped on the distal segment of chromosome 3BS of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a Mendelian factor. FHB resistant parents, Sumai 3 and Nyubai, were used as sources of this gene. Two mapping populations were developed to facilitate segregation of Qfhs.ndsu-3BS in either a fixed resistant (Sumai 3*5/Thatcher) (S/T) or fixed susceptible (HC374/3*98B69-L47) (HC/98) genetic background (HC374 = Wuhan1/Nyubai) for Type II resistance. Type II resistance (disease spread within the spike) was phenotyped in the greenhouse using single floret injections with a mixture of macro-conidia of three virulent strains of Fusarium graminearum. Due to the limited heterogeneity in the genetic background of the crosses and based on the spread of infection, fixed recombinants in the interval between molecular markers XGWM533 and XGWM493 on 3BS could be assigned to discrete "resistant" and "susceptible" classes. The phenotypic distribution was bimodal with progeny clearly resembling either the resistant or susceptible parent. Marker order for the two maps was identical with the exception of marker STS-3BS 142, which was not polymorphic in the HC/98 population. The major gene Fhb1 was successfully fine mapped on chromosome 3BS in the same location in the two populations within a 1.27-cM interval (S/T) and a 6.05-cM interval (HC/98). Fine mapping of Fhb1 in wheat provides tightly linked markers that can reduce linkage drag associated with marker-assisted selection of Fhb1 and assist in the isolation, sequencing and functional identification of the underlying resistance gene.

AB Cereal cyst nematode (CCN; Heterodera avenae Woll.) is a root pathogen of cereals that can cause severe yield losses in intolerant wheat cultivars. Loci for resistance to CCN, measured by a seedling bioassay, were identified by creating a genetic map based on a Trident/Molineux doubled haploid population of 182 lines. A novel locus accounting for up to 14% of the resistance to CCN was mapped to chromosome 1B of Molineux by association with microsatellite marker loci Xwmc719 and Xgwm140. This locus acts additively with the previously identified CCN resistance loci identified on chromosomes 6B (Cre8) and 2A (Cre5 on the VPM1 segment) in this population to explain 44% of the genetic variance for this major wheat pathogen.

AB Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is adapted to the harsh environments of the Andean Altiplano region. Its seeds have a well-balanced amino acid composition and exceptionally high protein content with respect to human nutrition. Quinoa grain is a staple in the diet of some of the most impoverished people in the world. The plant is an allotetraploid displaying disomic inheritance (2n=4x=36) with a di-haploid genome of 967 Mbp (megabase pair), or 2C=2.01 pg. We constructed two quinoa BAC libraries using BamHI (26,880 clones) and EcoRI (48,000 clones) restriction endonucleases. Cloned inserts in the BamHI library average 113 kb (kilobase) with approximately 2% of the clones lacking inserts, whereas cloned inserts in the EcoRI library average 130 kb and approximately 1% lack inserts. Three plastid genes used as probes of high-density arrayed blots of 73,728 BACs identified approximately 2.8% of the clones as containing plastid DNA inserts. We estimate that the combined quinoa libraries represent at least 9.0 di-haploid nuclear genome equivalents. An average of 12.2 positive clones per probe were identified with 13 quinoa single-copy ESTs as probes of the high-density arrayed blots, suggesting that the estimate of 9.0x coverage of the genome is conservative. Utility of the BAC libraries for gene identification was demonstrated by probing the library with a partial sequence of the 11S globulin seed storage protein gene and identifying multiple positive clones. The presence of the 11S globulin gene in four of the clones was verified by direct comparison with quinoa genomic DNA on a Southern blot. Besides serving as a useful tool for gene identification, the quinoa BAC libraries will be an important resource for physical mapping of the quinoa genome.

AB In vitro micropropagation based on somatic embryogenesis provides an efficient means to multiply selected genotypes of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). Despite its considerable potential, somatic embryogenesis can yield plants bearing a homeotic flowering abnormality known as mantled. Because the mantled abnormality is epigenetic, it cannot be detected with conventional structural molecular markers. Thus, to develop a means of discriminating among callus cultures carrying or lacking the mantled abnormality, we used a gene expression approach. We describe two novel oil palm genes, EgM39A and EgIAA1, both of which display increased transcript accumulation in epigenetically abnormal calli. EgIAA1 codes for an oil palm relative of the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. AXR3/IAA17 protein involved in early auxin response and EgM39A codes for a protein of unknown function sharing sequence similarities with asparagine synthetases. In addition to their enhanced expression in somaclonal variant callus lines, both genes displayed increased transcript accumulation in response to auxin treatment. Normal seed-derived zygotic embryos germinated in the presence of auxin accumulated increased amounts of EgIAA1 transcripts after a few hours of treatment, suggesting a role in auxin response similar to that demonstrated for IAA genes in other species. The EgM39A gene also displayed enhanced transcript accumulation in auxin-treated zygotic embryos. Although only a small increase was seen after 24 h, greater changes were observed after 15 days. Both genes show potential as early markers of clonal conformity and may help to elucidate the nature of the epigenetic changes causing the mantled abnormality.

AB The genetic basis for some stability statistics used in plant breeding was investigated in this study by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis. The mapping population comprised 180 doubled haploid lines from a cross between Australian (VB9524) and North American (ND1 1231-12) two-rowed barley lines. Using a 211-point genetic linkage map, we identified six QTLs segregating for heading date in the population. These mapped to the approximate position of the major earliness genes (Ppd-H1 and Ppd-H2), and several genes for earliness in a narrow sense (earliness per se). By aligning the QTL positions with those for calculated stability statistics, we used the co-location of QTL positions to infer genetic basis. The stability statistics considered were Wricke's [Wricke, G., 1962. Uber eine Methode zur Erfassung der oekologischen Streubreite in Feldversuchen. Zeitschr f Pflanzenz 47, 92-96] Ecovalence (W-i), Eberhart and Russell's [Eberhart, S.A., Russell, W.A., 1966. Stability parameters for comparing varieties. Crop Sci. 6, 36-40] regression coefficient (SLOPE) and deviation from regression (MSDEV), Lin and Binns' [Lin, C.S., Binns, M.R., 1988. A superiority measure of cultivar performance for cultivar x location data. Can. J. Plant Sci. 68, 193-198] cultivar superiority measure (P-i) and the first two principal component axis scores (IPCA1 and IPCA2) from the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model.
   Based on a genome-wide LOD threshold of 3.0, we found little evidence for genetic control of MSDEV. However, Wi was considered to be under genetic control, due to a significant linkage (peak LOD = 4.85) to a locus on chromosome 2H where the Ppd-H1 gene is located. For SLOPE and IPCA1, strong evidence of genetic control was indicated by linkage to three unlinked loci. Two of these occurred at regions OD chromosomes 2HS and 5HL, close to the approximate locations of Ppd-H1 and eps5HL, and where heading date QTLs showed significant (P < 0.001) QTL x E interactions. For P-i, the genome-wide LOD profile matched that for heading date QTLs, with peak LOD scores at all regions where the QTLs were identified. The pattern of co-localisation of QTLs for stability parameters with those for heading date suggests that, in this population, G x E interactions might be largely controlled by allelic sensitivity.

AB Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng., a species endemic to China, is only distributed in Huashan Mountain in Shaanxi Province. It has been listed as "national first-class protected rare species." In this study, the microsatellites of barley were used to analyze genetic diversity of P. huashanica populations sampled from three valleys (Huangpu, Man and Huashan Valleys) in Mt. Huashan. A total of 33 alleles of 11 loci were detected from 266 individuals. The observed average number of alleles (A) is 2.75; the effective number of alleles (Ac) is 1.67. The percentage of polymorphic loci (PPB) is 58.33% in Huangpu Valley, 75% in Man Valley, 83.33% in Huashan Valley, and the total PPB is 83.33%. About 77.6% of (F(ST) = 0.324) genetic diversity was observed within the subpopulations. Genetic differentiation within each subpopulations was higher than that among the subpopulations. Mean genetic distance is 0.17 (range: 0.010-0.401). Correlation analysis detected significant correlation between genetic distance and vertical distance of altitude in Huashan Valley. Differentiation mainly occurred between the higher altitude subpopulations and the lower altitude subpopulations, suggesting that altitude might be the major factor that restricted the gene flow between different altitude subpopulations and resulted in differentiation of subpopulations.

AB Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular markers have been developed to detect the presence of primary parasitoids in cereal aphids and used to estimate primary parasitism rates. However, the presence of secondary parasitoids (hyperparasitoids) may lead to underestimates of primary parasitism rates based on PCR markers. This is because even though they kill the primary parasitoid, it's DNA can still be amplified, leading to an erroneous interpretation of a positive result. Another issue with secondary parasitoids is that adults are extremely difficult to identify using morphological characters. Therefore, we developed species-specific molecular markers to detect hyperparasitoids. A 16S ribosomal RNA mitochondrial gene fragment was amplified by PCR and sequenced from two secondary parasitoid species, Dendrocerus carpenteri (Curtis) (Hymenoptera: Megaspilidae) and Alloxysta xanthopsis (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Charipidae), four geographic isolates of the primary parasitoid, Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and six aphid species common to cereal crops. Species-specific PCR primers were designed for each insect on the basis of these 16S rRNA gene sequences. Amplification of template DNA, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, successfully distinguished D. carpenteri and A. xanthopsis from all four isolates of L. testaceipes and all six cereal aphid species in this laboratory test.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a serious disease of wheat worldwide that may cause substantial yield and quality losses. Breeding for FHB-resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective approach to control FHB. The objective of the present study was to determine the relationship of resistance between new resistant sources and Sumai 3 using five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers closely linked to the major QTL for FHB resistance on chromosome arms 3BS and 6BS. All five SSR markers were highly polymorphic between Sumai 3 (and its derivatives) and susceptible Canadian wheat lines. Most of the Sumai 3-derived Chinese wheat accessions and three Canadian FHB-resistant lines had all the Sumai 3 SSR marker alleles on chromosome arms 3BS and 6BS. The Chinese landrace Wangshuibai and two Japanese accessions Nobeokabozu and Nyu Bai had the same banding patterns as Sumai 3 for all five SSR marker alleles, and another Chinese landrace Fangshanmai had three of the five SSR markers in common with Sumai 3, and therefore most likely carries the same QTL as Sumai 3 on 3BS and 6BS. The Brazilian cultivar Frontana had no alleles in common with Sumai 3 on either QTL, and the Chinese landrace Hongheshang had only one of the five SSR markers in common with Sumai 3, therefore likely carrying resistance genes different from Sumai 3. The Italian cultivar Funo is not the donor of either the 3BS QTL or 6BS QTL. All five SSR seem to be effective candidates for marker-assisted selection to increase the level of resistance to FHB in wheat breeding programs.

AB Chitosan (beta-1,4-linked glucosamine oligomer) derived from crab shells conferred a high protection of grapevine leaves against grey mould caused by Botrytis cinerea. Under controlled conditions, it was shown to be an efficient elicitor of some defense reactions in grapevine leaves and to inhibit directly the in vitro development of B. cinerea. Treatment of grapevine leaves by chitosan led to marked induction of lipoxygenase (LOX), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chitinase activities, three markers of plant defense responses. Dose-response curves show that maximum defense reactions (PAL and chitinase activities) and strong reduction of B. cinerea infection were achieved with 75-150 mg l(-1)chitosan. However, greater concentrations of chitosan did not protect grapevine leaves with the same efficiency, but inhibited mycelial growth in vitro. Present results underlined the potency of chitosan in inducing some defense responses in grapevine leaves which in turn might improve resistance to grey mould.

AB The short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), An, was used to develop sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (S-SAP) markers for U- and M-genome chromosomes. The markers were localized using Triticum aestivum (wheat) - Aegilops geniculata and wheat - Aegilops biuncialis disomic chromosome addition lines. Thirty-seven markers distributed over 6 U and 6 M chromosomes were produced. A genetic diversity study carried out on 37 accessions from Ae. biuncialis, Ae. comosa, Ae. geniculata, and Ae. umbellulata suggested that Ae. biuncialis have arisen from its diploid ancestors more recently than Ae. geniculata. Several earlier studies indicated that the M genomes in polyploid Aegilops species had accumulated substantial rearrangements, whereas the U genomes remained essentially unmodified. However, this cannot be attributed to the preferential insertion of retroelements into the M genome chromosomes. Fourteen markers from a total of 8 chromosomes were sequenced; 3 markers were similar to known plant genes, I was derived from a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, and 10 markers did not match to any known DNA sequences, suggesting that they were located in the highly variable intergenic regions.

AB Tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) is the most important cereal crop in Ethiopia; however, there is very little DNA sequence information available for this species. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from 4 cDNA libraries: seedling leaf, seedling root, and inflorescence of E. tf and seedling leaf of Eragrostis pilosa, a wild relative of E. tef. Clustering of 3603 sequences produced 530 clusters and 1890 singletons, resulting in 2420 tef unigenes. Approximately 3/4 of tef unigenes matched protein or nucleotide sequences in public databases. Annotation of unigenes associated 68% of the putative tef genes with gene ontology categories. Identification of the translated unigenes for conserved protein domains revealed 389 protein family domains (Pfam), the most frequent of which was protein kinase. A total of 170 ESTs containing simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) were identified and 80 EST-SSR markers were developed. in addition, 19 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and (or) insertion-deletion (indel) and 34 intron fragment length polymorphism (IFLP) markers were developed. The EST database and molecular markers generated in this study will be valuable resources for further tef genetic research.

AB This study was conducted to assess regional patterns of diversity of Ethiopian tetraploid wheat accessions and to identify areas of diversity that can be used as source of new germplasm for developing high yielding and stable varieties. A collection of 133 Ethiopian tetraploid wheat accessions and eight introduced cultivars was analysed using 29 wheat microsatellite markers. A total of 383 alleles were detected with an average value of 13.14 alleles per locus. Relatively more alleles were observed in the B genome than in the A genome. Gene diversity indices ranged from 0.08 to 0.95, with a mean value of 0.72. Accessions collected from the same region were pooled and the number of alleles and gene diversity were calculated over the 29 simple sequence repeats for each region. Higher numbers of alleles were detected in the Shewa region (8.72), followed by Tigray (5.86) and Hararghe (5.76). The highest average gene diversity value was found in Shewa (0.65), followed by Gondar (0.64). No significant correlation was observed between geographic distance and genetic distance. Out of 383 different alleles detected, 93 (24.4%) were observed to be region-specific. Region-specific alleles were found across all chromosomes except for Xgwm752, Xgwm155 and Xgwm148. Genetic similarity coefficients were estimated for all the possible 55 pairs of regional comparisons and they ranged from 0.16 to 0.52, with a mean value of 0.50. All provinces were differentiated in the UPGMA cluster diagram.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, is a major disease problem in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Genetic engineering holds significant potential to enhance FHB resistance in wheat. Due to the requirement of screening for FHB resistance on flowers at anthesis, the number of screens carried out in a year is limited. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using the rapid-maturing dwarf wheat cultivar Apogee as an alternative genotype for transgenic FHB resistance research. Our transformation efficiency (number of transgenic plants/number of embryos) for Apogee was 1.33%. Apogee was also found to exhibit high FHB susceptibility and reached anthesis within 4 weeks. Interestingly, microsatellite marker haplotype analysis of the chromosome 3BS FHB resistant quantitative trait locus (QTL) region indicated that this region maybe deleted in Apogee. Our results indicate that Apogee is particularly well suited for accelerating transgenic FHB resistance research and transgenic wheat research in general.

AB Seed dormancy is an important trait for the analysis and manipulation of pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice. This study presents data on dissection of the genetic basis of the seed dormancy character in the indica cultivar N22, which exhibits levels of dormancy highly in excess of traditional rice cultivars. Three simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based linkage maps derived from two BC1-type populations of Nanjing35 (a japonica non-dormant breeding line)/N22//Nanjing35 and USSR5 (non-dormant japonica cultivar)/N22//USSR5, and one F-2 population of USSR5/N22, were constructed to detect genes controlling seed dormancy. Five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed dormancy, i.e., qSdn-1, qSdnj-3, qSdn-5, qSdn-7 and qSdn-11, were identified on chromosomes, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 11, respectively. The N22-derived alleles were observed to increase the seed dormancy at all the loci except qSdnj-3. Genes conferring seed dormancy in N22 showed incomplete dominance effect. Two QTLs, qSdn-5 and qSdn-11 were detected in the two BC1 populations, while qSdnj-3 and qSdn-7 were only identified in the one BC1, population (Nanjing35/N22//Nanjing35), whereas the QTL qSdn-1 was common in all the three populations. The dormancy trait was expressed whenever any of the dormancy genes presents and can be further improved by pyramiding these genes. Of all QTLs, qSdn-1 provided the most obvious target for marker-assisted selection (MAS) due to its stability for improving rice pre-harvest sprouting tolerance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB To individuate candidate genes (CGs) for a set of barley developmental mutants, a synteny approach comparing the genomes of barley and rice has been introduced. Based on map positions of mutants, sequenced RFLP markers linked to the target loci were selected. The markers were mapped in silico by BLAST searches against the rice genome sequence and chromosomal regions syntenous to barley target intervals were identified. Rice syntenous regions were defined for 15 barley chromosomal intervals hosting 23 mutant loci affecting plant height (brh1; brh2; sld4), shoot and inflorescence branching (als; brc1; cul-2, -3, -5, -15, -16; dub1; mnd6; vrs1), development of leaves (lig) and leaf-like organs (cal-b19, -C15, -d4; lks5; suKD-25; suKE-74; suKF-76; trd; trp). Annotation of 110 Mb of rice genomic sequence made it possible to screen for putative CGs which are listed together with the reasons supporting mutant-gene associations. For two loci, CGs were identified with a clear probability to represent the locus considered. These include FRIZZY PANICLE, a candidate for the brc1 barley mutant, and the rice ortholog of maize Liguleless1 (Lg1), a candidate for the barley lig locus on chromosome 2H. For this locus, the validity of the approach was supported by the PCR-amplification of a genomic fragment of the orthologous barley sequence. SNP mapping located this fragment on chromosome 2H in the region hosting the lig genetic locus.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most damaging diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). With the objective of identifying and tagging new genes for resistance to stripe rust, F-1, F-2 and F-3 populations from the cross Zhou 8425B/Chinese Spring were inoculated with Chinese PST isolate CYR32 in the greenhouse. A total of 790 SSR primers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. The resulting seven polymorphic markers on chromosome 7BL were used for genotyping F-2 and F-3 populations. Results indicated that Zhou 8425B carries a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated YrZH84, closely linked to SSR markers Xcfa2040-7B and Xbarc32-7B with genetic distances of 1.4 and 4.8 cM, respectively. In a seedling test with 25 PST isolates, the reaction patterns of YrZH84 were different from those of lines carrying Yr2 and Yr6. It was concluded that YrZH84 is probably a new stripe rust resistance gene.

AB An uncharacterized source of seedling resistance to Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici was identified in an advanced wheat breeding line WAWHT2046. Genetic analysis based on a WAWHT2046/Carnamah-derived double haploid (DH) population demonstrated monogenic inheritance of seedling stripe rust resistance in WAWHT2046. The gene controlling stripe rust resistance in line WAWHT2046 was tentatively designated YrWA. The chromosome 5AL located awn inhibitor gene B1, possessed by WAWHT2046, also showed monogenic inheritance when the DH population was scored for the presence and absence of awns. Joint segregation analysis at the B1 and YrWA loci indicated genetic linkage between the two loci. A recombination value of 12.2 cM was computed using Mapmanager. This association located YrWA in the chromosome arm 5AL. Molecular mapping using microsatellite markers placed YrWA distal to B1. All molecular markers mapped proximal to the awn inhibitor locus B1. As no other stripe rust resistance gene is reported to be located in the chromosome arm 5AL, YrWA was permanently designated as Yr34. Yr34 produced an intermediate (23C) seedling infection type and expressed very low stripe rust response (10R-MR) on adult plants in the field, similar to the resistance gene Yr17. In addition to Yr34, this mapping population segregated for three genetically independent adult plant stripe rust resistance genes. The detection of DH lines with completely susceptible response, higher than that shown by the Yr34-lacking parent Carnamah, suggested that both parents contributed adult plant resistance. The use of WAWHT2046 as a parent in breeding programs would also contribute APR in addition to Yr34.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) severity was evaluated in a set of recombinant inbred (RI) lines from a cross between the two-rowed barley varieties, Harbin 2-row (resistant) and Turkey 6 (susceptible). Harbin 2-row was one of the most resistant varieties to FHB among ca. 5,000 barley germplasm accessions stored at Okayama University. The FHB severity of the RI lines and their parents was evaluated by the 'cut-spike test' in the 2000-2001 and 2003-2004 seasons. Spikes with disease symptoms were scored based on eleven grades from resistant (0) to susceptible (10). A high-density linkage map, including 328 AFLP, 45 SSR, one RFLP-STS, one AFLP-STS, four resistance gene analog (RGA) and four morphological markers, was constructed to detect QTLs for FHB severity. Composite interval mapping enabled to detect one QTL on chromosome 2H in the 2000-2001 season, and one QTL on chromosome 4H and another QTL on chromosome 6H in the 2003-2004 season. At these three QTLs, the alleles from Harbin 2-row contributed to a lower severity. A QTL oil chromosome 2H was located in the vicinity of the cleistogamy locus (cly1 or Cly2) that determines open/closed flowering type. The comparison with previously identified QTLs for FHB severity by the present authors indicated that Harbin 2-row might harbor the same resistance allele in the vicinity of the cly1/Cly2 locus as Russia 6, which was used as a resistant parent in the previous study. The QTL in the vicinity of the cly1/Cly2 locus is one of the promising sources for FHB resistance breeding in barley.

AB Recent reports suggested that the Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko, RWA) resistance gene Dn5 is located on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome arm 7DS rather than on 7DL. A further attempt was therefore made to physically map the gene employing the same source material previously used to describe, name, and map it. It was possible to derive monotelosomic 7DL plants carrying Dn5 on the telosome. Such plants could not be developed for the short arm. The identities of the 7DS and 7DL telosomes were confirmed using mapped microsatellite and endopeptidase markers and showed unequivocally that Dn5 occurs on 7DL. It appears that use of the wrong Dn5 source material could explain some of the inconsistencies in earlier genetic studies involving this gene. In an attempt to also genetically map Dn5, a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population was derived from the cross PI 294994 X 'Chinese Spring' (CS). A single RWA resistance gene, believed to be Dn5, segregated in the population and was mapped together with 12 microsatellite loci and the Ep-D1 locus. The Dn gene mapped near the centromere on 7DS. However, closer inspection of the data suggested that segregation distortion with opposite effect occurred within two areas of the region that was being mapped. The combined distortion effect rendered the data unreliable and it was not possible to unambiguously determine the chromosome arm on which the Dn gene resides. It appeared that the chromosome 7D proximal regions may be problematic in terms of genetic analysis based on segregation data.

AB Unigene derived microsatellite (UGMS) markers have the advantage of assaying variation in the expressed component of the genome with unique identity and positions. We characterized the microsatellite motifs present in the unigenes of five cereal species namely, rice, wheat, maize, Sorghum and barley and compared with those in Arabidopsis. The overall UGMS frequency in the five cereal species was 1/7.6 kb. The maximum UGMS frequency was in rice (1/3.6 kb) and the lowest in wheat (1/10.6 kb). GC-rich trinucleotide repeat motifs coding for alanine followed by arginine and the dinucleotide repeat motif GA were found to be abundant UGMS classes across all the five cereal species. Primers could be designed for 95% (wheat and barley) to 97% (rice) of the identified microsatellites. The proportion and frequency of occurrence of long hypervariable class I (>= 20 nucleotides) and potentially variable class II (12-20 nucleotides) UGMS across five cereal species were characterized. The class I UGMS markers were physically mapped in silico on to the finished rice genome and bin-mapped in wheat. Comparative mapping based on class I UGMS markers in rice and wheat revealed syntenic relationships between the two genomes. High degree of conservation and cross-transferability of the class I UGMS markers were evident among the five cereal species, which was validated experimentally. The class I UGMS-conserved orthologous set (COS) markers identified in this study would be useful for understanding the evolution of genes and genomes in cereals.

AB We investigated the allelic nature and map locations of Hordeum vulgare (barley) homologs to three classes of Arabidopsis low temperature (LT) regulatory genes-CBFs, ICE1, and ZAT12-to determine if there were any candidates for winterhardiness-related quantitative trait loci (QTL). We phenotyped the Dicktoo x Morex (DxM) mapping population under controlled freezing conditions and in addition to the previously reported 5H-L Fr-H1 QTL, observed three additional LT tolerance QTLs on 1H-L, 4H-S, and 4H-L. We identified and assigned either linkage map or chromosome locations to 1 ICE1 homolog, 2 ZAT12 homologs, and 17 of 20 CBF homologs. Twelve of the CBF genes were located on 5H-L and the 11 with assigned linkage map positions formed 2 tandem clusters on 5H-L. A subset of these CBF genes was confirmed to be physically linked, validating the map position clustering. The tandem CBF clusters are not candidates for the DxM LT tolerance Fr-H1 QTL, as they are similar to 30 cM distal to the QTL peak. No LT tolerance QTL was detected in conjunction with the CBF gene clusters in Dicktoo x Morex. However, comparative mapping using common markers and BIN positions established the CBF clusters are coincident with reported Triticeae LT tolerance and COR gene accumulation QTLs and suggest one or more of the CBF genes may be candidates for Fr-H2 in some germplasm combinations. These results suggest members of the CBF gene family may function as components of winterhardiness in the Triticeae and underscore both the importance of extending results from model systems to economically important crop species and in viewing QTL mapping results in the context of multiple germplasm combinations.

AB Plant breeding data comprise unbalanced phenotypic data for inbreds with complex pedigrees. As traditional methods to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) cannot exploit plant breeding data, an alternative approach is QTL mapping via a mixed-model procedure. Our objective was to validate mixed-model QTL mapping for self-pollinated crops by detecting QTL for kernel hardness and dough strength from data in a bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding program. We studied 80 parental and 373 experimental inbreds genotyped for 65 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and three candidate loci. The methodology involved three steps: variance component estimation, single-marker analyses, and a final multiple-marker analysis with marker effects treated as fixed effects. Two QTLs for kernel hardness were detected on chromosomes 1A (close to candidate locus GluA3) and 5D (close to candidate locus Ha). Four QTLs were detected for dough strength on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, and 5B. Candidate gene GluA1, which was associated with dough strength, was the only candidate locus found significant. Results were consistent with previously reported markers and QTLs associated with kernel hardness and dough strength. Unlike previous studies that have assumed QTL effects as random, the assumption of fixed marker effects identified the favorable marker alleles to select for. We conclude that the detection of previously mapped QTL validates the usefulness of mixed-model QTL mapping in the context of a plant-breeding program.

AB The bean pod weevil (Apion godmani Wagner) is a serious insect pest of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in Mexico and Central America that is best controlled by host-plant resistance available in Durango or Jalisco genotypes such as J-117. Given unreliable infestation by the insect, the use of marker-assisted selection is desirable. In the present study, we developed a set of nine molecular markers for Apion resistance and mapped them to loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 6 (linkage groups b01, b08, b07 and b11, respectively) based on genetic analysis of an F (5:10) susceptible x resistant recombinant inbred line population (Jamapa x J-117) and two reference mapping populations (DOR364 x G19833 and BAT93 x JaloEEP558) for which chromosome and linkage group designations are known. All the markers were derived from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) bands that were identified through bulked segregant analysis and cloned for conversion to sequence tagged site (STS) markers. One of the markers was dominant while four detected polymorphism upon digestion with restriction enzymes. The other markers were mapped as RAPD fragments. Phenotypic data for the population was based on the evaluation of percentage seed damage in replicated trials conducted over four seasons in Mexico. In single point regression analysis, individual markers explained from 3.5 to 22.5% of the variance for the resistance trait with the most significant markers overall being F10-500S, U1-1400R, R20-1200S, W9-1300S and Z4-800S, all markers that mapped to chromosome 2 (b01). Two additional significant markers, B1-1400R and W6-800R, were mapped to chromosome 6 (b11) and explained from 4.3 to 10.2% of variance depending on the season. The latter of these markers was a dominant STS marker that may find immediate utility in marker-assisted selection. The association of these two loci with the Agr and Agm genes is discussed as well as the possibility of additional resistance genes on chromosome 4 (b07) and chromosome 3 (b08). These are among the first specific markers developed for tagging insect resistance in common bean and are expected to be useful for evaluating the mechanism of resistance to A. godmani.

AB Wheat flowering is controlled by numerous genes, which respond to environmental signals such as photoperiod and vernalization. Earliness per se (Eps) genes control flowering time independently of these environmental cues and are responsible for the fine tuning of flowering time. We recently mapped the Eps-A(m)1 gene on the end of Triticum monococcum chromosome arm 1A(m)L. As a part of our efforts to clone Eps-A(m)1 we developed PCR markers flanking this gene within a 2.7 cM interval. We screened more than one thousand gametes with these markers and identified 27 lines with recombination between them. Recombinant lines were used to generate a high-density map and to investigate the microcolinearity between wheat and rice in this region. We mapped ten genes from a 149 kb region located at the distal part of rice chromosome 5 (cdo393 - Ndk3) on a 3.7 cM region on wheat chromosome one. This region is part of an ancient duplication between rice chromosomes 5 and 1. Genes present in both rice chromosomes were less similar to each other than to the closest wheat orthologues, suggesting that this duplication preceded the divergence between wheat and rice. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of 18 loci duplicated both in rice chromosomes 5 and 1 and in the colinear wheat chromosomes from homoeologous groups 1 and 3. Independent gene deletions in wheat and rice lineages explain the alternations of colinearity between rice chromosome 5 and wheat chromosomes 1 and 3. Colinearity between the end of rice chromosome 5 and wheat chromosome 1 was also interrupted by a small inversion, and several non-colinear genes. These results suggest that the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 1 was involved in numerous changes that differentiated wheat and rice genomes. This comparative study provided sufficient markers to saturate the Eps-A(m)1 gene region and to precisely map this gene within a 0.9 cM interval flanked by the VatpC and Smp loci.

AB The world's oldest and largest Medicago truncatula collection is housed at the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI). We used six simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci to analyse the genetic diversity and relationships between randomly selected individuals from 192 accessions in the core collection. M. truncatula is composed of three subspecies (ssp.): ssp. truncatula, ssp. longeaculeata, and ssp. tricycla. Analysis at the level of six SSR loci supports the concept of ssp. tricycla, all the samples of which showed unique alleles at two loci. Contingency Chi-squared tests were significant between ssp. tricycla and ssp. truncatula at four loci, suggesting a barrier to gene flow between these subspecies. In accessions defined as ssp. longeaculeata, no unique allelic distribution or diagnostic sizes were observed, suggesting this apparent ssp. is a morphological variant of ssp. truncatula. The data also suggest M. truncatula that exhibits unusually wide genotype dispersal throughout its native Mediterranean region, possibly due to animal and trade-related movements. Our results showed the collection to be highly diverse, exhibiting an average of 25 SSR alleles per locus, with over 90% of individuals showing discrete genotypes. The rich diversity of the SARDI collection provides an invaluable resource for studying natural allelic variation of M. truncatula. To efficiently exploit the variation in the SARDI collection, we have defined a subset of accessions (n=61) that maximises the diversity.

AB Common PCR assays for quantification of fungi in living plants cannot be used to study saprophytic colonization of fungi because plant decomposition releases PCR-inhibiting substances and saprophytes degrade the plant DNA which could serve as internal standard. The microsatellite PCR assays presented here overcome these problems by spiking samples prior to DNA extraction with mycelium of a reference strain. PCR with fluorescent primers co-amplifies microsatellite fragments of different length from target and reference strains. These fragments were separated in a capillary sequencer with fluorescence detection. The target/reference ratio of fluorescence signal was used to calculate target biomass in the sample. Such PCR assays were developed for the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing wheat and maize pathogen Fusarium graminearum and the biocontrol agent Trichoderma atroviride, using new microsatellite markers. In contrast to real-time PCR assays, the novel PCR assays showed reliable fungal biomass quantification in samples with differentially decomposed plant tissue. The PCR assays were used to quantify the two fungi after competitive colonization of autoclaved maize leaf tissue in microcosms. Using a DON-producing F. graminearum wild-type strain and its nontoxigenic mutant we found no evidence for a role of DON production in F. graminearum defense against T. atroviride. The presence of T. atroviride resulted in a 36% lower wild-type DON production per biomass.

ID HETEROZYGOSITY; SEQUENCES; DISTANCE; NUMBER; DNA
AB Genetic diversity in five wild types of wheat was estimated using Simpson's index (based on heterozygosity) applied to data from AFLP markers. For such studies, the cost of obtaining the required information increases both with the number of samples required to estimate diversity and with the number of markers used. When the population studied is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), allelic frequencies follow the binomial expansion and parametric methods can be used to calculate the variance of the diversity index in terms of the number of individuals sampled. Inbred species are never in HWE. With regard to such populations, this study addresses the question of the sample size required to estimate gene diversity using a distribution-free re-sampling method. We studied populations of five wild species (Aegilops speltoides, Triticum urartu, Triticum boeoticum, Triticum dicoccoides, and Triticum araraticum) as sources of diversity. We used bootstrap re-sampling with varying sample sizes to develop a relationship between the precision of the diversity estimate and the sample size. Such a relationship was used to determine the samples required for capturing a given amount of diversity and its precision. We found that 5-6 samples are sufficient to obtain a standard error equal to 10% of the diversity in the populations of the species Ae. speltoides, T. dicoccoides and T. araraticum. However, more than 12 samples would be needed for populations of T. urartu and T. boeoticum. The procedure presented here can be used to obtain the optimum sample size for other crop species as well.

AB Association mapping is a method for detection of gene effects based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) that complements QTL analysis in the development of tools for molecular plant breeding. In this study, association snapping was performed on a selected sample of 95 cultivars of soft winter wheat. Population structure was estimated on the basis of 36 unlinked simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The extent of LD was estimated on chromosomes 2D and part of 5A, relative to the LD observed among unlinked markers. Consistent LD on chromosome 2D was 1 cM, whereas in the centromeric region of 5A, LD extended for similar to 5 cM. Association of 62 SSR loci on chromosomes 2D, 5A, and 5B with kernel morphology and milling quality was analyzed through a mixed-effects model, where subpopulation was considered as a random factor and the marker tested was considered as a fixed factor. Permutations were used to adjust the threshold of significance for multiple testing within chromosomes. In agreement with previous QTL analysis, significant markers for kernel size were detected on the three chromosomes tested, and alleles potentially useful for selection were identified. Our results demonstrated that association snapping could complement and enhance previous QTL information for marker-assisted selection.

AB Wheat-barley chromosome addition lines are useful genetic resources for a variety of studies. In this study, transcript accumulation patterns in Betzes barley, Chinese Spring wheat, and Chinese Spring-Betzes chromosome addition lines were examined with the Barley1 Affymetrix GeneChip probe arrays Of the 4014 transcripts detected in Betzes but not in Chinese Spring, 365, 271, 265, 323, 194, and 369 were detected in wheat-barley disomic chromosome addition lines 2(2H), 3(3H), 4(4H), 7(5H), 6(6H), and 1(7H), respectively Thus, 1787 barley transcripts were detected in a wheat genetic background and, by virtue of the addition line in which the), were detected, were physical), mapped to barley chromosomes. We validated and extended our approach to physically map barley genes to the long and short arms of chromosome 6(6H). Our physical map data exhibited a high level of synteny with homologous sequences oil the wheat and/or rice syntenous chromosomes, indicating that our barley physical maps are robust. Our results show that barley transcript detection in wheat-barley chromosome addition lines is all efficient approach for large-scale physical mapping of genes.

   PATHWAYS
AB Lodging can be a serious problem in oilseed Brassica napus. Dwarf genes have been used to reduce lodging in other crops, and their use in wheat and rice was a major factor in the success of the 'Green Revolution'. We previously reported on a single, semi-dominant, gibberellin insensitive dwarf mutant of B. rapa (Brrga1-d), and provided evidence for homology of this gene to the wheat 'Green Revolution' dwarf gene. In this paper, we report using interspecific hybridization of B. rapa and B. oleracea and embryo rescue to resynthesize B. napus containing the Brrga1-d dwarf gene. The dwarf gene was backcrossed into two parents of a commercial hybrid combination and evaluated as inbred and hybrid lines in field experiments. The Brrga1-d gene reduced plant height and lodging in inbred and hybrid lines of B. napus, even when present as a single dose in heterozygous genotypes. Seed yields of inbred lines homozygous for Brrga1-d were reduced compared to near isogenic wild-type inbreds, presumably due to damage by insects caused by a slight delay in flowering time. However, yields of hybrids that were homozygous or heterozygous for Brrga1-d were similar to those of near isogenic wild-type hybrids. In addition, we report on a 'perfect' PCR marker for selection of the Brrga1-d gene that is based on detecting the nucleotide mutation causing the dwarf phenotype.

AB The endopeptidase marker Ep-D1b and Sequence Tag Site (STS) marker XustSSR2001-7DL were reported to be closely associated with the most effective resistance gene (Pch1) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for strawbreaker foot rot [Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides (Fron) Deighton]. Our objectives were to: (i) develop an efficient assay method for Ep-D1b in wheat; (ii) correlate endopeptidase zymograms to strawbreaker foot rot reactions of various wheat genotypes; and (iii) compare the utility of Ep-D1b and XustSSR2001-7DL for predicting disease response. An improved method of assaying for the Ep-D1b marker using roots from a single seedling was developed, which is a 2.5-fold improvement over the previous method. Thirty-eight wheat genotypes with known reactions to strawbreaker foot rot were analysed for Ep-D1b and the STS marker. Six distinct endopeptidase zymograms were identified among these 38 genotypes tested, and three of these patterns were novel. The endopeptidase marker was 100% accurate for predicting strawbreaker foot rot disease response, whereas the STS marker predicted the correct phenotype with approximately 90% accuracy. The endopeptidase marker Ep-D1b was more effective and was more economical for use in marker-assisted selection strategies for Pch1 in our laboratory compared with the STS marker.

AB Identity of quantitative trait loci (QTL) governing resistance to fusarium head blight (FHB) initial infection (type I), spread (type II), kernel infection, and deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation was characterized in Chinese wheat line W14. Ninety-six double-haploid lines derived from a cross of W14 x 'Pion2684' were evaluated for FHB resistance in two greenhouse and one field experiment. Two known major QTL were validated on chromosomes 3BS and 5AS in W14 using the composite interval mapping method. The 3BS QTL had a larger effect on resistance than the 5AS QTL in the greenhouse experiments, whereas, the 5AS QTL had a larger effect in the field experiment. These two QTL together explained 33%, 35%, and 31% of the total phenotypic variation for disease spread, kernel infection, and DON concentration in the greenhouse experiments, respectively. In the field experiment, the two QTL explained 34% and 26% of the total phenotypic variation for FHB incidence and severity, respectively. W14 has both QTL, which confer reduced initial infection, disease spread, kernel infection, and DON accumulation. Therefore, marker-assisted selection (MAS) for both QTL should be implemented in incorporating W14 resistance into adapted backgrounds. Flanking markers Xbarc133 and Xgwm493 on 3BS and Xbarc117 and Xbarc56 on 5AS are suggested for MAS.

AB Kernel hardness that is conditioned by puroindoline genes has a profound effect on milling, baking and end-use quality of bread wheat. In this study, 219 landraces and 166 historical cultivars from China and 12 introduced wheats were investigated for their kernel hardness and puroindoline alleles, using molecular and biochemical markers. The results indicated that frequencies of soft, mixed and hard genotypes were 42.7, 24.3, and 33.0%, respectively, in Chinese landraces and 45.2, 13.9, and 40.9% in historical cultivars. The frequencies of PINA null, Pinb-D1b and Pinb-D1p genotypes were 43.8, 12.3, and 39.7%, respectively, in hard wheat of landraces, while 48.5, 36.8, and 14.7%, respectively, in historical hard wheats. A new Pinb-D1 allele, designated Pinb-D1t, was identified in two landraces, Guangtouxianmai and Hongmai from the Guizhou province, with the characterization of a glycine to arginine substitution at position 47 in the coding region of Pinb gene. Surprisingly, a new Pina-D1 allele, designated Pina-D1m, was detected in the landrace Hongheshang, from the Jiangsu province, with the characterization of a proline to serine substitution at position 35 in the coding region of Pina gene; it was the first novel mutation found in bread wheat, resulting in a hard endosperm with PINA expression. Among the PINA null genotypes, an allele designed as Pina-D1l, was detected in five landraces with a cytosine deletion at position 265 in Pina locus; while another novel Pina-D1 allele, designed as Pina-D1n, was identified in six landraces, with the characterization of an amino acid change from tryptophan-43 to a 'stop' codon in the coding region of Pina gene. The study of puroindoline polymorphism in Chinese wheat germplasm could provide useful information for the further understanding of the molecular basis of kernel hardness in bread wheat.

AB The broad-spectrum stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided protection in wheat against Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici for over 80 years. The Sr2 gene and an associated dark pigmentation trait, pseudo-black chaff (PBC), have previously been localized to the short arm of chromosome 3B. In a first step towards the positional-based cloning of Sr2, we constructed a high-resolution map of this region. The wheat EST (wEST) deletion bin mapping project provided tightly linked cDNA markers. The rice genome sequence was used to infer the putative gene order for orthologous wheat genes and provide additional markers once the syntenic interval in rice was identified. We used this approach to map six wESTs that were collinear with the physical order of the corresponding genes on rice chromosome 1 suggesting there are no major re-arrangements between wheat and rice in this region. We were unable to separate by recombination the tightly linked morphological trait, PBC from the stem rust resistance gene suggesting that either a single gene or two tightly linked genes control both traits.

AB Resistance based on slow-rusting genes has proven to be a useful strategy to develop wheat cultivars with durable resistance to rust diseases in wheat. However this type of resistance is often difficult to incorporate into a single genetic background due to the polygenic and additive nature of the genes involved. Therefore, markers, both molecular and phenotypic, are useful tools to facilitate the use of this type of resistance in wheat breeding programs. We have used field assays to score for both leaf and yellow rust in an Avocet-YrA x Attila population that segregates for several slow-rusting leaf and yellow rust resistance genes. This population was analyzed with the AFLP technique and the slow-rusting resistance locus Lr46/Yr29 was identified. A common set of AFLP and SSR markers linked to the Lr46/Yr29 locus was identified and validated in other recombinant inbred families developed from single chromosome recombinant populations that segregated for Lr46. These populations segregated for leaf tip necrosis (LTN) in the field, a trait that had previously been associated with Lr34/Yr18. We show that LTN is also pleiotropic or closely linked to the Lr46/Yr29 locus and suggest that a new Ltn gene designation should be given to this locus, in addition to the one that already exists for Lr34/Yr18. Coincidentally, members of a small gene family encoding beta-1 proteasome subunits located on group 1L and 7S chromosomes implicated in plant defense were linked to the Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29 loci.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a serious disease in wheat and barley affecting both yield and quality. To identify genes for resistance to infection, the RIL population derived from 'Nanda2419' x 'Wangshuibai' and the parents were evaluated for percentage of infected spikes (PIS) in four different environments. Using a 2,960 cM marker framework map constructed for this population, ten chromosome regions were detected for their association with type I resistance through interval mapping with Mapmaker/QTL, among which QTLs mapped in the intervals of Xwmc349 similar to Xgwm149 on chromosome 4B, of Xwmc96 similar to Xgwm304 on chromosome 5A and of Xgwm408 similar to Xbarc140 on chromosome 5B were revealed in at least three environments and have Wangshuibai as the source of resistance alleles. Qfhi.nau-4B and Qfhi.nau-5A had larger effects and explained up to 17.5 and 27.0% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. To detect epistasis QTLs, two-locus interactions were examined by whole genome scan. Interactions of five locus pairs were found to have significant effects on type I resistance with the LOD score ranging 3.8-6.5 and four of them conferred resistance in parental phase. The one with the most significant effect was Xcfd42 similar to Xgwm469 (6D)/Xwmc390-2 similar to Xbd04 (2A) pair. No QTL x E interaction was detected for PIS. It was found that flowering time did not have significant effects on PIS in this population. Our studies indicated that Wangshuibai is useful for breeding for both type I and type II scab resistance and the markers associated with the QTLs could be used in marker-assisted selection and isolation of scab-resistance QTLs.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in wheat that reduces grain yield, grain quality and contaminates the harvest with deoxynivalenol (DON). As potent resistance sources Sumai 3 and its descendants from China and Frontana from Brazil had been analysed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. We introgressed and stacked two donor QTL from CM82036 (Sumai 3/Thornbird) located on chromosomes 3B and 5A and one donor QTL from Frontana on chromosome 3A in elite European spring wheat and estimated the effects of the three individual donor QTL and their four combinations on DON, Fusarium exoantigen content, and FHB rating adjusted to heading date. One class with the susceptible QTL alleles served as control. Each of the eight QTL classes was represented by 12-15 F-3-derived lines tested in F-5 generation as bulked progeny possessing the respective marker alleles homozygously. Traits were evaluated in a field experiment across four locations with spray inoculation of Fusarium culmorum. All three individual donor-QTL alleles significantly reduced DON content and FHB severity compared to the marker class with no donor QTL. The only exception was the donor-QTL allele 3A that had a low, but non-significant effect on FHB severity. The highest effect had the stacked donor-QTL alleles 3B and 5A for both traits. They jointly reduced DON content by 78% and FHB rating by 55% compared to the susceptible QTL class. Analysis of Fusarium exoantigen content illustrates that lower disease severity is associated with less mycelium content in the grain. In conclusion, QTL from non-adapted sources could be verified in a genetic background of German elite spring wheat. Within the QTL classes significant (P < 0.05) genotypic differences were found among the individual genotypes. An additional phenotypic selection would, therefore, be advantageous after performing a marker-based selection.

AB DNA-based molecular markers have been used in numerous studies for tagging specific genes in wheat for subsequent use in marker-assisted selection. Usually in plant breeding, procedures for mapping genes are based on analysis of a single segregating population. However, breeding programmes routinely evaluate large numbers of progeny derived from multiple-related crosses with some parental lines shared. In most such related crosses, the number of progeny is quite small. Thus, statistical techniques for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using data from conventional multi-cross breeding programmes are interesting. The objective of this study is to present a mixture model for QTL mapping in crosses of multiple inbred varieties with non-normal phenotype distributions and to use this model to map QTLs for yellow rust resistance in elite wheat breeding material. Three doubled haploid populations consisting of 41, 42 and 55 lines, respectively, originating from four parental varieties were studied. Multi-cross QTL analysis with three specific pathogen isolates of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and a mixture of the isolates revealed QTLs for resistance at four different genomic locations. These QTLs were found on chromosome 2AL, 2AS, 2BL and 6BL and explained between 21 and 41% of the phenotypic variation. Two of these QTLs, one on the long arm of chromosome 2A and one on the short arm of chromosome 2A were identical to the known yellow rust resistance genes Yr32 and Yr17, respectively, whereas the QTLs located on the long arms of chromosomes 2B and 6B may reflect types of resistance to yellow rust, which have not previously been mapped.

AB A set of 84 bread wheat lines, each containing a single homozygous introgression of the Aegilops tauschii genome was produced in the 'Chinese Spring' background via backcrossing of the D-genome chromosome substitution lines 'Chinese Spring'/Sears's 'Synthetic 6x' with the recurrent parent and subsequent selfing. The development of the lines was accompanied by microsatellite marker assisted selection. With the exception of three telomeric regions at chromosomes 1DL, 4DL and 7DS, and a region of less than 24 cM on the chromosome arm 3DL, the genome of Ae. tauschii is fully represented in these lines. The newly developed lines were used for the discovery of morphological and agronomical quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from the wild species. Fifty-two introgression lines were grown in the field and evaluated for six traits including flowering time, plant height, ear length, spikelet number, fertility and grain weight per ear. Seventeen significant QTLs were detected, Ae. tauschii contributed favourable alleles at nine loci influencing five traits. The whole set of 84 homozygous lines provides a tool for further testing the effects and stability of the detected QTLs and for the evaluation of new traits.

AB Grain yield and associated agronomic traits are important factors in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement. Knowledge regarding the number, genomic location, and effect of quantitative trait loci (QTL) would facilitate marker-assisted selection and the development of cultivars with desirable characteristics. Our objectives were to identify QTLs directly and indirectly affecting grain yield expression. A population of 132 F-12 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was derived by single-seed descent from a cross between the Chinese facultative wheat Ning7840 and the US soft red winter wheat Clark. Phenotypic data were collected for 15 yield and other agronomic traits in the RILs and parental lines from three locations in Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. Twenty-nine linkage groups, consisting of 363 AFLP and 47 SSR markers, were identified. Using composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis, 10, 16, 30, and 14 QTLs were detected for yield, yield components, plant adaptation (shattering and lodging resistance, heading date, and plant height), and spike morphology traits, respectively. The QTL effects ranged from 7 to 23%. Marker alleles from Clark were associated with a positive effect for the majority of QTLs for yield and yield components, but gene dispersion was the rule rather than the exception for this RIL population. Often, QTLs were detected in proximal positions for different traits. Consistent, co-localized QTLs were identified in linkage groups 1AL, 1B, 4B, 5A, 6A, and 7A, and less consistent but unique QTLs were identified on 2BL, 2BS, 2DL, and 6B. Results of this study provide a benchmark for future efforts on QTL identification for yield traits.

AB Background: The goal of our study was a systematic survey of the molecular diversity in barley genetic resources. To this end 953 cultivated barley accessions originating from all inhabited continents except Australia were genotyped with 48 SSR markers. Molecular diversity was evaluated with routine statistics ( allelic richness, gene diversity, allele frequency, heterozygosity and unique alleles), Principal Coordinate Analysis ( PCoA), and analysis of genome- wide linkage disequilibrium.
   Results: A genotyping database for 953 cultivated barley accessions profiled with 48 SSR markers was established. The PCoA revealed structuring of the barley population with regard to ( i) geographical regions and ( ii) agronomic traits. Geographic origin contributed most to the observed molecular diversity. Genome- wide linkage disequilibrium ( LD) was estimated as squared correlation of allele frequencies ( r(2)). The values of LD for barley were comparable to other plant species ( conifers, poplar, maize). The pattern of intrachromosomal LD with distances between the genomic loci ranging from 1 to 150 cM revealed that in barley LD extended up to distances as long as 50 cM with r(2) > 0.05, or up to 10 cM with r(2) > 0.2. Few loci mapping to different chromosomes showed significant LD with r(2) > 0.05. The number of loci in significant LD as well as the pattern of LD were clearly dependent on the population structure. The LD in the homogenous group of 207 European 2- rowed spring barleys compared to the highly structured worldwide barley population was increased in the number of loci pairs with r(2) > 0.05 and had higher values of r2, although the percentage of intrachromosomal loci pairs in significant LD based on P < 0.001 was 100% in the whole set of varieties, but only 45% in the subgroup of European 2- rowed spring barleys. The value of LD also varied depending on the polymorphism of the loci selected for genotyping. The 17 most polymorphic loci ( PIC > 0.80) provided higher LD values as compared to 19 low polymorphic loci ( PIC < 0.73) in both structured ( all accessions) and non- structured ( European 2- rowed spring varieties) barley populations.
   Conclusion: A global population of cultivated barley accessions was highly structured. Clustering highlighted the accessions with the same geographic origin, as well as accessions possessing similar agronomic characters. LD in barley extended up to 50 cM, and was strongly dependent on the population structure. The data on LD were summarized as a genome- wide LD map for barley.

AB Implementation of marker assisted selection (MAS) in conventional breeding programs could allow assessment of the genetic potential of specific genotypes prior to their phenotypic evaluation. Furthermore, it could identify important trait alleles or marker-trait associations for further determination of a precise position for the loci of interest. Potential uses of microsatellite markers in molecular evaluation of bread-making quality was tested in a sample of 69 wheat genotypes that were genotyped with 3 microsatellites linked to previously mapped QTLs for loaf volume and Hagberg falling number on chromosome 3A. A total of 19 alleles were found, with an average of 6.33 alleles per loci, and average PIC value of 0.40. Specific SSR alleles were tested for association with bread-making related parameters. The association study approach, which uses statistical analysis of marker and phenotypic data, showed significant association of a specific allele at the GWM674 locus with Hagberg falling number in wheat.

AB Two monosomic alien substitution lines (MAS lines, 2n=41=40+5R) of wheat Triticum aestivum L. cv. 'Saratovskaya 29' were used as recipients in the development of inter-varietal substitution lines for chromosomes 5A and 5D. In the MAS lines, chromosomes 5A or 5D of 'Saratovskaya 29' were replaced by homoeologous univalent chromosome 5R of rye Secale cerale L. cv. 'Onokhoiskaya,' which bears the Hp marker gene coding for hairy peduncle. The donors included 18 spring and winter wheat varieties. The MAS lines were developed by crossing monosomic lines of 'Saratovskaya 29' for chromosomes 5A and 5D to a wheat-rye substitution line of 'Saratovskaya 29' 5R(5D) followed by cytological and morphological selection of plants with chromosome configuration 20II + 5RI in metaphase I of pollen mother cells from F-1 and F-2 plants with slightly hairy penduncles. It was shown that MAS lines could be maintained during long-term propagation (18 generations). Use of MAS lines with the Hp marker gene allows acceleration and abbreviation of cytological anaylsis and elimination of the probability of 'univalent switch' in the course of the development of subtitution lines. The method was applied to the development of 22 'Saratovskaya 29' lines with inter-varietal substitution for chromosomes 5A and 5D. Fourteen and thirteen microsatellite markers located in chromosomes 5A and 5D, respectively, were used to prove the authenticity of their inter-varietal substitution lines. According to these markers, 21 substitution from 22 studied were correct.

Twenty-one microsatellite primer pairs located on chromosome 5DS were screened; three polymorphic loci Xcfd81-5DS, Xgwm190-5DS, and Xcfd18-5DS were linked to Pm2 using an F-2 population from Chinese Spring x CI14118 (with Pm2) consisting of 814 individuals. The genetic distances between Pm2 and the three markers were: 2.0cM, 34.2cM and 44.2cM, respectively. Microsatellite marker Xcfd81-5DS could be used in marker assisted selection for Pm2 provided any chosen Pm2 source also carries the relevant marker.

AB Examining the relationships among DNA sequence, meiotic recombination, and chromosome structure at a genome-wide scale has been difficult because only a few markers connect genetic linkage maps with physical maps. Here, we have positioned 1195 genetically mapped expressed sequence tag (EST) markers onto the 10 pachytene chromosomes of maize by using a newly developed resource, the RN-cM map. The RN-cM map charts the distribution of crossing over ill the form of recombination nodules (RNs) along synaptonemal complexes (SCs, pachytene chromosomes) and allows genetic cM distances to be converted into physical micrometer distances on chromosomes. When this conversion is made, most of the EST markers Used in the study are located distally oil the chromosomes ill euchromatin. ESTs are significantly clustered on chromosomes, even when only euchromatic chromosomal segments are considered. Gene density and recombination rate (as measured by EST and RN frequencies, respectively) are strongly correlated. However, crossover frequencies for telomeric intervals are much higher than was expected from their EST frequencies. For pachytene chromosomes, EST density is about fourfold higher in euchromatin compared with heterochromatin, while DNA density is 1.4 times higher in heterochromatin than ill euchcromatin. Based oil DNA density values and the fraction of pachytene chromosome length that is euchromatic, we estimate that similar to 1500 Mbp of the maize genome is in euchromatin. This overview of the organization of the maize genome will be useful in examining genome and chromosome evolution in plants.

AB Dasypyrum breviaristatum and nine related species in Triticeae were analyzed using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, in order to understand the genetic relationship and to develop species specific markers. The genome relationship dendrogram shows that D. breviaristatum and D. villosum could not be grouped together, indicating that D. breviaristatum was unlikely to be directly derived from D. villosum, while D. breviaristatum was closest to Thinopyrum intermedium, which implied that they might have similar breeding behaviors when introducing their chromatins into wheat. A D. breviaristatum genome specific RAPD product of 1182bp, was cloned and designated as pDb12H. Sequence analysis revealed that pDb12H was strongly homologuos to a long terminal repeat (LTR) Sabrina retrotransposon newly reported in Hordeum. The pDb12H was converted into a PCR based marker, which allows effectively monitoring the D. breviaristatum chromatin introgression into wheat. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) suggested that pDb12H was specifically hybridized throughout all D. breviaristatum chromosomes arms except for the terminal and centromeric regions, which can be used to characterize wheat -D. breviaristatum chromosome translocation. The genomes repetitive element will also be useful to study gene interactions between the wheat and alien genomes after the polyploidization.

AB Rice, maize, sorghum, wheat, barley and the other major crop grasses from the family Poaceae (Gramineae) are mankind's most important source of calories and contribute tens of billions of dollars annually to the world economy (FAO 1999,http://www.fao.org; USDA 1997, http://www.usda.gov). Continued improvement of Poaceae crops is necessary in order to continue to feed an ever-growing world population. However, of the major crop grasses, only rice (Oryza sativa), with a compact genome of similar to 400 Mbp, has been sequenced and annotated. The Gramene database (http://www.gramene.org) takes advantage of the known genetic colinearity (synteny) between rice and the major crop plant genomes to provide maize, sorghum, millet, wheat, oat and barley researchers with the benefits of an annotated genome years before their own species are sequenced. Gramene is a one stop portal for finding curated literature, genetic and genomic datasets related to maps, markers, genes, genomes and quantitative trait loci. The addition of several new tools to Gramene has greatly facilitated the potential for comparative analysis among the grasses and contributes to our understanding of the anatomy, development, environmental responses and the factors influencing agronomic performance of cereal crops. Since the last publication on Gramene database by D. H. Ware, P. Jaiswal, J. Ni, I. V. Yap, X. Pan, K. Y. Clark, L. Teytelman, S. C. Schmidt, W. Zhao, K. Changet al. [(2002), Plant Physiol., 130, 1606-1613], the database has undergone extensive changes that are described in this publication.

AB The Chinese plant, "Packchul", (Atractylodes japonica. or A. macrocephala), is a very important Chinese medicinal herb plant and is called Sabju in Korea. The levels of the active components are different between these two species, but these medicines are sold in Korean herbal markets without discrimination. This study was carried out to develop a method that could be used to discriminate between A. japonica and A. macrocephala based on molecular markers. To discriminate between A.japonica and A. macrocephala, RAPD analyses were used to develop SCAR markers. Eighteen species-specific RAPD bands were obtained from 52 OPERON and URP primer sets. Two SCAR markers were developed from these RAPD clones. Both SCAR markers were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vectors and then subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis and designated AjR1 (1,117 bp) and AmR1 (1,325 bp). These two markers were sufficient to discriminate between samples of A. japonica and A. macrocephala.

AB The degree of aluminium tolerance varies widely across cereal species, with oats (Avena spp.) being among the most tolerant. The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to aluminium tolerance in the diploid oat A. strigosa. Restriction fragment length polymorphism markers were tested in regions where comparative mapping indicated the potential for orthologous quantitative trait loci (QTL) for aluminium tolerance in other grass species. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers were used to provide additional coverage of the genome. Four QTL were identified. The largest QTL explained 39% of the variation and is possibly orthologous to the major gene found in the Triticeae as well as Alm1 in maize and a minor gene in rice. A second QTL may be orthologous to the Alm2 gene in maize. Two other QTL were associated with anonymous markers. Together, these QTL accounted for 55% of the variation. A SCAR marker linked to the major QTL identified in this study could be used to introgress the aluminium tolerance trait from A. strigosa into cultivated oat germplasm.

AB The Argentinian wheat cultivar Sinvalocho MA carries the Lr3 gene for leaf rust resistance on distal chromosome 6BL. In this cultivar, 33 spontaneous susceptible lines were isolated and cytogenetically characterized by C-banding. The analysis revealed deletions on chromosome 6BL in most lines. One line was nulli-6B, two lines were ditelo 6BS, two, three, and ten lines had long terminal deletions of 40, 30, and 20%, respectively, three lines showed very small terminal deletions, and one line had an intercalary deletion of 11%. Physical mapping of 55 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers detected differences between deletions and led to the division of 6BL into seven bins delimited by deletion breakpoints. The most distal bin, with a length smaller than 5% of 6BL, contained 22 AFLP markers and the Lr3 gene. Polymorphism for nine AFLPs between Sinvalocho MA and the rust leaf susceptible cultivar Gamma 6 was used to construct a linkage map of Lr3. This gene is at a genetic distance of 0.9 cM from a group of seven closely linked AFLPs. The location of the gene in a high recombinogenic region indicated a physical distance of approximately 1 Mb to the markers.

AB The current view of wheat genome composition is that genes are compartmentalized into gene-rich and gene-poor regions. This model can be tested by analyzing randomly selected bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones for gene content, followed by placement of these BACs onto physical and genetic maps. Map localization could be difficult for BACs that consist entirely of repeated elements. We therefore developed a technique where repeat junctions are used to generate unique markers. Four BAC clones from hexaploid wheat variety Chinese Spring were randomly selected and sequenced at 4- to 6-fold redundancy. About 50% of the BAC sequences corresponded to previously identified repeats, mainly LTR-retrotransposons, whereas most of the remaining DNA consisted of sequences with unknown origin or function. The average gene content was < 1%, although each BAC contained one or two identified genes. Repeat boundaries were amplified and used to map each clone to a chromosome arm. Extrapolation from wheat-rice comparative knowledge suggests that three of the four BAC clones originate from "gene-rich" regions of the wheat genome. Nevertheless, because these BACs carry only a single gene (two BACs) or two genes (one BAC), the predicted gene density is approximate to 1 gene per 75 kb, which is considerably lower than previously estimated gene densities (one gene per 5-20 kb) for gene-rich regions in wheat. This analysis of randomly selected wheat BAC clones suggests that genes are more evenly distributed in wheat than previously believed and substantiates the need for large-scale random BAC sequencing to determine wheat genome organization.

AB Protoplasts of three Rosa cultivars were fused with each other, with protoplasts of Prunus 'Colt' and with protoplasts of Rubus laciniatus, using polyethylene glycol 4000 as a fusogen. Protoplasts of Prunus were incapable of cell division and those of Rosa and Rubus were disabled by treatments with metabolic inhibitors, either iodoacetate (IOA) or rhodamine 6-G (R6G). Parental protoplasts were then fused in combinations that required complementation for their survival. RAPD analysis of 41 fusion-derived cell lines showed that two lines resulting from fusions of Rosa + Rosa and one from a fusion of Rosa + Prunus, contained some DNA markers from both fusion partners. The others contained markers of only one fusion parent. This showed that after protoplast fusion, the heterokaryons did not develop into cell lines with stable hybrid nuclei. Plants regenerated from cell lines derived from Rosa + Prunus and Rosa + Rubus fusions contained DNA markers of only Rosa and their DNA amounts were no greater than that of the Rosa parent. However, they differed morphologically from the Rosa parent to a remarkable degree, possibly because they inherited undetected genes of Prunus or Rubus, or because they were somaclonal variants of the Rosa parent. Alternative strategies for the production of somatic hybrids are discussed.

AB Heading date is an important trait that determines wheat adaptation to environments. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from CI 13227 x Suwon 92 was employed to tag the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for early heading in Suwon 92. This population was phenotyped for heading date in 1994, 1995, and 1997, and analyzed with AFLP and SSR markers. Two AFLP markers (XGCTG.CGCT118 and XGCTG.CGCT60) closely associated with heading date were identified. Across years, XGCTG.CGCT118 and XGCTG.CGCT60 explained 40.4% and 32.2% of the total phenotypic variances, respectively. Interval analysis revealed a major QTL for heading date, designated QHd.pser-2DS, between AFLP marker XGCTG.CGCT118 and SSR marker Xgwm261. Based on the linkage map, QHd.pser-2DS was about 41.2 cM proximal to the distal end of chromosome 2DS, and explained 40.5% of the phenotypic variance across three years. The identified markers associated with the early heading QTL have the potential to be used in wheat breeding programs.

AB A hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed for cloning Yr5 and other genes conferring resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici). Intact nuclei from a Yr5 near-isogenic line were used to isolate high molecular weight DNA, which was partially cleaved with HindIII and cloned into pECBAC1 and pIndigoBAC-5 vectors. The wheat BAC library consisted of 422 400 clones arrayed in 1100 micro-titer plates (each plate with 384 wells). Random sampling of 300 BAC clones indicated an average insert size of 140 kb, with a size range from 25 to 365 kb. Ninety percent of the clones in the library had an insert size greater than 100 kb and fewer than 5% of the clones did not contain inserts. Based on an estimated genome size of 15 966 Mb for hexaploid wheat, the BAC library was estimated to have a total coverage of 3.58x wheat genome equivalents, giving approximately 96% probability of identifying a clone representing any given wheat DNA sequence. Twelve BAC clones containing an Yr5 locus-specific marker (Yr5STS7/8) were successfully selected by PCR screening of 3-dimensional BAC pools. The results demonstrated that the T. aestivum BAC library is a valuable genomic resource for positional cloning of Yr5. The library also should be useful in cloning other genes for stripe rust resistance and other traits of interest in hexaploid wheat.

AB Forage kochia (Kochia prostrata ssp. virescens 'Immigrant' is native to the arid and semiarid regions of central Eurasia. It was introduced into the United States in 1966 as PI 314929 and released as a perennial forage shrub in 1984. Kochia americana is a perennial native to the United States, whereas Kochia scorparia is an introduced annual species that became a weed. To assess both the breeding potential and the possibility of genetic contamination, relationships among the 3 Kochia species were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, sequence tagged site (STS) marker sequences of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase gene (ndhF), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (MC-FISH). Seventy decamer random primers yielded 458 polymorphic bands from 9 plants of K. americana, 20 plants of K. prostrata, and 7 plants of K. scoparia. Fifty-four and 55 species-specific RAPD markers were identified for K. americana and K. prostrata, whereas 80 RAPD markers were specific to K. scoparia. Based on the presence or absence of informative RAPD markers, the 3 species always grouped into 3 distinct clusters in a NTSYSpc2.01b-generated dendrogram. The same relationships were found among the 3 Kochia species based on ndhF DNA sequence divergence. Using a set of 7 STS markers that can identify each Kochia species, we did not find a single interspecific hybrid from artificial hybridizations among the 3 Kochia species. In GISH studies, chromosomes of 1 species fluoresced in green only when they were probed by genomic DNA of the same species. Cross-hybridization by genomic DNA of another species was not observed. In FISH studies using pTa71 (for 18S-5.8S-26S rDNAs) and pScT7 (for 5S rDNA) as probes, there were 1, 1 and 3 pTa71 sites and 2, 1, and 1 pScT7 sites in each haplome of K. prostrata, K. americana, and K. scoparia, respectively. It is concluded that these 3 Kochia species are so genomically distinct that gene introgression among them would be extremely rare.

AB Eleven polymorphic microsatellite loci and one minisatellite locus originating from expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries of Phaeosphaeria (syn. Stagonospora) nodorum were isolated and characterized. The satellite markers were used to genotype isolates from field populations collected in China, North America and South Africa. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 15. Genotype diversity ranged from 87.5 to 95.3 and gene diversity from 0.1 to 0.8. The variable levels of polymorphism within and among populations of P. nodorum renders these 12 satellite loci ideal markers for population genetic analysis of P. nodorum.

AB Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] is one of the major insect pests of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Hessian fly resistance gene H9 was previously reported to condition resistance to Hessian fly biotype L that is prevalent in many wheat-growing areas of eastern USA and an RAPD marker, OPO05(1000), linked to H9 in wheat was developed using wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs). However, marker-assisted selection (MAS) with RAPD markers is not always feasible. One of the objectives in this study was to convert an RAPD marker linked to the gene H9 into a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker to facilitate MAS and to map H9 in the wheat genome. The RAPD fragment from OPO05(1000) was cloned, sequenced, and converted into a SCAR marker SOPO05(909), whose linkage relationship with H9 was subsequently confirmed in two F-2 populations segregating for H9. Linkage analysis identified one sequence tagged site (STS) marker, STS-Pm3, and the eight microsatellite markers Xbarc263, Xcfa2153, Xpsp2999, Xgwm136, Xgdm33, Xcnl76, Xcnl117 and Xwmc24 near the H9 locus on the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 1A, contrary to the previously reported location of H9 on chromosome 5A. Locus Xbarc263 was 1.2 cM distal to H9, which itself was 1.7 cM proximal to loci Xcfa2153, Xpsp2999 and Xgwm136. The loci Xgwm136, Xcfa2153 and SOPO05(909) were shown to be specific to H9 and not diagnostic to several other Hessian fly resistance genes, and therefore should be useful for pyramiding H9 with other Hessian fly resistance genes in a single genotype.

AB Wheat cultivar Jing 411 which is susceptible to powdery mildew, and wheat cultivar Brock and NILs of Jing 411, which are resistant to powdery mildew were analysized for polymophisms using 213 random amplified polymorphic DNA primers. Only one primer (S2092) stably produced a polymorphic band between the resistant and susceptible plants. Linkage analysis of this marker (S2092(972)) revealed that the polymorphism existed in a 131 F-2 segregating population. S2092(972) was closely linked to a powdery mildew resistance gene in wheat cultivar Brock, at a linkage distance was 4.9 cM. S209(972), was converted to sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers SCAR(860) and SCAR(200). The two SCAR markers were used for detecting F-2 segregating population. SCAR(860) and SCAR(200) existed in resistant plants but were absent in the susceptible plants. We concluded that S2092(972) was located on the chromosome 3BL. These markers will be useful for marker-assisted selection and gene pyramiding in wheat resistance breeding.

AB To assess the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of Turkish wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum Tell.) populations, 76 genotypes from ten ecologically and geographically different locations were analyzed by means of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Five primer combinations produced 187 scorable bands, of which 117 (62.6%) were polymorphic. Several population-specific and genotype-specific bands were identified, which differentiate populations or genotypes. Genetic distance, determined by Nei's distance coefficient, varied from 0.07 to 0.21 with an average of 0.13. In the UPGMA dendrogram based on Nei genetic distances, the Hordeum spontaneum populations were separated into two major clusters. Genetic diversity was larger among (68%) than within (32%) populations. Eight AFLP bands were strongly correlated to the altitude of the collecting site, while no clear trend was detected between geographical origin and genetic diversity. Our results strongly suggest the need for a change in Hordeum spontaneum sampling strategy: more populations, rather then more individuals within population, should be sampled to appraise and safeguard genetic diversity in the wild barley gene pool.

AB The stem, leaf and stripe rust resistance genes Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9, located on the short arm of rye chromosome 1, have been widely used in wheat by means of wheat-rye translocation chromosomes. Previous studies have suggested that these resistance specificities are encoded by either closely-linked genes, or by a single gene capable of recognizing all three rust species. To investigate these issues, two 1BL center dot 1RS wheat lines, one with and one without Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9, were used as parents for a high-resolution F2 mapping family. Thirty-six recombinants were identified between two PCR markers 2.3 cM apart that flanked the resistance locus. In one recombinant, Lr26 was separated from Sr31 and Yr9. Mutation studies recovered mutants that separated all three rust resistance genes. Thus, together, the recombination and mutation studies suggest that Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9 are separate closely-linked genes. An additional 16 DNA markers were mapped in this region. Multiple RFLP markers, identified using part of the barley Mla powdery mildew resistance gene as probe, co-segregated with Sr31 and Yr9. One deletion mutant that had lost Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9 retained all Mla markers, suggesting that the family of genes on 1RS identified by the Mla probe does not contain the Sr31, Lr26 or Yr9 genes. The genetic stocks and DNA markers generated from this study should facilitate the future cloning of Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9.

AB Genetic improvement of aluminum (Al) tolerance is one of the cost-effective solutions to improve wheat (Triticum aestivum) productivity in acidic soils. The objectives of the present study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Al-tolerance and associated PCR-based markers for marker-assisted breeding utilizing cultivar Atlas 66. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Atlas 66/Century was screened for Al-tolerance by measuring root-growth rate during Al treatment in hydroponics and root response to hematoxylin stain of Al treatment. After 797 pairs of SSR primers were screened for polymorphisms between the parents, 131 pairs were selected for bulk segregant analysis (BSA). A QTL analysis based on SSR markers revealed one QTL on the distal region of chromosome arm 4DL where a malate transporter gene was mapped. This major QTL accounted for nearly 50% of the phenotypic variation for Al-tolerance. The SSR markers Xgdm125 and Xwmc331 were the flanking markers for the QTL and have the potential to be used for high-throughput, marker-assisted selection in wheat-breeding programs.

One hundred and forty-four Sse8387I/MseI and 32 EcoRI/MseI primer combinations were used to obtain 95 Thinopyrum-specific AFLP markers. The physical map confirmed that terminal deletions had mostly occurred, however, it appears that intercalary deletions and primer or restriction site mutations were also induced. The markers allowed for grouping of the deletion mutant lines into 19 clusters, with 7 AFLP markers mapping in the same marker bin as Lr19. Primary and secondary Lr19 allosyndetic recombinants were subsequently physically mapped employing AFLP, RFLP, SCAR and microsatellite markers and the data integrated with the deletion map. A further shortened, tertiary Lr19 recombinant was derived following homologous recombination between the proximally shortest secondary recombinant, Lr19-149-299, and distally shortest recombinant, Lr19-149-478. The tertiary recombinant could be confirmed employing the mapped markers and it was possible to identify new markers on this recombinant that can be used to reduce the translocation still further.

AB The genus Zoysia consists of 16 species that are naturally distributed on sea coasts and grasslands around the Pacific. Of these, Zoysia japonica, Zoysia matrella, and Zoysia tenuifolia are grown extensively as turfgrasses, and Z. japonica is also used as forage grass in Japan and other countries in East Asia. To develop simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.), we used four SSR-enriched genomic libraries to isolate 1,163 unique SSR clones. All four libraries contained a high percentage of perfect clones, ranging from 67.1 to 96.0%, and compound clones occurred with higher frequencies in libraries A (28.6%) and D (11.6%). From these clones, we developed 1,044 SSR markers when we tested all 1,163 SSR primer pairs. Using all 1,044 SSR markers, we tested one screening panel consisting of eight Zoysia clones for testing PCR amplifications, from which five unrelated clones, among the eight, were used for polymorphism assessment, and found that the polymorphic information content ranged from 0 (monomorphic loci) to 0.88. Of the 1,044 SSR markers, 170 were segregated in our mapping population and we mapped 161 on existing amplified fragment length polymorphism-based linkage groups, using this mapping population. These SSR markers will provide an ideal marker system to assist with gene targeting, quantitative trait locus mapping, variety or species identification, and marker-assisted selection in Zoysia species.

AB The alpha-subunit of the casein protein kinase CK2 has been implicated in both light-regulated and circadian rhythm-controlled plant gene expression, including control of the flowering time. Two putative CK2 alpha genes of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) have been obtained from a cDNA library constructed with mRNA isolated from cold-acclimated crown tissue. The genomic organisation of the two genes was determined by Southern hybridisation analysis. Primer designs to the Lpck2a-1 and Lpck2a-2 cDNA sequences permitted the amplification of genomic products containing large intron sequences. Amplicon sequence analysis detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the p150/112 reference mapping population. Validated SNPs, within diagnostic restriction enzyme sites, were used to design cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) assays. The Lpck2a-1 CAPS marker was assigned to perennial ryegrass linkage group (LG) 4 and the Lpck2a-2 CAPS marker was assigned to LG2. The location of the Lpck2a-1 gene locus supports the previous conclusion of conserved synteny between perennial ryegrass LG4, the Triticeae homoeologous group 5L chromosomes and the corresponding segment of rice chromosome 3. Allelic variation at the Lpck2a-1 and Lpck2a-2 gene loci was correlated with phenotypic variation for heading date and winter survival, respectively. SNP polymorphism may be used for the further study of the role of CK2 alpha genes in the initiation of reproductive development and winter hardiness in grasses.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), is a serious economic pest of wheat (Triticum aestimin L.) worldwide. Although resistant wheat cultivars provide good control of RWA, genetic characterization is critical to the continual use of aphid-resistance genes. The objective of this study was to determine the chromosome location and the genetic relationships of the RWA-resistance genes Dn1, Dn2, Dn4, Dn5, Dn6, Dnx, and several uncharacterized Dn genes. Molecular mapping demonstrated that Dn genes in four uncharacterized wheat lines (PI 47545, PI 222666, PI 222668, and PI 225245) as well as DO, Dn2, Dn5, Dn6, and Dnx are tightly linked to microsatellite markers Xgwm44 and Xgwm111. Deletion bin mapping assigned Xgwm44 physically in the region distal to the breakpoints 7DS-4 (FL 0.61) and Xgwm111 distal to 7DS-5 (FL 0.36) of wheat chromosome arm 7DS. Allelism tests detected no segregation for susceptibility among TC1F1 plants from the test crosses or among F-2 plants derived from intercrosses between wheat lines containing each of these known Dn genes. Both marker-linkage analyses and allelism tests revealed that all these Dn genes are clustered in a region linked to Xgwm111 and are either alleles of a single locus or are closely related members of a Dn gene family. Dn4 and the uncharacterized Dn gene in PI151918 are either allelic or linked on wheat chromosome 1DS. The linked markers and genetic relationships of these Dn genes will greatly facilitate their use in wheat breeding and the deployment of aphid-resistant cultivars.

AB Microsatellite profiles of 47 melon cultivars and landraces were analyzed and compared to the aDNA (ancient DNA) of seed remains from an extinct sample recovered from the 15th century (Budapest, Hungary). An aseptic incubation followed by ITS (internal transcribed spacer) analysis was used to exclude the exogenously and endogenously contaminated medieval seeds and to detect SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) in ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA (ribosomal DNA). SNPs were observed at the 94-95 bp (GC to either RC, RS or AG) of ITS1; and at 414 bp (A-to-T substitution), 470 bp (T to Y or C), 610 bp (A to R or G) and 633 bp (A-to-G transition) of ITS2. For comparative microsatellite analysis SSRs (simple sequence repeats) detected by ALF (automated laser fluorometer) was used. Eight of the 20 SSR primer pairs amplified 40 microsatellite alleles in identical fragment ranges. A total of 485 alleles were detected in the 47 melon cultivars. The number of alleles per marker ranged from 2 to 7 with an average of 5.7 including CMCT44 (2 alleles), CMAG59 (5 alleles), CMGA104 (5 alleles), CMCT134 (4 alleles), CMTA134 (6 alleles), CMCTT144 (7 alleles), CMTC168 (6 alleles) and CMCT170 (5 alleles). Sequence analysis of the microsatellite alleles showed different fragment lengths depending on changes in the number of unit of core sequences. Dendrogram produced by SPSS11 based on the presence versus absence of SSR alleles revealed that medieval melon had the closest genetic similarity to a registered melon cultivar Hogolyo selected from an old Hungarian melon landrace. These results also indicated that cloned DNA sequences recovered from aDNA of medieval melon can be of use for molecular breeding of modern melon cultivars via gene transfer.

AB There is an increasing amount of public sequence information for the main cultivated cereals, such as wheat and barley. It is not foreseeable that comparable efforts or resources could be devoted to related wild species. However, wild species are interesting sources of genetic variation through introgression breeding. Comparative genomics can be a helpful approach to make use of the available genomic resources. In this context, the potential of the wild barley species Hordeum chilense has been explored in recent years. It exhibits great levels of polymorphism and high crossability with different cereal genera. In addition, interesting biotic and abiotic stress resistance genes, and important quality traits like carotene content and seed storage protein variability shown in the species are also expressed in wheat backgrounds, and are the basis of a breeding program. Different approaches have been undertaken for tagging H. chilense genomic regions in a wheat background. The search for the most suitable DNA marker system started with the development of RAPD and SCAR markers due to a lack of sequence information from the wild species. Transferability of markers from wheat and barley (like STSs or SSRs) have also been useful approximations. More recently, SNP development is being accomplished for the species. In this work, the situation and prospects with the available molecular tools are considered from a practical point of view.

AB To improve rust resistance of bunching onion (Allium fistulosum L.), we applied a recurrent selection program by using six cultivars (Co): 'Seito Ippon', 'Iwai 2', 'Choju', 'Senami', 'Fuyuogi Ippon' and 'Toyokawa Futo'. Each cycle of recurrent selection consisted of two steps: selfing and selection among selfed progenies in the first year, and intercrossing and maternal-line selection in the second year. A second-cycle improved population (C-2), consisting of 10 maternal lines, was obtained by two cycles of recurrent selection. Furthermore, we conducted two generations of selfing and progeny selection, and obtained 13 C2S2 lines. To evaluate the effectiveness of this recurrent selection, we conducted two rounds of simultaneous inoculation tests and compared the rust resistance of all generations obtained in the selection program. Under inoculation tests in the spring and autumn, the value of the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), an index of disease intensity, definitely decreased with the progress of recurrent selection. Although the resistance gain from C-1 to C-2 was small, much progress was made in the C2S2 generation; the AUDPC in C2S2 lines was approximately 38% of that in the initial parental cultivars. Our results demonstrate that recurrent selection is effective in improving the rust resistance of bunching onion.

AB Several wheat lines and cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum) originating from the southwestern region of China were found to be highly resistant to stripe rust by inoculation with the prevalent races (CYR30, CYR31, and CYR32) and newly emerged races (H46-4, SY11-4 and SY11-14) of the pathogen. An inheritance study of the resistance to stripe rust was carried out by crossing resistant AIM6 with susceptible BeiZ76. Results indicated that the resistance to stripe rust was controlled by a single dominant gene. The 112 F-2 plants chosen from the cross BeiZ76/ AIM6 were analyzed with 218 pairs of microsatellite primers to determine the map location of the resistance gene. A simple sequence repeat marker on chromosome arm 2BS, Xgwm410, showed polymorphism and co-segregation between stripe rust resistant and susceptible plants. From the pedigree, inheritance, molecular marker, and resistance response, it is concluded that the stripe rust resistance gene in wheat cv. Chuan-nong19 (CN19) and wheat lines AIM5 and AIM6 is a novel gene, designated YrCN19. The microsatellite primer Xgwm410 is a diagnostic marker of the resistance gene YrCN19, which has potential for application in the marker-assisted breeding of wheat.

AB A gene (temporarily designated Hdic) conferring resistance to the Hessian fly (Hf) [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] was previously identified from an accession of German cultivated emmer wheat [Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum (Schrank ex Schubler) Thell] PI 94641, and was transferred to the Hf- resistant wheat germplasm KS99WGRC42. The inheritance of Hdic resistance exhibited incomplete penetrance because phenotypes of some heterozygous progenies are fully resistant and the others are fully susceptible. Five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (Xgwm136,Xcfa2153, Xpsp2999,Xgwm33, and Xbarc263) were linked to the Hdic gene on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A in the same region as the H9, H10, and H11 loci. Flanking markers Xgwm33 and Xcfa2153 were mapped at distances 0.6 cM proximal and 1.4 cM distal, respectively. Marker analysis revealed that a very small intercalary chromosomal segment containing Hdic was transferred from emmer wheat to KS99WGRC42. This is the first emmer-derived Hf-resistance gene that has been mapped and characterized. The Hdic gene confers a high level of antibiosis to biotypes GP and L, as well as to strains vH9 and vH13 of the Hf, which is different from the biotype reaction patterns of the known Hf-resistance genes on chromosome 1A (H5 and H11 susceptible to biotype L, H9 and H10 susceptible to strain vH9). These results suggested that Hdic is either a new gene or a novel allele of a known H gene on chromosome 1A. The broad spectrum of resistance conferred by the Hdic gene makes it valuable for developing Hf resistant wheat cultivars.

AB Introgression from allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L., AABBDD) to allotetraploid jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host, CCDD) can take place in areas where the two species grow in sympatry and hybridize. Wheat and Ae. cylindrica share the D genome, issued from the common diploid ancestor Aegilops tauschii Coss. It has been proposed that the A and B genome of bread wheat are secure places to insert transgenes to avoid their introgression into Ae. cylindrica because during meiosis in pentaploid hybrids, A and B genome chromosomes form univalents and tend to be eliminated whereas recombination takes place only in D genome chromosomes. Wheat random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments, detected in intergeneric hybrids and introgressed to the first backcross generation with Ae. cylindrica as the recurrent parent and having a euploid Ae. cylindrica chromosome number or one supernumerary chromosome, were assigned to wheat chromosomes using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic wheat lines. Introgressed fragments were not limited to the D genome of wheat, but specific fragments of A and B genomes were also present in the BC1. Their presence indicates that DNA from any of the wheat genomes can introgress into Ae. cylindrica. Successfully located RAPD fragments were then converted into highly specific and easy-to-use sequence characterised amplified regions (SCARs) through sequencing and primer design. Subsequently these markers were used to characterise introgression of wheat DNA into a BC1S1 family. Implications for risk assessment of genetically modified wheat are discussed.

AB Improved resistance to preharvest sprouting in modern bread wheat (Triticum aestivum. L.) can be achieved via the introgression of grain dormancy and would reduce both the incidence and severity of damage due to unfavourable weather at harvest. The dormancy phenotype is strongly influenced by environmental factors making selection difficult and time consuming and this trait an obvious candidate for marker assisted selection. A highly significant Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) associated with grain dormancy and located on chromosome 4A was identified in three bread wheat genotypes, two white- and one red-grained, of diverse origin. Flanking SSR markers on either side of the putative dormancy gene were identified and validated in an additional population involving one of the dormant genotypes. Genotypes containing the 4A QTL varied in dormancy phenotype from dormant to intermediate dormant. Based on a comparison between dormant red- and white-grained genotypes, together with a white-grained mutant derived from the red-grained genotype, it is concluded that the 4A QTL is a critical component of dormancy; associated with at least an intermediate dormancy on its own and a dormant phenotype when combined with the R gene in the red-grained genotype and as yet unidentified gene(s) in the white-grained genotypes. These additional genes appeared to be different in AUS1408 and SW95-50213.

AB Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in plants is usually conducted using a population derived from a cross between two inbred lines. The power of such QTL detection and the estimation of the effects highly depend on the choice of the two parental lines. Thus, the QTL found represent only a small part of the genetic architecture and can be of limited economical interest in marker-assisted selection. On the other hand, applied breeding programmes evaluate large numbers of progeny derived from multiple-related crosses for a wide range of agronomic traits. It is assumed that the development of statistical techniques to deal with pedigrees in existing plant populations would increase the relevance and cost effectiveness of QTL mapping in a breeding context. In this study, we applied a two-step IBD-based-variance component method to a real wheat breeding population, composed of 374 F-6 lines derived from 80 different parents. Two bread wheat quality related traits were analysed by the method. Results obtained show very close agreement with major genes and QTL already known for those two traits. With this new QTL mapping strategy, inferences about QTL can be drawn across the breeding programme rather than being limited to the sample of progeny from a single cross and thus the use of the detected QTL in assisting breeding would be facilitated.

AB A powdery mildew resistance gene from Triticum urartu Tum. accession UR206 was successfully transferred into hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through crossing and backcrossing. The F-1 plants, which had 28 chromosomes and an average of 5.32 bivalents and 17.36 univalents in meiotic pollen mother cells (PMC), were obtained through embryos rescued owing to shriveling of endosperm in hybrid seed of cross Chinese Spring (CS) x UR206. Hybrid seeds were produced through backcrossing F-1 with common wheat parents. The derivative lines had normal chromosome numbers and powdery mildew resistance similar to the donor UR206, indicating that the powdery mildew resistance gene originating from T. urartu accession UR206 was successfully transferred and expressed in a hexaploid wheat background. Genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene controlled the powdery mildew resistance at the seedling stage. To map and tag the powdery mildew resistance gene, 143 F-2 individuals derived from a cross UR206 x UR203 were used to construct a linkage map. The resistant gene was mapped on the chromosome 7AL based on the mapped microsatellite makers. The map spanned 52.1 cM and the order of these microsatellite loci agreed well with the established microsatellite map of chromosome arm 7AL. The resistance gene was flanked by the microsatellite loci Xwmc273 and Xpsp3003, with the genetic distances of 2.2 cM and 3.8 cM, respectively. On the basis of the origin and chromosomal location of the gene, it was temporarily designated PmU.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most destructive diseases in wheat. This study was to identify new quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance and the molecular markers closely linked to the QTL in wheat cultivar Chokwang. The primers of 612 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 12 target-region-amplified polymorphism (TRAP) marker were analyzed between resistant (Chokwang) and susceptible (Clark) parents. One hundred and seventy-two polymorphic markers were used to screen a population of 79 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Chokwang and Clark. One major QTL, Qfhb.ksu-5DL1, was identified on chromosome 5DL. The SSR marker Xbarc 239 was mapped in the QTL region, and also physically located to the bin of 5DL1-0.60-0.74 by using Chinese Spring deletion lines. Another QTL Qfhb.ksu-4BL1was linked to SSR Xbarc 1096 and tentatively mapped on 4BL. A QTL on 3BS, Qfhb.ksu-3BS1, was also detected with marginal significance in this population. Different marker alleles for these QTL were detected between Chokwang and Sumai 3 and its derivatives. These results suggested that Chokwang contains new QTL for FHB resistance that are different from those in Sumai 3. Pyramiding resistance QTL from various sources may enhance FHB resistance in wheat cultivars.

AB Fusarium head blight of wheat is a major deterrent to wheat production world-wide. The genetics of FHB resistance in wheat are becoming clear and there is a good understanding of the genome location of FHB resistance QTL from different sources such as Sumai3, Wuhan, Nyubai and Frontana. All the components needed for assembling complex genotypes through large-scale molecular breeding experiments are now available. This experiment used high throughput microsatellite genotyping and half-seed analysis to process four independent crosses through a molecular breeding strategy to introduce multiple pest resistance genes into Canadian wheat. This included two backcrosses and selection for a total of six FHB resistance QTL, orange blossom wheat midge resistance (Sm1) and leaf rust resistance (Lr21). In addition, the fixation of the elite genetic background was monitored with 45-76 markers to accelerate restoration of the genetic background at each backcross. The strategy resulted in 87% fixation of the elite genetic background on average at the BC2F1 generation and successfully introduced all of the chromosome segments containing FHB, Sm1 and Lr21 resistance genes. The molecular breeding strategy was completed in 25 months, at an equal pace to conventional crossing and selection of spring wheat.

AB The rapidly growing expressed sequence tag (EST) resources of species representing the Poacea family and availability of comprehensive sequence information for the rice (Oryza sativa) genome create an excellent opportunity for comparative genome analysis. Extensive synteny between rice chromosome 1 and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome 3 has proven extremely useful for saturation mapping of chromosomal regions containing target genes of large-genome barley with conserved orthologous genes from the syntenic regions of the rice genome. Rph5 is a gene conferring resistance to the barley leaf rust pathogen Puccinia hordei. It was mapped to chromosome 3HS, which is syntenic with rice chromosome 1S. The objective of this study was to increase marker density within the sub-centimorgan region around Rph5, using sequence-tagged site (STS) markers that were developed based on barley ESTs syntenic to the phage (P1)-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones comprising the distal region of rice chromosome 1S. Five rice PAC clones were used as queries in a blastn search to screen 375,187 barley ESTs. Ninety-four non-redundant EST sequences were identified from the EST database and used as templates to design 174 pairs of primer combinations. As a result, 9 barley EST-based STS markers were incorporated into the 'Bowman' x 'Magnif 102' high-resolution map of the Rph5 region. More importantly, six markers, including five EST-derived STS sequences, were found to co-segregate with Rph5. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of rice genomic resources for efficient deployment of barley ESTs for marker saturation of targeted barley genomic regions.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance was evaluated in a set of recombinant inbred (RI) lines from a cross between Russia 6 (resistant) and H.E.S. 4 (susceptible), which had one of the widest differences of FHB resistance reactions among ca. 5,000 barley germplasm accessions in Okayama University. Field-grown spikes were sampled and inoculated by the 'cut-spike test'. Resistance reactions on the parents and RI lines were scored by eleven grades, from resistant (0) to susceptible (10). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis detected three QTL: two located on the long arm of chromosome 2H, and another on the short arm of chromosome 5H. A QTL located on chromosome 2H was coincident with the vrs1 locus, which governs inflorescence row type. The other QTL on chromosome 2H was positioned in the vicinity of cleistogamy locus (cly1 or Cly2) that determines inflorescence opening/closing. Resistant gene analog (RGA) and expressed sequence tag (EST) markers with homology for disease resistance genes were integrated into the high-density linkage map. Most of these markers were not localized near the identified resistance QTL, except for one RGA marker (FXLRRfor_XLRRrev170) localized in the vicinity of the cly1/Cly2 locus. Five AFLP markers localized in the vicinity of the identified QTL were sequenced to convert them into sequence tagged site (STS) markers. Genotyping of each RI line using two AFLP-STS markers and the vrs1 locus indicated that the RI lines with three Russia 6 QTL alleles exhibited the same level of high FHB resistance reactions as Russia 6. In contrast, RI lines with three susceptible alleles showed reactions close to H.E.S. 4. Therefore, the markers closely linked to the QTL can be efficiently used for the selection of resistance.

AB The major aluminum (M) tolerance gene in wheat ALMTI confers an Al-activated efflux of malate from root apices. We determined the genomic structure of the ALMTI gene and found it consists of 6 exons interrupted by 5 introns. Sequencing a range of wheat genotypes identified 3 alleles for ALMT1. I of which was identical to the ALMT1 gene from an Aegilops tauschii accession. The ALMT1 gene was mapped to chromosome 4DL using 'Chinese Spring' deletion lines, and loss of ALMT1 coincided with the loss of both Al tolerance and Al-activated malate efflux. Aluminium tolerance in each of 5 different doubled-haploid populations was found to be conditioned by a single major gene. When ALMT1 was polymorphic between the parental lines, QTL and linkage analyses indicated that ALMT1 mapped to chromosome 4DL and cosegregated with Al tolerance. In 2 populations examined. Al tolerance also segregated with a greater capacity for Al-activated rnalate efflux. Aluminium tolerance was not associated with a particular coding allele for ALMT1, but was significantly correlated with the relative level of ALMT1 expression. These findings suggest that the Al tolerance in a diverse range of wheat genotypes is primarily conditioned by ALMT1.

AB Lophopyrum elongatitin, a close relative of wheat. provides a source of novel genes for wheat improvement. Molecular markers were developed to monitor the introgression of L. elongatum chromosome segments into hexaploid wheat. Existing simple sequence repeats (SSRs) derived from genomic libraries were initially screened for detecting L. elongotum loci in wheat, but only 6 of the 163 markers tested were successful. To increase detection of L. elongatum specific loci, 165 SSRs were identified from wheat expressed sequence taus (ESTs), where their chromosomal positions in wheat were known from deletion bin mapping. Detailed sequence analysis identified 41 SSRs within this group as potentially superior in their ability to detect L. elongation loci. BLASTN alignments were used to position primers within regions of the ESTs that have sequence conservation with at least I similar EST from another cereal species. The targeting of primers in this manner enabled 14 L. elongatum markers from 41 wheat ESTs to be identified, whereas only 2 from 124 primers designed in random positions flanking SSRs detected L. elongatum loci. Addition and ditelosomic lines were used to assign all 22 markers to specific chromosome locations in L. elongatitin. Nine of these SSR markers were assigned to hornoeologeous chromosome locations based on their similar position in hexaploid wheat. The remaining markers mapped to other L. elongatum chromosomes indicating a degree of chromosome rearrangements, paralogous sequences and (or) sequence variation between the 2 species. The EST-SSR markers were also used to screen other wheatgrass species indicating further chromosome rearrangements and (or) sequence variation between wheatgrass genomes. This study details methodologies for the generation of SSRs for detecting L. elongatum loci.

AB An Aegilops umbellulata-derived leaf-rust-resistance gene, Lr9, was tagged with 3 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, which mapped within 1.8 cM of gene Lr9 located on chromosome 6BL of wheat. The markers were identified in an F,, population segregating for leaf-rust resistance, which was generated from a cross between 2 near-isogenic lines that differed in the alien gene Lr9 in a widely adopted agronomic background of cultivar 'HD 2329'. Disease phenotyping was done in controlled environmental conditions by inoculating the population with the most virulent pathotype, 121 R63-1 of Puccinia triticina. One RAPD marker, S5(550), located at a distance of 0.8 +/- 0.008 cM from the Lr9 locus, was converted to sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker SCS5(550). The SCAR marker was validated for its specificity to gene Lr9 against 44 of the 50 known Lr genes and 10 wheat cultivars possessing the gene Lr9. Marker SCS5(550) was used with another SCAR marker, SCS73(719), previously identified as being linked to gene Lr24 on a segregating F-2 population to select for genes Lr9 and Lr24. respectively, demonstrating the utility of the 2 markers in marker-assisted gene pyramiding for leaf-rust resistance in wheat.

AB Relatively little is known about the genetic control of agronomic traits in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) compared with traits that follow Mendelian segregation patterns. A doubled-haploid population was generated from the cross RL4452 x 'AC Domain' to study the inheritance of the agronomic traits: plant height, time to maturity, lodging, grain yield, test weight, and 1000-grain weight. This cross includes the genetics of 2 western Canadian wheat marketing classes. Composite interval mapping was conducted with a microsatellite linkage map, incorporating 369 loci, and phenotypic data from multiple Manitoba environments. The plant height quantitative trait loci (QTLs), QHt.crc-4B and QHt.crc-4D, mapped to the expected locations of Rht-B1 and Rht-D1. These QTLs were responsible for most of the variation in plant height and were associated with other agronomic traits. An additional 25 agronomic QTLs were detected in the RL4452 x 'AC Domain' population beyond those associated with QHt.crc-4B and QHt.crc4D. 'AC Domain' contributed 4 alleles for early maturity, including a major time to maturity QTL on 7D. RL4452 contributed 2 major alleles for increased grain yield at QY1d.crc-2B and QY1d.crc-4A, which are potential targets for marker-assisted selection. A key test weight QTL was detected on 3B and prominent 1000-grain weight QTLs were identified on 3D and 4A.

AB The enzyme activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in grain has been related to undersirable brown discoloration of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based end-products, particularly for Asian noodles. Breeding wheat cultivars with low PPO activity is the best approach to reduce the undesirable darkening. Molecular markers could greatly improve selection efficiency in breeding programs. Based on the sequences of PPO genes (GenBank Accession Numbers AY596268, AY596269 and AY596270) conditioning PPO activity during kernel development, 28 pairs of primers were designed using the software 'DNAMAN'. One of the markers from AY596268, designated as PPO18, can amplify a 685-bp and an 876-bp fragment in the cultivars with high and low PPO activity, respectively. The difference of 191-bp size was detected in the intron region of the PPO gene. The STS marker PPO18 was mapped to chromosome 2AL using a DH population derived from a cross Zhongyou 9507 x CA9632, a set of nulli-tetrasomic lines and ditelosomic line 2AS of Chinese Spring. QTL analysis indicated that the PPO gene co-segregated with the STS marker PPO18 and is closely linked to Xgwm312 and Xgwm294 on chromosome 2AL, explaining 28-43% of phenotypic variance for PPO activity across three environments. A total of 233 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines were used to validate the correlation between the polymorphic fragments of PPO18 and grain PPO activity. The results showed that PPO18 is a co-dominant, efficient and reliable molecular marker for PPO activity and can be used in wheat breeding programs targeted for noodle quality improvement.

AB A modified, non-damaging, protocol for the production of fertile transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cultivar Giza 164) plants by laser micropuncture was developed. The new homemade setup secures the transformation of as many as 60 immature embryo-derived calli (10000 cells each) in less than one hour using a UV excimer laser with two dimensional translation stages, a suitable computer program and a proper optical system. Five-day-old calli were irradiated by a focused laser microbeam to puncture momentarily made self-healing holes (similar to 0.5 mu m) in the cell wall and membrane to allow uptake of the exogenous DNA. The plant expression vector pAB6 containing bar gene as a selectable marker for the herbicide bialaphos resistance and GUS (uidA) gene as a reporter gene was used for transformation. No selection pressure was conducted during the four-week callus induction period. Induced calli were transferred to a modified MS medium with 1 mg l(-1) bialaphos for regeneration, followed by selection on 2 mg l(-1) bialaphos for rooting. Three regenerated putative transgenic events were evaluated for the integration and stable expression of both genes and results indicated that this modified procedure of laser-mediated transformation can be successfully used in transforming wheat.

SO PLANT BREEDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Triticum aestivum; Puccinia triticina; Lr34; leaf tip necrosis
AB The gene Lr34 has contributed to durable resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina in wheat worldwide. The closely associated leaf tip necrosis is generally used as the gene's marker. Lr34 has been postulated in many Indian bread wheat cultivars including 'C 306', based on the associated leaf tip necrosis and a few other field and glasshouse observations. The present study showed monogenic control of adult-plant resistance in 'C 306' to leaf rust pathotype 77-5 (121R63-1). The F-2 segregation in the crosses between 'C 306' and the two known carriers of Lr34, 'Line 897' and 'Jupateco 73' 'R' fitted a digenic ratio. The F-3 families derived from the susceptible F-2 segregants were true breeding for susceptibility, proving the absence of Lr34 in 'C 306'. The cross between 'Line 897' and 'Jupateco 73' 'R' did not segregate for susceptibility. Resistance in the cross 'Agra Local' (susceptible) x 'C 306' was associated with leaf tip necrosis, showing that the leaf rust resistance gene in 'C 306' was associated with leaf tip necrosis, but was different from Lr34. This gene is being temporarily designated as Lr'C 306'. Hence, leaf tip necrosis cannot be considered as an exclusive marker for selecting Lr34 in wheat improvement.

TI The linkage between the stem rust resistance gene Sr2 and pseudo-black

SO PLANT BREEDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Triticum aestivum; Puccinia graminis tritici; pseudo-black chaff; Sr2
AB Recessively inherited gene Sr2 has provided the basis of durable resistance to stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The associated earhead and stem melanism or 'pseudo-black chaff' is generally used as a marker for this gene. Sr2 has been postulated in many wheat cultivars of India including 'Lok 1', based on associated pseudo-black chaff in adult plants, and leaf chlorosis in seedlings. However, dominant inheritance of the resistance factor operating in 'Lok 1', and a 13 : 3 (resistant : susceptible) F-2 segregation in the 'Sr2-line' ('Chinese Spring'(6) x 'Hope' 3B) x 'Lok 1' cross confirmed that Sr2 was absent in 'Lok 1'. Susceptible plants with a pseudo-black chaff phenotype were observed in F-2 populations of 'Agra Local' (susceptible) x 'Lok 1', and the 'Sr2-line' x 'Lok 1' crosses. Most of the F-3 families derived from the susceptible F-2 segregants with pseudo-black chaff phenotypes were true breeding for the expression of pseudo-black chaff with susceptibility to stem rust. Thus, linkage of pseudo-black chaff with Sr2 in wheat can be broken, and hence, caution may be exercised in using pseudo-black chaff as a marker for selecting Sr2 in breeding programmes.

AB At the Pm3 locus in hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum), 10 alleles conferring race-specific resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) are known. A cluster of genes encoding coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat proteins spans the Pm3 locus on wheat chromosome 1A, and one member of this gene family has recently been identified as the Pm3b resistance gene. Using molecular markers closely linked to Pm3b, we performed haplotype analysis of 10 lines carrying different Pm3 alleles. All these lines have a conserved genomic region delimited by markers cosegregating with Pm3b and including a structurally conserved Pm3b-like gene. A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy allowed the amplification of one Pm3b-like sequence from lines carrying Pm3a, Pm3d, and Pm3f alleles. These candidate genes for Pm3a, Pm3d, and Pm3f conferred AvrPm3a-, AvrPm3d-, and AvrPm3f-dependent resistance, respectively, to wheat powdery mildew in a single cell transient transformation assay. A high level of amino acid similarity (97.8%) was found between the PM3A, PM3B, PM3D, and PM3F proteins. The coiled-coil domain was 100% conserved, whereas, in the nucleotide binding site region, sequence exchange was detected, indicating intragenic recombination or gene conversion between alleles. All these results indicate that Pm3a, Pm3b, Pm3d, and Pm3f form a true allelic series. The low level of sequence divergence between the four characterized alleles as well as the finding of a conserved Pm3 haplotype are in agreement with the hypothesis of a recent evolution of Pm3-based resistance, suggesting that some or most of the diversity found at the Pm3 locus in modern wheat has evolved after wheat domestication.

AB Polyploidy has been found to be common in plants. Bread or common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 42) is a good example of allopolyploid made up of three diploid genomes A, B and D. In recent years, by the study of mimicking the origination of common wheat, it was found that changes of DNA sequence and gene expression occurred at the early stages of artificial allohexaploid between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii, which was probably favorable to genetic diploidization of new synthetic hexaploid wheat. Common wheat 99L2 is a new line stable in genetic, which was derived from the early self-pollinated generation of wide hybrids between common wheat and rye. In this study, it was found that at least two rye DNA segments had been introgressed into 99L2. This result suggested that a mechanism of alien DNA introgression may exist, which was different from the traditional mechanism of chromosome pairing and DNA recombination between wheat and alien species. Meanwhile, during the introgression process of alien rye DNA segments, the changes in DNA sequences of wheat itself occurred.

AB Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an important crop, widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is highly susceptible to several biotic and abiotic stresses to which wild species are resistant. As a first step towards the introgression of these resistance genes into cultivated peanut, a linkage map based on microsatellite markers was constructed, using an F-2 population obtained from a cross between two diploid wild species with AA genome (A. duranensis and A. stenosperma). A total of 271 new microsatellite markers were developed in the present study from SSR-enriched genomic libraries, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and by "data-mining" sequences available in GenBank. Of these, 66 were polymorphic for cultivated peanut. The 271 new markers plus another 162 published for peanut were screened against both progenitors and 204 of these (47.1%) were polymorphic, with 170 codominant and 34 dominant markers. The 80 codominant markers segregating 1:2:1 (P < 0.05) were initially used to establish the linkage groups. Distorted and dominant markers were subsequently included in the map. The resulting linkage map consists of 11 linkage groups covering 1,230.89 cM of total map distance, with an average distance of 7.24 cM between markers. This is the first microsatellite-based map published for Arachis, and the first map based on sequences that are all currently publicly available. Because most markers used were derived from ESTs and genomic libraries made using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, about one-third of the mapped markers are genic. Linkage group ordering is being validated in other mapping populations, with the aim of constructing a transferable reference map for Arachis.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) starch synthase II, which is also known as starch granule protein 1 (SGP-1), plays a major role in endosperm starch synthesis. The three SGP-1 proteins, SGP-A1, B1 and D1, are produced by three homoeologous SSII genes, wSSII-A, B, and D. Lines carrying null alleles for each SGP-1 protein have previously been identified. In this report, the mutations occurring in each wSSII gene were characterized, and PCR-based DNA markers capable of detecting the mutations were developed. In the null wSSII-A allele, a 289 bp deletion accompanied by 8 bp of filler DNA was present near the initiation codon. A 175 bp insertion occurred in exon 8 of the null wSSII-B allele. The insertion represented a recently discovered miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) named Hikkoshi that was first found in a wheat waxy gene. A 63 bp deletion was found at the region surrounding the junction of the fifth exon and intron of the null wSSII-D allele. Based on this information, we designed primer sets to enable us to conduct allele-specific amplifications for each locus. The applicability of these primer sets for breeding programs was demonstrated by reconstructing a line lacking all three SGP-1 proteins using marker-assisted selection. These markers will also be useful in breeding programs aimed at obtaining partial mutants missing one or two SGP-1 proteins.

AB Genetic analysis of vernalization and photoperiod responses was carried out using eight wheat cultivars, in order to investigate the relationship between their genotype and the earliness of heading in the southwestern part of Japan. Allelism test of the genes for the vernalization response showed that three wheat cultivars, 'Fukuwasekomugi', 'Zenkoujikomugi' and 'Schomburgk', harboured Vrn-D1, Vrn-D1 and Vrn-A1, respectively. Among the eight cultivars tested, 'Haruhikari' was sensitive to short photoperiod, while the others were insensitive. Segregation analysis of the photoperiod response in the F-2 and B1F1 populations showed that the very late heading cultivar 'Haruhikari' did not harbour major genes for insensitivity to photoperiod. Six cultivars characterized by medium to late heading, 'Norin 61', 'Zenkoujikomugi', 'Saitama 27', 'Schomburgk', 'Norin 59' and 'Norin 67', carried a single gene for insensitivity, Ppd-S, in common. The extremely early heading cultivar 'Fukuwasekomugi' was found to carry two genes for insensitivity, Ppd-S and Ppd-F, the latter displaying a stronger effect for insensitivity to photoperiod. The present study revealed that the earliness of heading in the southwestern part of Japan was closely related to the Ppd genotype of wheat cultivars, whereas it was independent of the Vrn genotype.

AB Hybridizations between hard and soft wheat types could be a source of novel variation for wheat quality improvement. This study was conducted to identify genomic regions related to differences in milling and baking quality between a soft and a hard cultivar of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A population of 101 double-haploid lines was generated from a cross between Grandin, a hard spring wheat variety, and AC Reed, a soft spring wheat variety. The genetic map included 320 markers in 43 linkage groups and spanned 3555 cM. Quadrumat-milled flour yield, softness equivalent, flour protein content and alkaline water retention capacity were evaluated for three locations and one year, and Allis-Chalmers milling, mixograph, and cookie baking tests were completed without replication. The effect of qualitative variation for kernel texture, caused by the segregation of the Hardness gene, was controlled by regression on texture class. The residual variance was used for composite interval mapping, and QTLs on 1A, 1B, 1A/D, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A/B, 4B, 5B and 6B were detected. The effect of some QTLs was opposite to the direction expected on the basis of parental phenotypes. The hard wheat parent contributed alleles favorable for soft wheat varieties at QTLs on 1AS,L, 1BL-2, and 6B, whereas the soft parent contributed alleles for higher protein content at QTLs on 2BL-1, 4B-1, and 6B and higher flour yield on 2BL-2 and 4B-2. These results indicated that hard X soft wheat crosses have considerable potential for improving milling and baking quality of either class.

AB The rate at which wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) reaches anthesis and other developmental stages depends largely on the variation of three major factors: vernalization (Vrn), photoperiod (Ppd), and earliness per se (Eps). The objectives of this study were to characterize a set of genotypes for the presence of developmental genes and their potential association to adaptability and to identify diagnostic molecular markers for the vernalization gene Vrn-D1. Fifty-one genotypes were crossed with testers containing known Vrn and Ppd genes. To determine earliness per se and its interaction with temperature, genotypes were vernalized for 8 wk and placed in a 24-h photoperiod regime at two temperatures. To validate molecular markers for Vrn-D1, the cultivars were genotyped with closely linked SSR markers Xgwm292-5D and Xgwm212-5D. Segregation analysis on F-2 populations of field-grown plants showed that Vrn-D1 was present in 66% of the cultivars, while Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn4 were found in 41, 39, and 8% of the lines, respectively, either solely or in combination with other Vrn genes. A low percentage of cultivars appeared to have a constitutive genetic character for early flowering (Eps), while most of the cultivars may have temperature-sensitive genes that respond to local environmental changes. Vrn-D1 was reliably detected in 76.5% of the genotypes using the 215-bp allele of microsatellite marker Xgwm292-5D, whereas Xgwm212-5D did not reveal sufficient allelic variation within the tested wheats.

AB Wheat microsatellite XGWM261, due to its closely linked to the dwarfing gene Rht8, has been adopted as the diagnostic molecular marker of Rht8. Screening 408 Chinese and 98 exotic varieties showed 13 allele variants in locus of XGWM261, with 6 alleles only to be found in Chinese varieties and 2 only in exotic varieties, respectively. Sequencing results of the 13 alleles revealed their absolute fragment sizes with 216, 212, 210, 206, 204, 202, 200, 196, 194, 192, 190, 174, and 164 bp, respectively. Allelic distribution analysis showed that the 204, 192, 174, and 164 bp alleles were prevailing in Chinese varieties, and the diagnostic 192 bp allele to Rht8 had a very high percentage in the Yellow and Huai River Valleys Facultative Wheat Zone than in the Northern Winter Wheat Zone in China. The GT --> AC substitution at position 35 was found in 216, 200, and 174 bp alleles. Moreover, the AG insertion immediately at the end of CT-repeat region was also found in 216, 200, 174, and 164 bp alleles.

AB Seed dormancy is one of the important factors controlling pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) resistance in wheat. We identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for seed dormancy on the long arm of wheat chromosome 4A (4AL) via simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based genetic mapping using doubled haploid lines from a cross between Japanese PHS resistant variety 'Kitamoe' and the Alpine non-resistant variety "Munstertaler" (K/M). The QTL explained 43.3% of total phenotypic variation for seed dormancy under greenhouse conditions. SSR markers flanking the QTL were assigned to the chromosome long arm fraction length 0.59-0.66 on the basis of chromosome deletion analysis, suggesting that the gene(s) controlling seed dormancy are probably located within this region. Under greenhouse conditions, the QTL explained 28.5 and 39.0% of total phenotypic variation for seed dormancy in Haruyutaka/Leader (HT/L) and OS21-5/Haruyokoi (O/HK) populations, respectively. However, in field conditions, the effect was relatively low or not significant in both the K/M and HT/L populations. These markers were considered to be widely useful in common with various genetic backgrounds for improvement of seed dormancy through the use of marker-assisted selection. Further detailed research using near isogenic lines will be needed to define how this major QTL interacts with environmental conditions in our area.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosome 3 is evolutionarily conserved across the cultivated cereals and shares large blocks of synteny with maize and sorghum, which diverged from rice more than 50 million years ago. To begin to completely understand this chromosome, we sequenced, finished, and annotated 36.1 Mb (similar to 97%) from O. sativa subsp. japonica cv Nipponbare. Annotation features of the chromosome include 5915 genes, of which 913 are related to transposable elements. A putative function could be assigned to 3064 genes, with another 757 genes annotated as expressed, leaving 2094 that encode hypothetical proteins. Similarity searches against the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed putative homologs for 67% of the chromosome 3 proteins. Further searches of a nonredundant amino acid database, the Pfam domain database, plant Expressed Sequence Tags, and genomic assemblies from sorghum and maize revealed only 853 nontransposable element related proteins from chromosome 3 that lacked similarity to other known sequences. Interestingly, 426 of these have a paralog within the rice genome. A comparative physical map of the wild progenitor species, Oryza nivara, with japonica chromosome 3 revealed a high degree of sequence identity and synteny between these two species, which diverged similar to 10,000 years ago. Although no major rearrangements were detected, the deduced size of the O. nivara chromosome 3 was 21% smaller than that of japonica. Synteny between rice and other cereals using an integrated maize physical map and wheat genetic map was strikingly high, further Supporting the use of rice and, in particular, chromosome 3, as a model for comparative studies among the cereals.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) is transmitted by a fungal vector through soil and causes serious wheat yield losses due to yellow mosaic disease, with yellow-streaked leaves and stunted plants. In the present study, the amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) were used to identify the molecular linkages with the resistance gene against WYMV. Bulked segregant analysis was performed with an F-2 population derived from the cross of cultivar Ningmai 9 (resistant) X cultivar Yangmai 10 (susceptible). By screening among the resistant or susceptible parents, the F2 pools and the individuals in the F2 population with 64 combined selective AFLP primers (EcoRI/Msel) or 290 reported SSR primers, a polymorphic DNA segment (approximately 120 bp) was amplified using the primer pair E2/M5, and an SSR marker (approximately 180 bp) was located on wheat chromosome 2A using the primer Xgwm328. Analysis with MAPMAKER/Exp Version 3.0b (Whitehead institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA) indicated that these two markers were dominantly associated with the resistance gene at distances of 5.4 cM or 17.6 cM, respectively. The resistance gene to WYMV derived from Ningmai 9, is temporarily named YmNM, and was mapped to wheat chromosome 2A.

AB Atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides in the USA. Atrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA), the first enzyme in a six-step pathway leading to the mineralization of atrazine in Gram-negative soil bacteria, catalyses the hydrolytic dechlorination and detoxification of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine. In this study, we investigated the potential use of transgenic plants expressing atzA to take up, dechlorinate and detoxify atrazine. Alfalfa, Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco were transformed with a modified bacterial atzA gene, p-atzA, under the control of the cassava vein mosaic virus promoter. All transgenic plant species actively expressed p-atzA and grew over a wide range of atrazine concentrations. Thin layer chromatography analyses indicated that in planta expression of p-atzA resulted in the production of hydroxyatrazine. Hydroponically grown transgenic tobacco and alfalfa dechlorinated atrazine to hydroxyatrazine in leaves, stems and roots. Moreover, p-atzA was found to be useful as a conditional-positive selection system to isolate alfalfa and Arabidopsis transformants following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Our work suggests that the in planta expression of p-atzA may be useful for the development of plants for the phytoremediation of atrazine-contaminated soils and soil water, and as a marker gene to select for the integration of exogenous DNA into the plant genome.

AB Molecular mapping of genes for crop resistance to the greenbug, Schizaphis graminum Rondani, will facilitate selection of greenbug resistance in breeding through marker-assisted selection and provide information for map-based gene cloning. In the present study, microsatellite marker and deletion line analyses were used to map greenbug resistance genes in five newly identified wheat germplasms derived from Aegilops tauschii. Our results indicate that the Gb genes in these germplasms are inherited as single dominant traits. Microsatellite markers Xwmc157 and Xgdm150 flank Gbx1 at 2.7 and 3.3 cM, respectively. Xwmc671 is proximately linked to Gba, Gbb, Gbc and Gbd at 34.3, 5.4, 13.7, 7.9 cM, respectively. Xbarc53 is linked distally to Gba and Gbb at 20.7 and 20.2 cM, respectively. Xgdm50 is distal to Gbc at 17.9 cM, and Xwmc157 is distal to Gbd at 1.9 cM. Gbx1, Gba, Gbb, Gbc, Gbd and the previously characterized Gbz are located in the distal 18% region of wheat chromosome 7DL. Gbd appears to be a new greenbug resistance gene different from Gbx1 or Gbz. Gbx1, Gbz Gba, Gbb, Gbc and Gbd are either allelic or linked to Gb3.

AB Stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks and Henn and leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Rob. ex Desm. are major constraints to wheat production worldwide. In the present study, F-4-derived SSD population, developed from a cross between Australian cultivars 'Schomburgk' and 'Yarralinka', was used to identify molecular markers linked to rust resistance genes Lr3a and Sr22. A total of 1,330 RAPD and 100 ISSR primers and 33 SSR primer pairs selected on the basis of chromosomal locations of these genes were used. The ISSR marker UBC 840(540) was found to be linked with Lr3a in repulsion at a distance of 6.0 cM. Markers cfa2019 and cfa2123 flanked Sr22 at a distance of 5.9 cM (distal) and 6.0 cM (proximal), respectively. The use of these markers in combination would predict the presence or absence of Sr22 in breeding populations. A previously identified PCR-based diagnostic marker STS638 linked to Lr20 was validated in this population. This marker showed a recombination value of 7.1 cM with Lr20.

AB Homology-based gene/gene-analog cloning method has been extensively applied in isolation of RGAs (resistance gene analogs) in various plant species. However, serious interference of sequences on homoeologous chromosomes in polyploidy species usually occurred when cloning RGAs in a specific chromosome. In this research, the techniques of chromosome microdissection combined with homology-based cloning were used to clone RGAs from a specific chromosome of Wheat-Thinopyrum alien addition line TAi-27, which was derived from common wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium with a pair of chromosomes from Th. intermedium. The alien chromosomes carry genes for resistance to BYDV. The alien chromosome in TAi-27 was isolated by a glass needle and digested with proteinase K. The DNA of the alien chromosome was amplified by two rounds of Sau3A linker adaptor-mediated PCR. RGAs were amplified by PCR with the degenerated primers designed based on conserved domains of published resistance genes (R genes) by using the alien chromosome DNA, genomic DNA and cDNA of Th. intermedium, TAi-27 and 3B-2 (a parent of TAi-27) as templates. A total of seven RGAs were obtained and sequenced. Of which, a constitutively expressed single-copy NBS-LRR type RGA ACR3 was amplified from the dissected alien chromosome of TAi-27, TcDR2 and TcDR3 were from cDNA of Th. intermedium, AcDR3 was from cDNA of TAi-27, FcDR2 was from cDNA of 3B-2, AR2 was from genomic DNA of TAi-27 and TR2 was from genomic DNA of Th. intermedium. Sequence homology analyses showed that the above RGAs were highly homologous with known resistance genes or resistance gene analogs and belonged to NBS-LRR type of R genes. ACR3 was recovered by PCR from genomic DNA and cDNA of Th. intermedium and TAi-27, but not from 3B-2. Southern hybridization using the digested genomic DNA of Th. intermedium, TAi-27 and 3B-2 as the template and ACR3 as the probe showed that there is only one copy of ACR3 in the genome of Th. intermedium and TAi-27, but it is absent in 3B-2. The ACR3 could be used as a specific probe of the R gene on the alien chromosome of TAi-27. Results of Northern hybridization suggested that ACR3 was constitutively expressed in Th. intermedium and TAi-27, but not 3B-2, and expressed higher in leaves than in roots. This research demonstrated a new way to clone RGAs located on a specific chromosome. The information reported here should be useful to understand the resistance mechanism of, and to clone resistant genes from, the alien chromosome in TAi-27.

AB Switchgrass is a large, North American, perennial grass that is being evaluated as a potential energy crop. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from four switchgrass cv. "Kanlow" cDNA libraries to create a gene inventory of 7,810 unique gene clusters from a total of 11,990 individual sequences. Blast similarity searches to SwissProt and GenBank non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases were performed and a total of 79% of these unique clusters were found to be similar to existing protein or nucleotide sequences. Tentative functional classification of 61% of the sequences was possible by association with appropriate gene ontology descriptors. Significant differential representation between genes in leaf, stem, crown, and callus libraries was observed for many highly expressed genes The unique gene clusters were screened for the presence of short tandem repeats for further development as microsatellite markers. A total of 334 gene clusters contained repeats representing 3.8% of the ESTs queried.

AB Assimilation of carbon by plants incurs water costs. In the many parts of the world where water is in short supply, plant transpiration efficiency, the ratio of carbon fixation to water loss, is critical to plant survival, crop yield and vegetation dynamics(1). When challenged by variations in their environment, plants often seem to coordinate photosynthesis and transpiration(2), but significant genetic variation in transpiration efficiency has been identified both between and within species(3,4). This has allowed plant breeders to develop effective selection programmes for the improved transpiration efficiency of crops(5), after it was demonstrated that carbon isotopic discrimination, Delta, of plant matter was a reliable and sensitive marker negatively related to variation in transpiration efficiency(3,4,6). However, little is known of the genetic controls of transpiration efficiency. Here we report the isolation of a gene that regulates transpiration efficiency, ERECTA. We show that ERECTA, a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK)(7,8) known for its effects on inflorescence development(7,9), is a major contributor to a locus for Delta on Arabidopsis chromosome 2. Mechanisms include, but are not limited to, effects on stomatal density, epidermal cell expansion, mesophyll cell proliferation and cell - cell contact.

AB Full-length coding sequences of the beta-tubulin gene (tubA) were PCR-amplified and sequenced from 42 Phaeosphaeria isolates, including, 16 P. nodorum and 23 P. avenaria species from cereals, two Polish isolates from rye (Secale cereale L.), and one isolate from dallis grass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir). A tubA gene of size 1556 bp was identified in wheat- and barley-biotype P. nodorum (PN-w and PN-b), P. avenaria f. sp. avenaria (Paa), homothallic P. avenaria f. sp. triticea (P.a.t.) (Pat1) and the P.a.t. isolate (Pat3) from the State of Washington. The tubA gene length polymorphisms were detected in two P.a.t. isolates (Pat2) from foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.), one from dallis grass and two Polish isolates from rye. These size differences were due to the variation of intron lengths among these three Phaeosphaeria species. All Phaeosphaeria isolates have identical 1344 bp exons that can be translated into a 447 amino acid P-tubulin. Like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the P-tubulin amino acid sequence was identical in all Phaeosphaeria species used in this study, with the exception of the two Pat2 isolates. Six amino acid differences were evident in the P-tubulin of these Pat2 isolates. (c) 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two dominant powdery mildew resistance genes introduced from Triticum carthlicum accession PS5 to common wheat were identified and tagged using microsatellite markers. The gene designated PmPS5A was placed on wheat chromosome 2AL and linked to the microsatellite marker Xgwm356 at a genetic distance of 10.2 cM. Based on the information of its origin, chromosome location, and reactions to 5 powdery mildew isolates, this gene could be a member of the complex Pm4 locus. The 2nd gene designated PmPS5B was located on wheat chromosome 2BL with 3 microsatellite markers mapping proximally to the gene: Xwmc317 at 1.1 cM; Xgwm111 at 2.2 cM; and Xgwm382 at 4.0 cM; and 1 marker, Xgwm526, mapping distally to the gene at a distance of 18.1 cM. Since this gene showed no linkage to the other 2 known powdery mildew resistance genes on wheat chromosome 2B, Pm6 and Pm26, we believe it is a novel powdery mildew resistance gene and propose to designate this gene as Pm33.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) deletion (del) stocks are valuable tools for the physical mapping of molecular markers and genes to chromosome bins delineated by 2 adjacent deletion breakpoints. The wheat deletion stocks were produced by using gametocidal genes derived from related Aegilops species. Here, we report on the origin, structure, and behavior of a highly rearranged chromosome 1BS-4. The cytogenetic and molecular marker analyses suggest that 1BS-4 resulted from 2 breakpoints in the 1BS arm and 1 breakpoint in the 1BL arm. The distal segment from 1BS, except for a small deleted part, is translocated to the long arm. Cytologically, chromosome 1BS-4 is highly stable, but shows a unique meiotic pairing behavior. The short arm of 1BS-4 fails to pair with a normal 1BS arm because of lack of homology at the distal ends. The long arm of 1BS-4 only pairs with a normal 1BS arm within the distal region translocated from 1BS. Therefore, using the 1BS-4 deletion stock for physical mapping will result in the false allocation of molecular markers and genes proximal to the breakpoint of 1BS-4.

AB Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus disease caused by different strains of BaYMV and BaMMV is a major threat to winter barley cultivation in Europe. Pyramiding of resistance genes may be considered as a promising strategy to avoid the selection of new virus strains and to create more durable resistances. However, this goal cannot be achieved by phenotypic selection due to the lack of differentiating virus strains. For pyramiding of resistance genes rym4, rym5, rym9 and rym11, located on chromosomes 3H and 4H of barley two different strategies have been developed. These strategies are based on doubled haploid lines (DHs) and marker assisted selection procedures. On the one hand F-1 derived DH-plants of single crosses were screened by molecular markers for genotypes being homozygous recessive for both resistance genes. These genotypes were crossed to lines carrying one resistance gene in common and an additional third gene, leading to a DH-population of which 25% carry three resistance genes, 50% have two resistance genes and 25% possess a single resistance gene homozygous recessively. Alternatively, F-1 plants having one resistance gene in common were directly inter-crossed [e.g. (rym4 x rym9) x (rym4 x rym11)] and about 100 seeds were produced per combination. Within these complex cross progenies plants were identified by markers being homozygous at the common resistance locus and heterozygous at the others. From such plants, theoretically present at a frequency of 6.25%, DH-lines were produced, which were screened for the presence of genotypes carrying three or two recessive resistance genes in a homozygous state. Besides DH-plants carrying all possible two-gene combinations, 20 DH-plants out of 107 analysed carrying rym4, rym9, and rym11 and 27 out of 187 tested carrying rym5, rym9, and rym11 homozygously have been detected using the second strategy which is faster but needs co-dominant markers, because in contrast to the first strategy marker selection is carried out on heterozygous genotypes.

AB The advent of molecular markers as a tool to aid selection has provided plant breeders with the opportunity to rapidly deliver superior genetic solutions to problems in agricultural production systems. However, a major constraint to the implementation of marker-assisted selection (MAS) in pragmatic breeding programs in the past has been the perceived high relative cost of MAS compared to conventional phenotypic selection. In this paper, computer simulation was used to design a genetically effective and economically efficient marker-assisted breeding strategy aimed at a specific outcome. Under investigation was a strategy involving the integration of both restricted backcrossing and doubled haploid (DH) technology. The point at which molecular markers are applied in a selection strategy can be critical to the effectiveness and cost efficiency of that strategy. The application of molecular markers was considered at three phases in the strategy: allele enrichment in the BC1F1 population, gene selection at the haploid stage and the selection for recurrent parent background of DHs prior to field testing. Overall, incorporating MAS at all three stages was the most effective, in terms of delivering a high frequency of desired outcomes and at combining the selected favourable rust resistance, end use quality and grain yield alleles. However, when costs were included in the model the combination of MAS at the BC1F1 and haploid stage was identified as the optimal strategy. A detailed economic analysis showed that incorporation of marker selection at these two stages not only increased genetic gain over the phenotypic alternative but actually reduced the over all cost by 40%.

AB Most barley cultivars are resistant to stripe rust of wheat that is caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. The barley cv. Steptoe is susceptible to all identified races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (PSH), the barley stripe rust pathogen, but is resistant to most P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races. To determine inheritance of the Steptoe resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, a cross was made between Steptoe and Russell, a barley cultivar susceptible to some P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races and all tested P. striiformis f. sp. hordei races. Seedlings of parents and F-1, BC1, F-2, and F-3 progeny from the barley cross were tested with P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races PST-41 and PST-45 under controlled greenhouse conditions. Genetic analyses of infection type data showed that Steptoe had one dominant gene and one recessive gene (provisionally designated as RpstS1 and rpstS2, respectively) for resistance to races PST-41 and PST-45. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents and 150 F-2 plants that were tested for rust reaction and grown for seed of F-3 lines. The infection type data and polymorphic markers identified using the resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique were analyzed with the Map-maker computer program to map the resistance genes. The dominant resistance gene in Steptoe for resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races was mapped on barley chromosome 4H using a linked microsatellite marker, HVM68. A linkage group for the dominant gene was constructed with 12 RGAP markers and the microsatellite marker. The results show that resistance in barley to the wheat stripe rust pathogen is qualitatively inherited. These genes might provide useful resistance against wheat stripe rust when introgressed into wheat from barley.

AB 'Yi 4060' is an elite restorer line of a non-photoperiod-sensitive D-2-type cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) line of wheat. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were employed to map one major fertility-restoring gene (D(2)Rf(1)) in 'Yi 4060'. The sterile and fertile DNA pools were established from individuals in BC6, based on bulked segregant analysis. One RAPD marker E09, linked to D(2)Rf(1), was converted to a SCAR marker and designated as E09-SCAR(865). The genetic distance between E09-SCAR(865) and D(2)Rf(1) is 9.5 cM. Two SSR markers, Xgwm11 and Xgwm18, were also linked to a D(2)Rf(1) and co-segregated with E09-SCAR(865). The three molecular markers are useful in marker-assisted breeding of the elite restorer lines for D-2-type CMS lines in wheat.

AB Doubled haploid lines (n=160) from a cross between wheat cultivars 'Cranbrook' (high dough extensibility) and 'Halberd' (low dough extensibility) were grown at three Australian locations. The parents differ at all high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin loci. Dough rheological parameters were measured using small-scale testing procedures, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping procedures were carried out using an existing well-saturated genetic linkage map for this cross. Genetic parameters were estimated using three software packages: QTLCartographer, Epistat and Genstat. Results indicated that environmental factors are a major determinant of dough extensibility across the three trial sites, whereas genotypic factors are the major determinants of dough strength. Composite interval mapping analysis across the 21 linkage groups revealed that as expected, the main additive QTLs for dough rheological properties are located at the high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin loci. A new QTL on chromosome 5A for M-extensibility (a mixograph-estimated measure of extensibility) was detected. Analysis of epistatic interactions revealed that there were significant conditional epistatic interactions related with the additive effects of glutenin loci on dough rheological properties. Therefore, the additive genetic effects of glutenins on dough rheological properties are conditional upon the genetic background of the wheat line. The molecular basis of the interactions with the glutenin loci may be via proteins that modify or alter the gluten protein matrix or variations in the expression level of the glutenin genes. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the molar number of individual glutenin subunits across the population showed that certain conditional epistases resulted in increased expression of the affected glutenin. The epistatic interactions detected in this study provide a possible explanation of the variable genetic effects of some glutenins on quality attributes in different genetic backgrounds and provide essential information for the accurate prediction of glutenin related variance in marker-assisted wheat breeding.

AB Opportunities exist for replacing reduced height (Rht) genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b with alternative dwarfing genes for bread wheat improvement. In this study, the chromosomal locations of several height-reducing genes were determined by screening populations of recombinant inbred lines or doubled haploid lines varying for plant height with microsatellite markers. Linked markers were found for Rht5 (on chromosome 3BS), Rht12 (5AL) and Rht13 (7BS), which accounted for most of the phenotypic variance in height in the respective populations. Large height differences between genotypes (up to 43 cm) indicated linkage to major height-reducing genes. Rht4 was associated with molecular markers on chromosome 2BL, accounting for up to 30% of the variance in height. Confirming previous studies, Rht8 was linked to markers on chromosome 2DS, whereas a population varying for Rht9 revealed a region with a small but significant height effect on chromosome 5AL. The height-reducing effect of these dwarfing genes was repeatable across a range of environments. The molecular markers developed in this study will be useful for marker-assisted selection of alternative height-reducing genes, and to better understand the effects of different Rht genes on wheat growth and agronomic performance.

AB The use of major resistance genes is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing stem rust epidemics in Australian wheat crops. The long-term success of this strategy is dependent on combining resistance genes that are effective against all predominant races of the pathogen, a task greatly assisted by the use of molecular markers linked to individual resistance genes. The wheat stem rust resistance genes Sr24 and Sr26 (derived from Agropyron elongatum) and SrR and Sr31 (derived from rye) are available in wheat as segments of alien chromosome translocated to wheat chromosomes. Each of these genes provides resistance to all races of wheat stem rust currently found in Australia .We have developed robust PCR markers for Sr24 and Sr26 (this study) and SrR and Sr31 (previously reported) that are applicable across a wide selection of Australian wheat germplasm. Wheat lines have recently become available in which the size of the alien segments containing Sr26, SrR and Sr31 has been reduced. Newly developed PCR-markers can be used to identify the presence of the shorter alien segment in all cases. Assuming that these genes have different gene-for-gene specificities and that the wheat industry will discourage the use of varieties carrying single genes only, the newly developed PCR markers will facilitate the incorporation of two or more of the genes Sr24, Sr26, SrR and Sr31 into wheat lines and have the potential to provide durable control to stem rust in Australia and elsewhere.

AB Using a set of 21 substitution lines of Triticum macha in a 'Hobbit Sib' background, it was previously demonstrated that chromosome 4A of T. macha carries significant resistance to Fusarium head blight. In the present study, the T. macha 4A resistance was further characterized in a 'Hobbit Sib' (T. macha 4A) single-recombinant chromosome doubled haploid (DH) population. Lines were phenotyped for disease resistance, yield components and deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin content over two consecutive seasons. Both resistance to spread and resistance to initial infection were examined, and it was established that the resistance residing on T. macha 4A is predominantly of type I (resistance to initial infection). It was demonstrated that this type I resistance significantly lowered levels of DON accumulation in the grain and improved yield components under high disease pressure. Genotyping the DH lines using microsatellite genetic markers enabled the location of the gene(s) for resistance to be assigned to a region of the short arm of chromosome 4A, distal to microsatellite marker Xgwm601 and co-segregating with microsatellite marker Xgwm165 in this population.

AB Aegilops cylindrica Host (2n=4x=28, genome CCDD) is an allotetraploid formed by hybridization between the diploid species Ae. tauschii Coss. (2n=2x=14, genome DD) and Ae. markgrafii (Greuter) Hammer (2n=2x=14, genome CC). Previous research has shown that Ae. tauschii contributed its cytoplasm to Ae. cylindrica. However, our analysis with chloroplast microsatellite markers showed that 1 of the 36 Ae. cylindrica accessions studied, TK 116 (PI 486249), had a plastome derived from Ae. markgrafii rather than Ae. tauschii. Thus, Ae. markgrafii has also contributed its cytoplasm to Ae. cylindrica. Our analysis of chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers also suggests that D-type plastome and the D genome in Ae. cylindrica were closely related to, and were probably derived from, the tauschii gene pool of Ae. tauschii. A determination of the likely source of the C genome and the C-type plastome in Ae. cylindrica was not possible.

AB Wheat yellow mosaic disease, which is caused by wheat yellow mosaic bymovirus (WYMV) and transmitted by soil-borne fungus, results in severe damage on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in China. For development of resistant cultivars to reduce wheat yield losses due to wheat yellow mosaic disease, resistance test and genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene in wheat cultivar Yangfu 9311 contributed to the resistance. Bulk segregant analysis was used to identify microsatellite markers linked to the resistance gene in an F-2 population derived from the cross Yangfu 9311 (resistant) x Yangmai 10 (susceptible). Microsatellite markers Xwmc41, Xwmc181, Xpsp3039, and Xgwm349 were co-dominantly or dominantly linked with the gene responsible for WYMV resistance at a distance of 8.1-11.6 cM. Based on the wheat microsatellite consensus map and the results from amplification of the cultivar Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic stocks, the resistance gene to wheat yellow mosaic disease derived from Yangfu 9311, temporarily named as YmYF, was thus mapped on the long arm of chromosome 2D (2DL).

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum, can significantly reduce the grain quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) due to mycotoxin contamination. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for FHB resistance in a winter wheat population developed by crossing the resistant German cultivar Dream with the susceptible British cultivar Lynx. A total of 145 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were evaluated following spray inoculation with a F. culmorum suspension in field trials in 2002 in four environments across Germany. Based on amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat marker data, a 1,734 cM linkage map was established assuming that the majority of the polymorphic parts of the genome were covered. The area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated based on the visually scored FHB symptoms. The population segregated quantitatively for FHB severity. Composite interval mapping analysis for means across the environments identified four FHB resistance QTLs on chromosomes 6AL, 1B, 2BL and 7BS. Individually the QTLs explained 19%, 12%, 11% and 21% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, and together accounted for 41%. The QTL alleles conferring resistance on 6AL, 2BL and 7BS originated from cv. Dream. The resistance QTL on chromosome 6AL partly overlapped with a QTL for plant height. The FHB resistance QTL on 7BS coincided with a QTL for heading date, but the additive effect on heading date was of minor importance. The resistance QTL on chromosome 1B was associated with the T1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation of Lynx.

AB Efficient user-friendly methods for mapping plant genomes are highly desirable for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), genotypic profiling, genomic studies, and marker-assisted selection. SSR (microsatellite) markers are user-friendly and efficient in detecting polymorphism, but they detect few loci. Target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) is a relatively new PCR-based technique that detects a large number of loci from a single reaction without extensive pre-PCR processing of samples. In the investigation reported here, we used both SSRs and TRAPs to generate over 700 markers for the construction of a genetic linkage map in a hard red spring wheat intervarietal recombinant inbred population. A framework map consisting of 352 markers accounted for 3,045 cM with an average density of one marker per 8.7 cM. On average, SSRs detected 1.9 polymorphic loci per reaction, while TRAPs detected 24. Both marker systems were suitable for assigning linkage groups to chromosomes using wheat aneuploid stocks. We demonstrated the utility of the maps by identifying major QTLs for days to heading and reduced plant height on chromosomes 5A and 4B, respectively. Our results indicate that TRAPs are highly efficient for genetic mapping in wheat. The maps developed will be useful for the identification of quality and disease resistance QTLs that segregate in this population.

AB Purpose: An unusual retinal vascular morphology in an enucleated eye from a patient with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) has been associated with a mutation in AIPL1. The AIPL1 protein is expressed in the pineal gland and retinal photoreceptors. In the retina, AIPL1 is expressed in both developing cone and rod photoreceptors, but it is restricted to rod photoreceptors in the adult human retina. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the photoreceptor phenotype in this LCA patient to determine if photoreceptors were differentially affected.
   Methods: Additional genetic screening was performed and the consequences of the H82Y amino acid substitution characterized in an in vitro assay of NUB1 modulation. The morphology of the photoreceptors was examined by light and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent confocal microscopy was performed using a range of retinal photoreceptor markers.
   Results: Transfection of the H82Y mutant AIPL1 in SK-N-SH cells revealed a normal subcellular localization and solubility but resulted in an increased ability of AIPL1 to redistribute GFP-NUB1 to the cytoplasm and resolve NUB1 fragment inclusion formation. Morphologically, the LCA retina appeared to be cone-dominant with a single layer of cone-like cells remaining in the central retina. Photoreceptor outer segments were absent and the surviving residual inner segments were severely shortened. Severe degeneration of the LCA retina was associated with upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). No signal was detected for AIPL1, rhodopsin, or L/M and S cone opsins in the LCA retina. Double labeling with peanut agglutinin (PNA) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) supported a cone-dominant phenotype for the surviving photoreceptors in the LCA retina, as did double labeling for cone arrestin, and rod and cone recoverin. The cone arrestin signal was restricted to the residual photoreceptor inner segments and was not detected in the cell bodies, axons, or axon terminals of the surviving photoreceptors. Recoverin immunoreactivity was most intense in the residual photoreceptor inner segments.
   Conclusions: The phenotype in this patient suggests that although AIPL1 is required for the development of normal rod and cone photoreceptor function, it might only be essential for rod and not cone survival in the adult.

AB A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed from DNA of a commercially grown winter wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Norstar) that is highly tolerant to low temperatures (LT50 = -24 degrees C). The library was produced from nuclear leaf DNA that was partially digested with HindIII and inserted into pCC1BAC vector. In excess of 1.2 x 10(6) clones propagated in E. coli were obtained, archived in 384-well microtitre plates and stored at -80 degrees C. More than 97.1% of the recombinant plasmids contained inserts and were free from organelle DNA contamination. Analysis of 119 randomly isolated clones revealed insert sizes ranging from 17 to 262 kb with 26% of the inserts exceeding 100 kb. The average insert size was 75 kb and the genome coverage of the library was theoretically 5.5 times the haploid genome equivalent. This corresponds to a 99.6% probability of recovering any specific Norstar DNA sequence from the library. Screening of the library with nine simple sequence repeat (SSR) locus-specific markers supported a > 4.4-fold genome coverage. The BAC library was gridded onto high-density filters and will be used for isolation of genetic loci associated with cold-tolerance and grain quality traits.

AB Powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by Blumeria graminis DC sp. tritici Em. Marchal, occurs annually in eastern North America resulting in reduced grain yield and end-use quality in susceptible cultivars. The objectives of this study were to determine the inheritance, chromosomal location, and linkage with molecular markers of powdery mildew resistance genes in the two recently released germplasm lines NC96BGTA4 and NC99BGTAG11. Between 99 and 194 F-2:3 progenies plus parents in two populations, `Saluda' x NC96BGTA4 and Saluda x NC99BGTAG11, were evaluated in greenhouse and field nurseries for reaction to powdery mildew infection. Results indicated that the germplasm lines each contained a different, partially dominant, major resistance gene. The two segregating populations were subjected to amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat, or microsatellite (SSR) analyses. Both resistance genes were located on the long arm of chromosome 7A. The most likely locus order indicated that the resistance gene in NC96BGTA4 was flanked by the SSR loci Xbarc292 and Xwmc525. The resistance gene in NC99BGTAG11 was most likely flanked by the AFLP markers XE38M54-196 and XE36M55-126, and the SSR loci Xgwm332 and Xwmc525. Both genes mapped to a chromosome arm that contains the powdery mildew resistance loci Pm1 and Pm9. The resistance genes in the two germplasms are different from the Pm1a allele. Our mapping results suggested that the resistance genes were not alleles at the Pm1 or Pm9 loci, but further allelism tests are necessary to determine the relationships both between the two genes themselves and between the two genes and named Pm loci on chromosome 7AL.

AB Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae Wood-Mason) is the most destructive pest of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in several regions of South and Southeast Asia. Resistance to gall midge is primarily governed by single dominant genes in rice, thus newly evolving biotypes are able to overcome resistance genes rendering these genes ineffective. The objective of this study was to identify the gall midge resistance genes present in BG 380-2 and `Gurmatia' and their relationship to known resistance genes. F-1, F-2, and F-3 populations developed from crosses of BG 380-2 and Gurmatia with susceptible cultivars and differentials, possessing the known resistance genes, were screened for their reactions against gall midge biotype 1. Inheritance studies identified a single dominant gene for gall midge resistance in both BG 380-2 and Gurmatia. Allelic study revealed the gall midge resistance gene present in BG 380-2 was nonallelic to all currently known genes (Gm1, Gm2, gm3, Gm4, Gm5, Gm7, Gm8, and Gm9) that impart resistance against gall midge biotype 1 population and is designated as Gm10. The gall midge resistance gene present in Gurmatia was allelic to the Gm1 gene previously identified. This new resistance gene, Gm10, in BG 380-2 will be useful in breeding new varieties and for pyramiding multiple genes for durable resistance to rice gall midge.

AB Glaucous leaf and tough rachis phenotypes are rare in Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor to common wheat ( Triticum aestivum). The genes for glaucous leaf and tough rachis were mapped using microsatellite probes in A. tauschii. The glaucous phenotype was suppressed by the inhibitor W2(I) located on chromosome 2DS. The gene W2(I) was mapped to the distal part of 2DS, and was unlinked to the centromere. This suggests that the distance of the W2(I) locus from the centromere was maintained during the evolution of hexaploid wheat from its diploid progenitors as the inhibitor gene is at the same position in A. tauschii and bread wheat. The Br-t ( Brittle rachis of A. tauschii) locus was located on the short arm of chromosome 3D, and was 19.7 cM from the centromeric marker, Xgdm72.3D. Br-t causes breakage of the spike at the nodes, thus creating barrel-shaped spikelets, while Br-1 in hexaploid wheat causes breakage above the junction of the rachilla with the rachis such that a fragment of rachis is attached below each spikelet.

AB Genetic variation of forest coffee trees (Coffea arabica L.) from four regions of Ethiopia was investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. A total of 160 individuals representing 16 populations were sampled. Eleven ISSR primers amplified a total of 123 fragments of which 31 fragments (25%) were polymorphic. Estimate of total gene diversity (H-T), and the coefficient of genetic differentiation (G(ST)) were 0.37 and 0.81, respectively. This indicates that most of the variability is between populations than within populations. The partitioning of genetic variation into within and between populations based on Shannon's information index also revealed more differentiation between populations (0.80) than within populations (0.20). In the phenogram most of the coffee tree samples were clustered on the basis of their regions of origin but failed to cluster according to their respective populations, which could be attributed to the presence of substantial gene flow between adjacent populations in each region assisted by man in the process of transplantation or by wild animals such as monkeys, which eat the berries and defecate the seeds elsewhere. On the other hand, the inter-regional clustering of some coffee tree samples from Bale and Jimma regions could be due to the transport of coffee seeds across regions and their subsequent planting. Although ISSR markers detected lower polymorphic loci than previously reported results with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers on the same materials, it can be used as an alternative method for molecular characterization of C. arabica populations. The results may provide information to select sites for in situ conservation.

AB Both wheat and barley belong to tribe Triticeae and are closely related. High-density detailed comparison of physical and genetic linkage maps revealed that wheat genes are present in physically small gene-rich regions (GRRs). One of the largest GRRs is located around fraction length 1.0 of the long arm of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes termed the "2L1.0 region." The main objective of this study was to analyze the structural and functional organization of the 2L1.0 region in barley in comparison to wheat. Using the 29 physically mapped RFLP markers for the region, wheat and barley consensus genetic linkage maps of the 2L1.0 region were generated by combining information from 18 wheat and 7 barley genetic linkage maps. Comparative analysis using these consensus maps and other available wheat and barley mapping resources identified 227 DNA markers and ESTs for the region. The region accounted for 58% of the genes and 68% of the arm's recombination in wheat. However, the corresponding region in barley accounted for about 42% of the genes and 81% of the recombination. The kb/cM ratio for the region was 122 in barley compared to 244 in wheat. Distribution of genes and recombination varied between the two species even though the gene order and density were similar.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a highly Al-resistant species among small grain crops, but the mechanism responsible for the high Al resistance has not been elucidated. In this study, rice mutants sensitive to Al were isolated from M-3 lines derived from an Al-resistant cultivar, Koshihikari, irradiated with gamma-rays. Relative root elongation was used as a parameter for evaluating Al resistance. After initial screening plus two rounds of confirmatory testing, a mutant (als1) was isolated from a total of 560 lines. This mutant showed a phenotype similar to the wild-type plant in the absence of Al. However, in the presence of 10 mu M Al, root elongation was inhibited 70% in the mutant, but only 8% in the wild-type plant. The mutant also showed poorer root growth in acid soil. The Al content of root apices (0-1 cm) was much lower in the wild-type plant. The sensitivity to other metals including Cd and La did not differ between the mutant and the wild-type plants. A small amount of citrate was secreted from the roots of the mutant in response to Al stress, but there was no difference from that secreted by the wild-type plant. Genetic analysis of F-2 populations between als1 and wild-type plants showed that the Al-resistant seedlings and Al-sensitive seedlings segregated at a 3 : 1 ratio, indicating that the high sensitivity to Al in als1 is controlled by a single recessive gene. The gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6, flanked by InDel markers MaOs0619 and MaOs0615.

AB The GUS gene of E. coli, encoding beta-glucuronidase, has been widely used as a reporter gene in plant transformation. However, beta-glucuronidase activity in transgenic wheat leaf or root tissue is rarely observed or reported. To address this question, we investigated three wheat lines transformed with the GUS reporter gene. We found all three lines expressed GUS mRNA as well as beta-glucuronidase protein in their leaf and root tissues as detected by RNA gel blot, ELISA, and immunoblot analyses. However, beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity was only detected in pollen grains from the transgenic plants. Fluorometric and histochemical assays performed in the presence of wheat tissue extracts indicated that wheat leaf and root tissues contain inhibitor(s) of beta-glucuronidase activity, but pollen grains contain much lower concentrations. Further characterizations indicated that the inhibitor( s) is of low molecular weight (< 10 kDa) and is non-proteinaceous.

AB H13 is inherited as a major dominant resistance gene in wheat. It was previously mapped to chromosome 6DL and expresses a high level of antibiosis against Hessian fly (Hf) [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. The objective of this study was to identify tightly linked molecular markers for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding and as a starting point toward the map-based cloning of H13. Fifty-two chromosome 6D-specific microsatellite (simple sequence repeat) markers were tested for linkage to H13 using near-isogenic lines Molly (PI 562619) and Newton-207, and a segregating population consisting of 192 F-2:3 families derived from the cross PI 372129 (Dn4) x Molly (H13). Marker Xcfd132 co-segregated with H13, and several other markers were tightly linked to H13 in the distal region of wheat chromosome 6DS. Deletion analysis assigned H13 to a small region closely proximal to the breakpoint of del6DS-6 (FL 0.99). Further evaluation and comparison of the H13-linked markers revealed that the same chromosome region may also contain H23 in KS89WGRC03, an unnamed H gene (H-WGRC4) in KS89WGRC04, the wheat curl mite resistance gene Cmc4, and a defense response gene Ppo for polyphenol oxidase. Thus, these genes comprise a cluster of arthropod resistance genes. Marker analysis also revealed that a very small intercalary chromosomal segment carrying H13 was transferred from the H13 donor parent to the wheat line Molly.

AB Rye has one of the most efficient groups of genes for aluminum tolerance (Alt) among cultivated species of Triticeae. This tolerance is controlled by, at least, three independent and dominant loci (Alt1, Alt2, and Alt3) located on chromosome arms 6RS, 3RS, and 4RL, respectively. The segregation of Alt genes and several random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Secale cereale inter-microsatellite (SCIM), and Secale cereale microsatellite (SCM) markers in three F(2) between a tolerant cultivar (Ailes) and a non-tolerant inbred line (Riodeva) were studied. The segregation ratio obtained for aluminum tolerance in the three F(2) populations analyzed was 3:1 (tolerant:non-tolerant), indicating that tolerance is controlled by one dominant locus. SCIM811(1376) was linked to an Alt gene in the three F(2) populations studied, and three different SCIMs and one RAPD (SCIM811(1376), SCIM812(626), SCIM812(1138), and OPQ4(725)) were linked to the Alt gene in two F(2) populations. This result indicated that the same Alt gene was segregating in the three crosses. SCIM819(1434) and OPQ4(578) linked to the tolerance gene in one F(2) population were located using wheat-rye ditelosomic addition lines on the 7RS chromosome arm. The Alt locus is mapped between SCIM819(1434) and the OPQ4(578) markers. Two microsatellite loci (SCM-40 and SCM-86), previously located on chromosome 7R, were also linked to the Alt gene. Therefore, the Alt gene segregating in these F(2) populations is new and probably could be orthologous to the Alt genes located on wheat chromosome arm 4DL, on barley chromosome arm 4HL, on rye chromosome arm 4RL, and rice chromosome 3. This new Alt gene located on rye chromosome arm 7RS was named Alt4. A map of rye chromosome 7R with the Alt4 gene, 16 SCIM and RAPD, markers and two SCM markers was obtained.

AB Gliadins and glutenins are storage proteins important in determining the bread-, noodle-, and pasta-making quality of wheat. Glutenins consist of HMW and LMW subunits. The Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 loci on the short arms of chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D, respectively, are the major loci for LMW glutenins. To construct physical maps of the Glu-3 loci, a set of 24 high-density filters representing a 3.1x genome coverage hexaploid wheat BAC library was screened by hybridization using a probe made of 3 LMW glutenin sequences. After 2 rounds of hybridization, a subset of 536 BAC clones were selected and fingerprinted. Three developing seed cDNA libraries were also constructed. A total of 5000-6000 ESTs were generated from each library, assembled into contigs and searched by homology for LMW glutenin sequences. In total, 90 full-length LMW glutenin sequences were found to cluster into 8 distinct groups representing at least 21 different LMW glutenin subunits. A set of 24 pairs of PCR primers was designed from these groups and used as markers on the BAC clones. The combined fingerprinting and marker data were used to build the physical maps using FPC software. A total of 91 contigs comprising 254 clones were obtained and 282 clones remained singletons.

AB Gibberella ear rot, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, is a serious disease of corn (Zea mays) grown in northern climates. Infected corn is lower yielding and contains toxins that are dangerous to livestock and humans. Resistance to ear rot in corn is quantitative, specific to the mode of fungal entry (silk channels or kernel wounds), and highly influenced by the environment. Evaluations of ear rot resistance are complex and subjective; and they need to be repeated over several years. All of these factors have hampered attempts to develop E graminearum resistant corn varieties. The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to the genes for resistance to Gibberella ear rot. A recombinant inbred (RI) population, produced from a cross between a Gibberella ear rot resistant line (CO387) and a susceptible line (CG62), was field-inoculated and scored for Gibberella ear rot symptoms in the F-4, F-6, and F-7 generations. The distributions of disease scores were continuous, indicating that resistance is probably conditioned by multiple loci. A molecular linkage map, based on segregation in the F-5 RI population, contained 162 markers distributed over 10 linkage groups and had a total length of 2237 cM with an average distance between markers of 13.8 cM. Composite interval mapping identified I I quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Gibberella ear rot resistance following silk inoculation and 18 QTLs following kernel inoculation in 4 environments that accounted for 6.7%-35% of the total phenotypic variation. Only 2 QTLs (on linkage group 7) were detected in more than I test for silk resistance, and only I QTL (on linkage group 5) was detected in more than I test for kernel resistance, confirming the strong influence of the environment on these traits. The majority of the favorable alleles were derived from the resistant parent (CO387). The germplasm and markers for QTLs with significant phenotypic effects may be useful for marker-assisted selection to incorporate Gibberella ear rot resistance into commercial corn cultivars.

AB An Aegilops ventricosa Tausch (2n = 28, (DDNNv)-D-v-N-v-N-v) subtelocentric chromosome added to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a disomic addition line was found to carry the genes for resistance Yr17, Lr37, Sr38, and Cre5 already transferred onto chromosome 2AS of the wheat line VPM1. Previous works demonstrated that this Ae. ventricosa chromosome is translocated with respect to the standard wheat genome. The present investigations showed that this chromosome pre-existed in Ae. ventricosa and contains only chromatin specific to the N genome. Using biochemical markers and suitable cytogenetic materials including the monoisosomic addition line for the translocated long arm (6N(v)L-2N(v)S), its structure was defined as being 6N(v)Sdel.6N(v)L-2N(v)S. It consists of a segment of the short arm 2N(v), containing the resistance genes, attached to a group 6 chromosome lacking a distal part of its short arm. The 2 rearrangements could already be present in Aegilops uniaristata Vis. (2n = 14, NN), the source of the N-v genome of Ae. ventricosa.

AB Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), a clonal basidiomycete causing yellow rust disease on wheat, has a long record of 'overcoming' cultivar resistance introduced by breeders. Despite the long dispersal capacity of its spores, the French population of PST presents a strong geographical structure, with the presence of a specific pathotype (array of avirulence genes) at high frequencies in the south of France. The genetic diversity underlying this differentiation was analysed by microsatellite and AFLP markers. A total of 213 French isolates belonging to 10 pathotypes collected over a 15-year period were investigated. For each of the 12 microsatellites used, polymorphism resulted from a unique allelic variant associated to the south-specific pathotype. This pathotype was characterized by 40 specific markers over the total of 63 polymorphims detected using 15 AFLP primer combinations. Phylogeographical analysis indicated a strictly clonal structure of the population, and a strong genomic divergence between the northern population and a south-specific clone. Both virulence and molecular data show that the northern French population belongs to the northwestern European population, whereas the southern clone is most likely related to a Mediterranean population, the two subpopulations resulting from the ancient divergence of two clonal lineages. While the virulence complexity in the northern population may be explained by the successive introduction of corresponding resistance genes in cultivars, the maintenance of a simple virulence type in southern France, despite gene flow between the two populations, may be explained in terms of host cultivars repartition and local adaptation to specific host or climatic conditions.

The genetics of the resistance of KK to four isolates of M. graminicola were investigated. KK has at least five isolate-specific resistance genes including Stb6 on chromosome 3A plus a second gene for resistance to isolate IPO323, two genes on chromosome 4A, both in the region where Stb7 is located with one designated as Stb12, and a gene designated Stb10 on chromosome I D. Taken together, the widespread use of KK as a source of resistance to STB, its high resistance in field conditions, and its high susceptibility to M. graminicola isolates, which are virulent to all its resistance genes, suggest that high levels of field resistance to STB might be achieved by pyramiding several isolate-specific resistance genes.

AB The use of resistant cultivars is a most economical way to control powdery mildew (Bhuneria graminis f.sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticion aestivum L.). Identification of molecular markers closely linked to resistance genes can greatly increase the efficiency of pyramiding resistance genes in wheat cultivars. The objective of this Study was to identify molecular markers closely linked to the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm16. An F-2 population with 156 progeny was produced from the cross 'Chancellor' (susceptible) x '7028 P (resistant). A total of 45 SSR markers on chromosomes 4A and 5 B of wheat and 15 SSRs on chromosome 3 of rice was used to test the parents, as well as the resistant and susceptible bulks;, the resulting polymorphic markers were used to genotype the F2 progeny. Results indicated that the SSR marker Xgwm159, located on the short arm of chromosome 5B. is closely linked to Pm16 (genetic distance: 5.3 cm). The cytogenetical data presented in an original report, in combination with this molecular analysis, suggests that Pm16 may be located on a translocated 4A.5BS chromosome.

AB Greenbug and Russian wheat aphid (RWA) are two devastating pests of wheat. The first has a long history of new biotype emergence and, recently. RWA resistance has just started to break down. Thus, it is necessary to find new sources of resistance that will broaden the genetic base against these pests in wheat. Seventy-five doubled haploid recombinant (DHR) lines for chromosome 6A from the F I of the cross between 'Chinese Spring' and the 'Chinese Spring (Synthetic 6A) (Triticum dicoccoides x Aegilops tauschii)' substitution line were used as a mapping population for testing resistance to greenbug biotype C and to a new strain of RWA that appeared in Argentina in 2003. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for antixenosis to greenbug was significantly associated with the marker loci Xgwm10009 and Xgwm1185 located in the centromere re-ion of chromosome 6A. Another QTL which accounted for most of the amixenosis against RWA was associated with the marker loci Xgwm1293 and Xgwm1150, both located on the Iona arm of chromosome 6A. This is the first report of greenbug and RWA resistance genes located on chromosome 6A. It is also the first report of antixenosis against the new strain of RWA. As most of the RWA resistance genes present in released cultivars have been located in the D-genome. it is highly desirable to find new Sources in other genomes to combine the existing resistance genes with new Sources.

AB Lodging is a major constraint to increasing yield in many crops, but is of particular importance in the small-grained cereals. This study investigated the genetic control of lodging and component traits in wheat through the detection of underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL). The analysis was based on the identification of genomic regions which affect various traits related to lodging resistance in a population of 96 doubled haploid lines of the cross 'Milan' x 'Catbird', mapped using 126 microsatellite markers. Although major genes related to plant height (Rht genes) were responsible for increasing lodging resistance in this cross, several other traits independent of plant height were shown to be important such as root and shoot traits, and various components of plant yield. Yield components such as grain number and weight were shown to be an indicator of plant susceptibility to lodging. QTL for lodging and associated traits were found on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2B, 2D, 4B, 4D, 6D and 7D. QTL for yield and associated traits were identified on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2D, 4D and 6A.

AB Heterosis was defined as the advantage of hybrid performance over its parents in terms of growth and productivity. Previous studies showed that differential gene expression between hybrids and their parents is responsible for the heterosis; however, information on systematic identification and characterization of the differentially expressed genes are limited. In this study, an interspecific hybrid between common wheat (Triticum aestivum. L., 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) line 3338 and spelt (Triticum spelta L. 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) line 2463 was found to be highly heterotic in both aerial growth and root related traits, and was then used for expression assay. A modified suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to generate four subtracted cDNA libraries, and 748 nonreduandant cDNAs were obtained, among which 465 had high sequence similarity to the GenBank entries and represent diverse of functional categories, such as metabolism, cell growth and maintenance, signal transduction, photosynthesis, response to stress, transcription regulation and others. The expression patterns of 68.2% SSH-derived cDNAs were confirmed by reverse Northern blot, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR exhibited the similar results (72.2%). And it was concluded that the genes differentially expressed between hybrids and their parents involved in diverse physiological process pathway, which might be responsible for the observed heterosis.

   SUSCEPTIBILITY; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS
AB Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal disorder caused by adaptive and innate immune responses triggered by the gluten proteins present in wheat. In the intestine, gluten is partially degraded and modified, which results in gluten peptides that bind with high affinity to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 and trigger an inflammatory T cell response. Simultaneously, gluten exposure leads to increased production of IL15, which induces the expression of NKG2D on intraepithelial lymphocytes and its ligand MICA on epithelial cells, leading to epithelial cell destruction. The gluten-specific T cell response results in the production of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and these are specific indicators of disease. CD is one of the most common inherited diseases, the HLA-DQ locus being the major contributing genetic factor. However, as the inheritance does not follow a Mendelian segregation pattern, multiple other genes, each with relative weak effect, contribute to disease development. An important role for environmental factors, however, can not be ignored as the concordance rate in monozygous twins is considerably less than 100%. The identification of these environmental factors and susceptibility genes may allow a better understanding of disease etiology and provide diagnostic and prognostic markers. The current treatment for CD consists of a life-long gluten-free diet. Although long thought to be impossible, recent results suggest that the development of nontoxic wheat varieties may be feasible, which would aid disease prevention and provide an alternative food source for patients.

AB Habitats in agroecosystems are ephemeral, and are characterized by frequent disturbances forcing pest species to successively colonize various hosts belonging either to the cultivated or to the uncultivated part of the agricultural landscape. The role of wild habitats as reservoirs or refuges for the aphid Sitobion avenae that colonize cultivated fields was assessed by investigating the genetic structure of populations collected on both cereal crops (wheat, barley and oat) and uncultivated hosts (Yorkshire fog, cocksfoot, bulbous oatgrass and tall oatgrass) in western France.
   Classical genetic analyses and Bayesian clustering algorithms indicate that genetic differentiation is high between populations collected on uncultivated hosts and on crops, revealing a relatively limited gene flow between the uncultivated margins and the cultivated part of the agroecosystem. A closer genetic relatedness was observed between populations living on plants belonging to the same tribe (Triticeae, Poeae and Aveneae tribes) where aphid genotypes appeared not to be specialized on a single host, but rather using a group of related plant species. Causes of this ecological differentiation and its implications for integrated pest management of S. avenae as cereals pest are discussed.

AB Reduced height alleles at the Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 loci have been widely incorporated into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with the intent of improving partitioning of assimilates to grain. Although generally effective at increasing yield in high yield environments, their effects under heat and drought stress have been variable. We undertook this study to evaluate the effects of the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfing alleles in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) spring wheat population under a range of soil moisture conditions. Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 genotypes of 140 RILs derived from a cross between 'Kauz' and MTRWA116 were determined by polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The population was evaluated for yield and agronomic traits in four Colorado environments under fully irrigated, partially irrigated, and rainfed conditions in 2001 and 2002. Lines with both dwarfing alleles were significantly (P < 0.01) shorter, lower yielding, and later heading in all environments compared with lines with one or no dwarfing allele. Lines with both tall alleles performed equal to or better (P < 0.05) than all other classes for grain yield, test weight, and kernel weight in all environments. Among lines with a single dwarfing allele, those with Rht-B1b on average outyielded those with Rht-D1b in the fully irrigated environment (5432 versus 4993 kg ha-1, P < 0.05), but elsewhere their yields did not differ (P > 0.05). Desirable values for most traits occurred across a relatively wide range of plant heights, with the best performing lines either shorter lines in the tall class or taller lines in the semidwarf classes.

AB Multienvironment trials (MET) generate two types of two-way data: genotype X environment data for a target trait and genotype X trait data in individual or across environments. These data can be visually analyzed by a GGE biplot and a genotype X trait biplot, respectively. This paper describes a third type of biplot, the covariate-effect biplot, and illustrates its tandem use with the other biplots to achieve a fuller understanding of MET data. The covariate-effect biplot is generated on the basis of an explanatory trait X environment two-way table consisting of correlation coefficients between the target trait (e.g., yield) and each of the other traits in each of the environments. This biplot displays the yield-trait relations in individual environments and addresses whether and how the genotype X environment interactions (GE) for yield can be explored by indirect selection for the other traits. These other traits are treated as genetic covariables and can be replaced by other genetic covariables such as genetic markers, QTL, or genes. The biplot methodology was demonstrated by MET data of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) conducted across North America. Both the GGE biplot and the covariate-effect biplot showed that the environments fell into two (eastern vs. western) megaenvironments. The covariate-effect pattern explained 81% of the GGE pattern, suggesting that the GE pattern for yield can be effectively explored by indirect selection for these traits. Specifically, barley yield can be improved by selecting for larger kernel weight, earlier heading, and better lodging resistance in the eastern megaenvironment. In contrast, the yield-trait relationship in the western megaenvironment was highly variable, and yield improvement can be achieved only by selecting for yield per se across environments. We suggest that the GGE biplot, the genotype X trait biplot, and the covariate-effect biplot be used jointly to better understand and more fully explore MET data.

It is possible that the Lvl 1 gene also determines gel-protein weight, although this could be the effect of a closely associated gene. A quantitative trait locus, which is likely to be a single gene controlling Hagberg Failing Number, was also located close to the centromere. Finally, the location of a gene (or genes) affecting gel-protein G' (elastic modulus) could not be established but it may be located distally on the long arm, but proximal to the marker Xgwm 480. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat worldwide. Lr16 is a widely deployed leaf rust resistance gene effective at the seedling stage. Although virulence to Lr16 exists in the Canadian P. triticina population, Lr16 provides a level of partial resistance in the field. The primary objective of this study was to identify markers linked to Lr16 that are suitable for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Lr16 was tagged with microsatellite markers on the distal end of chromosome 2BS in three mapping populations. Seven microsatellite loci mapped within 10 cM of Lr16, with the map distances varying among populations. Xwmc764 was the closest microsatellite locus to Lr16, and mapped 1, 9, and 3 cM away in the RL4452/AC Domain, BW278/AC Foremost, and HY644/McKenzie mapping populations, respectively. Lr16 was the terminal locus mapped in all three populations. Xwmc764, Xgwm210, and Xwmc661 were the most suitable markers for selection of Lr16 because they had simple PCR profiles, numerous alleles, high polymorphism information content (PIC), and were tightly linked to Lr16. Twenty-eight spring wheat lines were evaluated for leaf rust reaction with the P. triticina virulence phenotypes MBDS, MBRJ, and MGBJ, and analyzed with five microsatellite markers tightly linked to Lr16. There was good agreement between leaf rust infection type (IT) data and the microsatellite allele data. Microsatellite markers were useful for postulating Lr16 in wheat lines with multiple leaf rust resistance genes.

AB VRN-2 is a dominant repressor of flowering that plays a central role in the vernalization pathway of wheat. This gene is a zinc-finger/CCT domain transcription factor (ZCCT-1) down-regulated by vernalization. In barley, there are three related and linked ZCCT genes designated VRN-H1a, b, and c. A deletion of these three genes was observed in six putative spring induced mutants from winter barley variety 'Chikurin Ibaraki I'. However, analysis of additional molecular markers demonstrated that these deletions were originated by outcrossing with a spring barley variety carrying the natural ZCCT deletion. Hybridization of Southern blots from 84 barley varieties with a wheat ZCCT1 probe showed three or more fragments in 23 winter varieties but none in 60 out of the 61 vrn-H2 spring varieties. The vrn-H2-spring barley variety 'Fan' showed only the ZCCT-Hb gene, suggesting that this gene is not sufficient to determine winter growth habit in barley. We also show in this study, that the effect of VRN-H2 on flowering time completely disappears in the presence of the dominant Vrn-H1 allele in a Morex x Hordeum spontaneum segregating population. A different result was described before for the epistatic interactions between the orthologous genes in diploid wheat. We discuss the possible causes of these differences.

AB To examine the performance and information content of different marker systems, comparative assessment of population genetic diversity was undertaken in nine populations of Athyrium distentifolium using nine genomic and 10 expressed sequence tag (EST) microsatellite (SSR) loci, and 265 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci from two primer combinations. In range-wide comparisons (European vs. North American populations), the EST-SSR loci showed more reliable amplification and produced more easily scorable bands than genomic simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genomic SSRs showed significantly higher levels of allelic diversity than EST-SSRs, but there was a significant correlation in the rank order of population diversities revealed by both marker types. When AFLPs, genomic SSRs, and EST-SSRs are considered, comparisons of different population diversity metrics/markers revealed a mixture of significant and nonsignificant rank-order correlations. However, no hard incongruence was detected (in no pairwise comparison of populations did different marker systems or metrics detect opposingly significant different amounts of variation). Comparable population pairwise estimates of F-ST were obtained for all marker types, but whilst absolute values for genomic and EST-SSRs were very similar (F-ST = 0.355 and 0.342, respectively), differentiation was consistently higher for AFLPs in pairwise and global comparisons (global AFLP F-ST = 0.496). The two AFLP primer combinations outperformed 18 SSR loci in assignment tests and discriminatory power in phenetic cluster analyses. The results from marker comparisons on A. distentifolium are discussed in the context of the few other studies on natural plant populations comparing microsatellite and AFLP variability.

AB Model plants are facilitating the genetic characterization and comparative mapping of a number of traditional crops. Medicago truncatula has been widely accepted as a model plant to this end as it provides the essential tools for multiple aspects of legume genetics and genomics. A large set of markers from highly conserved M. truncatula gene regions is being created and used to establish a worldwide framework for comparative genomic studies in legumes. We have investigated the potential for cross-species amplification of 209 expressed sequence tag (EST)-based and 33 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based microsatellites from M. truncatula in the three most important European legume pulses-pea, faba bean and chickpea-that might facilitate future comparative mapping. Our results revealed significant transferability of M. truncatula microsatellites to the three pulses (40% in faba bean, 36.3% in chickpea and 37.6% in pea). The percentage of M. truncatula EST-SSRs (simple sequence repeats) amplified in the three crops (39-43%) was twofold higher than that of the genomic SSRs (21-24%). Sequence analysis determined that the level of conservation in the microsatellite motif was very low, while the flanking regions were generally well conserved. The variations in the sequences were mainly due to changes in the number of repeat motifs in the microsatellite region combined with indel and base substitutions. None of the functional microsatellites showed direct polymorphism among the parental genotypes tested, consequently preventing their immediate use for mapping purposes.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, caused by Fusarium graminearum, is an important fungal disease in many wheat-growing areas of the world. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationship between width and duration of flower opening and incidence of FHB in wheat, and to identify DNA markers associated with narrow flower opening and low FHB incidence. It was hypothesized that wheat lines whose flowers open briefly and narrowly have a reduced risk of infection. To test the hypothesis, we crossed wheat cultivars Patterson and Goldfield to generate a population of 100 random F-2-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Florets of Patterson open wide; florets of Goldfield tend to stay closed. The population of RILs was characterized for FHB incidence and flower opening width (FOW) and duration in the F-7:9 and F-7:10 generations. Of the 305 simple sequence repeat primer pairs screened on the parents, 79 amplified polymorphic DNA bands. Pooled DNA from each of the two bulks was tested with these 79 SSR primer pairs. Four markers were found to have significant marker-trait association with low FHB incidence and narrow flower opening. The major QTL effect associated with narrow flower opening and low FHB incidence was found between the map interval Xbarc200-Xgwm210, explaining 29% of the phenotypic variation for FHB incidence averaged over six replicated tests in Indiana in 2002 and 2003. This adds credence to the hypothesis that narrow flower opening is responsible for low FHB incidence in this population. Breeding wheat lines for both morphological avoidance, such as narrow flower opening, and physiological resistance to FHB may be valuable in future breeding research to reduce crop production and grain quality losses in wheat due to FHB.

AB A major QTL for grain dormancy, QPhs.ocs-3A.1, derived from the highly dormant wheat Zenkoujikomugi (Zen), has been identified in a study made under a controlled environment. Further investigations were needed to dissect the precise position and expression of QPhs.ocs-3A.1 under different field conditions because the ability to detect genetic loci for grain dormancy traits is compromised by environmental effects and genotype/environment interactions. Group 4 chromosomes have also been shown to be possible sites of QTLs for grain dormancy. The objectives of this study were (1) to locate additional molecular markers in the QPhs.ocs-3A.1 region, (2) to identify QTLs on the group 4 chromosomes and (3) to elucidate their combined effects. We examined the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between Chinese Spring (CS) and Zen over a 3-year period in one location and 1 year in a different location. In an interval mapping study QPhs.ocs-3A.1 was mapped to within the 4.6 cM region flanked by Xbarc310 and Xbcd907 at the proximal end of the short arm of chromosome 3A. QPhs.ocs-3A.1 was confirmed to be the predominant dormancy QTL since it explained a large portion (11.6-44.8%) of the phenotypic variation, and was strongly displayed under dormancy-breaking conditions or at low germination temperatures. For QPhs.ocs-4A.1, identified on the long arm of chromosome 4A, and QPhs.ocs-4B.1, on the centromeric region of the long arm of Chr 4B, the LOD peak positions and the desirable allele were consistent between the trials, while the LOD scores and contribution to the phenotypic variation varied. Transgressive segregants were observed among the 125 RILs and most of them had a combination of the three alleles conferring a higher dormancy: the Zen alleles at QPhs.ocs-3A.1 and QPhs.ocs-4A.1 and the CS allele at QPhs.ocs-4B1. This demonstrated a combined effect of the desirable alleles on accelerating grain dormancy, with their total effect being superior to that of Zen.

AB Host-plant resistance is the most economically viable and environmentally responsible method of control for Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of leaf rust in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The identification and utilization of new resistance sources is critical to the continued development of improved cultivars as shifts in pathogen races cause the effectiveness of widely deployed genes to be short lived. The objectives of this research were to identify and tag new leaf rust resistance genes. Forty landraces from Afghanistan and Iran were obtained from the National Plant Germplasm System and evaluated under field conditions at two locations in Texas. PI 289824, a landrace from Iran, was highly resistant under field infection. Further evaluation revealed that PI 289824 is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of leaf rust races, including the currently prevalent races of leaf rust in the Great Plains area of the USA. Eight F-1 plants, 176 F-2 individuals and 139 F-2:3 families of a cross between PI 289824 and T112 (susceptible) were evaluated for resistance to leaf rust at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis indicated resistance in PI 289824 is controlled by a single dominant gene. The AFLP analyses resulted in the identification of a marker (P39 M48-367) linked to resistance. The diagnostic AFLP band was sequenced and that sequence information was used to develop an STS marker (TXW200) linked to the gene at a distance of 2.3 cM. The addition of microsatellite markers allowed the gene to be mapped to the short arm of Chromosome 5B. The only resistance gene to be assigned to Chr 5BS is Lr52. The Lr52 gene was reported to be 16.5 cM distal to Xgwm443 while the gene in PI 289824 mapped 16.7 cM proximal to Xgwm443. Allelism tests are needed to determine the relationship between the gene in PI 289824 and Lr52. If the reported map positions are correct, the gene in PI 289824 is unique.

AB A considerable array of genomic resources are in place in pearl millet, and marker-aided selection is already in use in the public breeding programme at ICRISAT. This paper describes experiments to extend these publicly available resources to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based marker system. A new marker system, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)-SNP, was developed using annotated rice genomic sequences to initially predict the intron-exon borders in millet expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and then to design primers that would amplify across the introns. An adequate supply of millet ESTs was available for us to identify 299 homologues of single-copy rice genes in which the intron positions could be precisely predicted. PCR primers were then designed to amplify approximately 500-bp genomic fragments containing introns. Analysis of these fragments on SSCP gels revealed considerable polymorphism. A detailed DNA sequence analysis of variation at four of the SSCP-SNP loci over a panel of eight inbred genotypes showed complex patterns of variation, with about one SNP or indel (insertion-deletion) every 59 bp in the introns, but considerably fewer in the exons. About two- thirds of the variation was derived from SNPs and one-third from indels. Most haplotypes were detected by SSCP. As a marker system, SSCP-SNP has lower development costs than simple sequence repeats (SSRs), because much of the work is in silico, and similar deployment costs and through-put potential. The rates of polymorphism were lower but useable, with a mean PIC of 0.49 relative to 0.72 for SSRs in our eight inbred genotype panel screen. The major advantage of the system is in comparative applications. Syntenic information can be used to target SSCP-SNP markers to specific chromosomal regions or, conversely, SSCP-SNP markers can be used to unravel detailed syntenic relationships in specific parts of the genome. Finally, a preliminary analysis showed that the millet SSCP-SNP primers amplified in other cereals with a success rate of about 50%. There is also considerable potential to promote SSCP-SNP to a COS (conserved orthologous set) marker system for application across species by more specifically designing primers to precisely match the model genome sequence.

AB H9, H10, and H11 are major dominant resistance genes in wheat, expressing antibiosis against Hessian fly [(Hf) Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. Previously, H9 and H10 were assigned to chromosome 5A and H11 to 1A. The objectives of this study were to identify simple-sequence-repeat (SSR) markers for fine mapping of these genes and for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. Contrary to previous results, H9 and H10 did not show linkage with SSR markers on chromosome 5A. Instead, H9, H10, and H11 are linked with SSR markers on the short arm of chromosome 1A. Both H9 and H10 are tightly linked to flanking markers Xbarc263 and Xcfa2153 within a genetic distance of 0.3-0.5 cM. H11 is tightly linked to flanking markers Xcfa2153 and Xbarc263 at genetic distances of 0.3 cM and 1.7 cM. Deletion bin mapping assigned these markers and genes to the distal 14% of chromosome arm 1AS, where another Hf-resistance gene, Hdic (derived from emmer wheat), was also mapped previously. Marker polymorphism results indicated that a small terminal segment of chromosome 1AS containing H9 or H10 was transferred from the donor parent to the wheat lines Iris or Joy, and a small intercalary fragment carrying H11 was transferred from the resistant donor to the wheat line Karen. Our results suggest that H9, H10, H11, Hdic, and the previously identified H9- or H11-linked genes (H3, H5, H6, H12, H14, H15, H16, H17, H19, H28, and H29) may compose a cluster (or family) of Hf-resistance genes in the distal gene-rich region of wheat chromosome 1AS; and H10 most likely is the same gene as H9.

AB Analysis of genetic diversity changes in existing gene pools of cultivated crops is important for understanding the impact of plant breeding on crop genetic diversity and developing effective indicators for genetic diversity of cultivated plants. The objective of this study was to assess genetic diversity changes in 75 Canadian hard red wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars released from 1845 to 2004 using 31 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. A total of 267 SSR alleles were detected, and their allelic frequencies ranged from 0.01 to 0.97, with an average of 0.14. Significant allelic reduction was observed at only four SSR loci for the cultivars released from 1970 onwards. However, 51 alleles (about 19%) present in pre-1910 cultivars were undetected in cultivars released after 1990 and were spread over 27 SSR loci. The proportion of SSR variation accounted for by six breeding periods was 12.5%, by four ancestral families, 16.5%, and by eight breeding programs, 8.4%. The average genetic diversity measured by three different band-sharing methods did not change significantly among cultivars released from different breeding periods, breeding programs, and ancestral families. However, genetic shift was obvious in the cultivars released over the six breeding periods, reflecting well the various breeding efforts over years. These results clearly show the allelic reduction and genetic shift in the Canadian hard red spring wheat germplasm released over time. Consequently, more effort needs to be made to broaden the wheat breeding base and conserve wheat germplasm.

AB We cloned a polyketide synthase gene (pks12) from Fusarium graminearum, a devastating fungal pathogen of cereals. Transformation-mediated gene disruption led to an easily detectable albino phenotype of the disruptants. We used the disruption of the pks12 gene as a visible marker for transformation-mediated homologous recombination and optimized the transformation procedure to achieve a high rate of homologous recombination. In combination with the published genomic sequence data and the generation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for F graminearum, this is a useful tool to investigate this important plant pathogen on a molecular level. Optimized transformation of F graminearum resulted in at least 93% homologous recombination events when the homologous genomic DNA fragment in the vector had a size of approximately 800 bp and was linearized in the middle. Using a genomic sequence of approximately 500 bp in the transformation vector, 70% of the transformants still exhibited homologous recombination. On the Contrary, no more than 10% homologous recombination events were observed when less than 400 bp DNA fragments were used. We co-transformed F. graminearum with two different vectors. One vector harboured a DNA insert homologous to the pks12 gene, while the other vector consisted of the same vector backbone carrying the selection marker specific for F graminearum. About 70% of the transformants had a disrupted pks12 gene, and all of these showed an integration of the second vector into the pks disruption vector. Therefore, the time-consuming construction of a single transformation vector can be avoided; furthermore, it is now easily feasible to express a gene construct at a defined and mutated genomic, site.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most important fungal wheat diseases worldwide. Understanding the genetics of FHB resistance is the key to facilitating the introgression of different FHB resistance genes into adapted wheat. The objectives of the present study were to detect and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with FHB resistance genes and characterize the genetic components of the QTL in a doubled-haploid (DH) spring wheat population using both single-locus and two-locus analysis. A mapping population, consisting of 174 DH lines from the cross between DH181 (resistant) and AC Foremost (susceptible), was evaluated for type I resistance to initial infection during a 2-year period in spray-inoculated field trials, for Type 11 resistance to fungal spread within the spike in 3 greenhouse experiments using single-floret inoculation, and for resistance to kernel infection in a 2001 field trial. One-locus QTL analysis revealed 7 QTL for type I resistance on chromosome arms 2DS, 3AS, 3BS, 3BC (centromeric), 4DL, 5AS, and 6BS, 4 QTL for type II resistance on chromosomes 2DS, 3BS, 6BS, and 7BL, and 6 QTL for resistance to kernel infection on chromosomes 1DL, 2DS, 3BS, 3BC, 4DL, and 6BS. Two-locus QTL analysis detected 8 QTL with main effects and 4 additive by additive epistatic interactions for FHB resistance and identified novel FHB resistance genes for the first time on chromosomes 1DL, 4AL, and 4DL. Neither significant QTL by environment interactions nor epistatic QTL by environment interactions were found for either type I or type II resistance. The additive effects of QTL explained most of the phenotypic variance for FHB resistance. Marker-assisted selection for the favored alleles at multiple genomic regions appears to be a promising tool to accelerate the introgression and pyramiding of different FHB resistance genes into adapted wheat genetic backgrounds.

AB Stripe rust is one of the most important diseases of wheat and barley worldwide. On wheat it is caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and on barley by P striiformis f. sp. hordei. Most wheat genotypes are resistant to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and most barley genotypes are resistant to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. To determine the genetics of resistance in wheat to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, crosses were made between wheat genotypes Lemhi (resistant to P striiformis f. sp. hordei) and PI 478214 (susceptible to P striiformis f. sp. hordei). The greenhouse seedling test of 150 F-2 progeny from the Lemhi x PI 478214 cross, inoculated with race PSH-14 of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, indicated that Lemhi has a dominant resistance gene. The single dominant gene was confirmed by testing seedlings of the F-1, BC1 to the two parents, and 150 F-3 lines front the F-2 plants with the same race. The tests of the F-1, BC1, and F-3 progeny with race PSH-48 of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and PST-21 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici also showed a dominant gene for resistance to these races. Cosegregation analyses of the F3 data from the tests with the two races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and one race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici suggested that the same gene conferred the resistance to both races of P striiformis f. sp. hordei, and this gene was different but closely linked to Yr21, a previously reported gene in Lemhi conferring resistance to race PST-21 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. A linkage group consisting of 11 resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers was established for the genes. The gene was confirmed to be on chromosome 1B by amplification of a set of nullitetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with an RGAP marker linked in repulsion with the resistance allele. The genetic information obtained from this study is useful in understanding interactions between inappropriate hosts and pathogens. The gene identified in Lemhi for resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei should provide resistance to barley stripe rust when introgressed into barley cultivars.

AB Fifty-two wheat cultivars and breeding lines, most of which have been used in breeding programmes worldwide, were tested for isolate-specific resistance to Mycosphaerella graminicola isolate IPO323, which interacts with the Stb6 gene of wheat (first identified in cvs Flame and Hereward) via a gene-for-gene relationship. Twenty-three lines were specifically resistant to this isolate. Sixteen resistant lines were crossed with Flame for a test of allelism. All progeny lines were resistant, suggesting that the 16 parental lines had Stb6, a gene allelic to it or a gene closely linked to it. In 14 lines, resistance to IPO323 was controlled by Stb6 only. An exception was Kavkaz-K4500 L6.A.4., which has two genes for resistance to IPO323, one of which is Stb6. The microsatellite marker Xgwm369 was used to examine genetic diversity in the region of the genome containing Stb6, to which it is closely linked. Eleven alleles of Xgwm369, with amplified fragments of 10 different sizes, as well as apparent nonamplification of this marker in Bulgaria 88, were detected. Through the use of information about lines' ancestry, combined with Xgwm369 alleles, it was shown that Stb6 entered world wheat-breeding programmes on a minimum of six occasions, and possibly from as many as 11 sources. The presence of Stb6 in both European and Chinese landraces suggests that this gene has been present in cultivated wheat since the earliest times of agriculture.

AB Vernalization requirement is an important trait in temperate crop plants such as wheat and must be considered when selecting varieties for cultivation under different climatic conditions. To determine the growth habit of wheat varieties, plants need to be grown under different vernalization regimes, a lengthy but necessary process for breeders involved in crossing winter with spring germplasm. If haplotypes can be associated with growth habit, then molecular marker assays that are reliable, cheap, and quick can be developed to assist in the selection of plants with the desired phenotype. We have analyzed 81 accessions that have different vernalization requirements and putative different origins of spring habit for sequence variation at the Apetala1 (AP1) locus, which underlies Vrn-1, and at the linked Phytochrome C (PhyC) locus. Good correspondence was found between the AP1 genotype and the PhyC haplotype for 77 of the 81 accessions. Two varieties displayed a recombination event between the AP1 and PhyC loci, and one variety carried a recombinant PhyC gene. In addition, one variety carried an apparent AP1 winter allele, but displayed the Vrn-A1 spring habit. The PhyC haplotype for this variety also indicated the presence of a Vrn-A1 spring allele. Our data suggest that both the AP1 promoter region and PhyC SNPs can be used as diagnostic markers for vernalization response at the vrn-A1 locus, but that neither are perfect tags.

AB We report the genetics of resistance of the Portuguese wheat breeding line TE 9111 to septoria tritici blotch (STB), which is caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola. TE 9111 is the most resistant line known in Europe and combines isolate-non-specific, partial resistance with several isolate-specific resistances. We show that, in addition to high levels of partial resistance to STB, TE 9111 has a new gene for resistance to M. graminicola isolate IPO90012, named Stb11, that maps on chromosome 1BS, the Stb6 gene for resistance to isolate IPO323 and, probably, the Stb7 gene for resistance to isolate IPO87019. All of these genes are closely linked to microsatellite markers, which can be used for marker-assisted selection. TE 9111 may therefore be a valuable source of resistance to STB for wheat breeding, especially in Mediterranean environments.

AB Grain hardness is one of the most important quality characteristics of cultivated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and has been reported to result from either a failure to express puroindoline a (Pina) or single-nucleotide mutations in puroindoline b (Pinb). Up to now, seven alleles from Pinb-D1a to Pinb-D1g were identified in bread wheat. Compared to the DNA coding region of Pinb-D1a (allele for softness), six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in six alleles for Pinb-D1. In this study, we used pyrosequencing technology to develop two SNP assays for identification of the seven Pinb alleles and characterized SNP variations in the Pinb of 493 European wheat varieties. Of the three hardness alleles Pinb-D1b, Pinb-D1c, and Pinb-D1d detected in this study, Pinb-D1b was the most predominant hardness allele in European hard wheats. The hardness genotypes of partial German wheat varieties available confirmed the reliability and validation of the SNP assays developed for the Pinb locus. Therefore, pyrosequencing technology offers an efficient, precise, and reliable concept for high-throughout genotyping to assist selection of grain hardness genes in wheat quality breeding programs.

AB Duration from sowing to flowering is of critical importance for crop adaptation. Breeding for the optimal flowering time is one of the major factors, which confer maximal yields in a given environment. The timing of flowering is modulated primarily by responsiveness to photoperiod and temperature, and there are large differences in sensitivity among genotypes. In most spring wheat cultivars the duration of the vegetative period is strongly influenced by genes controlling photoperiod response. In this paper we report the photoperiod responses of a set of 'Chinese Spring' substitution and partial deletion lines of homoeologous group 2 chromosomes studied under natural short days. We confirmed the presence of dominant genes Ppd1 and Ppd2 on chromosomes 2D and 2B, respectively, and compared the effects of Ppd1 and Ppd2 for daylength response. The photoperiodic responses of partial chromosome deletion lines of 'Chinese Spring' allowed us to map Ppd2 physically between breakpoints 0.27 and 0.53 of the short arm of chromosome 2B. This result is consistent with the finding of a possible location of Ppd2 based on molecular marker studies. A dosage effect of the dominant gene Ppd2 was shown.

AB Many wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landrace cultivars (LCs) conserved in seed banks are not sufficiently characterized to inspire breeders' interest for their efficient exploitation. Patterns of genetic variation within and among wheat LCs are usually unknown. Two sets of wheat LCs stored in CIMMYT's plant genetic resources center were assessed for genetic diversity by means of 76 (Set 1) and 44 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (Set 2). Set 1 included 36 LC accessions originating from different countries, either collected as bulks, composed of a single LC subline, or an unknown collection method. Set 2 consisted of three to 25 sublines of five Mexican and four Turkish LCs already included in Set 1. In a principal coordinate analysis based on modified Rogers' distance (MRD), only three Turkish LC accessions formed a distinct cluster in Set 1. The Mexican accessions clustered together with a Spanish accession and a close relationship between a Chilean and Nigerian accession was observed. In Set 2, gene diversity (H-e) among the Turkish LCs (0.43) was higher than among the Mexican LCs (0.35). Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed considerable genetic diversity within Mexican (52.7%) and within Turkish (67.6%) LCs. Pairwise fixation indices (F-ST) were significant, except between two Turkish LCs. Results were discussed in relation to the most suitable collection method of wheat LCs (bulk or individual sublines) as well as to the use of SSRs as a tool for seed bank management.

AB New leaf rust resistance genes are needed in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to provide additional sources of resistance to the highly variable and dynamic leaf rust pathogen Puccinia triticina Eriks. Leaf rust resistance gene Lr51, located within a segment of Triticum speltoides Taush chromosome IS translocated to the long arm of chromosome 1B of bread wheat, is resistant to the current predominant races of leaf rust in the USA. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic length of the translocated IS segment, develop a PCR marker for Lr51, and use this marker to generate isogenic lines for this gene. Characterization of two translocation lines (F-7-3 and F-7-12) with 10 molecular markers indicated that F-7-3 has an interstitial T. speltoides chromosome segment of 14 to 32 cM long including loci XAga7 and Xmwg710, whereas line F-7-12 has a complex series of translocations among chromosomes of homeologous group 1. On the basis of the DNA sequence of the A, B, D, and S alleles of the XAga7 locus, we designed a cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker for the S genome allele. Primers S30-13L and AGA7-759R preferentially amplified the XAga7 1S (819 bp) and 1B alleles (783 bp). These amplification products can be separated in agarose gels after digestion with PstI or BamHI restriction enzymes. This CAPS marker was validated in a collection of 32 common wheat cultivars and was used to develop three pairs of hard red spring isogenic lines from the donor parent F-7-3. These isogenic lines will be valuable for future assessment of the effect of this chromosome introgression on agronomic performance and end-use quality.

AB Slow leaf-rusting resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L) is gaining acceptance as a breeding objective because of its durability in comparison with race-specific resistance. CI 13227 was previously reported to provide the highest level of slow leaf-rusting resistance. The objective of this study was to characterize the slow leaf-rusting resistance conferred by CI 13227 using molecular markers. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from CI 13227/Suwon 92 was evaluated for final severity (FS), area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), infection rate (IR), and infection duration (ID) of leaf rust. Four hundred fifty-nine amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and 28 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were analyzed in the population. Two quantitative trait loci (QTL), designated as QLr.osu-2B and QLr.osu-7BL, were consistently associated with AUDPC, FS, and IR of leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina (previously P. recondita Rob. Ex Desm. f. sp. tritici). The percentages of phenotypic variance explained by each QTL varied with experiments and traits, ranging from 13.4 to 18.8% for AUDPC, 12.5 to 20.8% for FS, and 12.9 to 16.1% for IR. The third QTL for leaf rust ID, designated as QLrid.osu-2DS, was located on chromosome 2DS and explained 26.4 and 21.47% of the phenotypic variance in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Both the QTL and correlation analysis indicate reasonable progress in leaf-rusting resistance by selecting for final severity. SSR markers closely associated with QLr.osu-2B or QLr.osu-7BL have potential to be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for durable leaf rust resistant cultivars.

AB Effective pest management is greatly facilitated by knowledge of the genetic structure and host adaptation of the pest species in question. The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) (Homoptera: Aphididae: Macrosiphini), is an important economic pest in many cereal-growing areas of the world, and in this study we investigated these aspects of its populations, using microsatellite markers and host plant response assays. Diuraphis noxia was sampled from 38 locations in Iran and genotyped at four polymorphic microsatellite loci that had been isolated from various Sitobion species. We identified 50 multilocus genotypes in 376 individuals. The overall observed heterozygosity was 0.134. F-statistics showed a regional partitioning in D. noxia populations with overall F(ST) = 0.231. In addition, there was a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances. In order to test for the ecological consequences of genetic variability in D. noxia, biotypic variation amongst the isolates collected from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was evaluated on a number of resistant and susceptible wheat varieties. The plant variables we measured were damage rating (based on leaf chlorosis, leaf rolling, wilting, and death of the host plant), host plant dry weight, and root length. Damage rating was the best criterion for detecting biotypic variation in D. noxia. Discriminant analysis correctly classified the isolates in respective groups in 80-91.8% of the cases. The barley isolate showed no differences in performance on resistant and susceptible wheat, indicating a lack of gene-by-gene relationship with wheat plants. In contrast, wheat isolates differentially damaged the resistant and susceptible plants and showed moderate to severe virulence.

AB The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to locate Secale cereale (inter-simple sequence repeat ISSR) or Secale cereale inter-microsatellite (SCIM) markers using wheat-rye addition lines in order to develop a set of molecular markers distributed on the seven rye chromosomes. The number of SCIM markers located on 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R and 7R chromosomes were 4, 3, 12, 3, 2, 9 and 8, respectively. Therefore, a total of 41 new SCIMs were located on the seven rye chromosomes. The segregation of the 63 different SCIM markers in three different F-2 was studied. The observed ISSR segregations were the 3:1 (50.7%), the 15:1 (12.7%) and the 1:1 (14.2%). The linkage analysis carried out indicated that seven of the segregating SCIMs were linked to chromosome 7R and two were linked to chromosome 4R. The use of the SCIM markers as a source of molecular markers that could be linked to interesting genes or other important agronomic traits is discussed.

AB Transgenic plants of triticale cv. Wanad were obtained after transformation using three combinations of strain/vectors. Two of them were hypervirulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (AGL1 and EHA101) with vectors containing bar under maize ubiquitin 1 promoter (pDM805), and both hpt under p35S and nptII under pnos (pGAH). The third one was a regular LBA4404 strain containing super-binary plasmid pTOK233 with selection genes the same as in pGAH. The efficiency of transformation was from 0 to 16% and it was dependent on the selection factor, auxin pretreatment, and the strain/vector combination. The highest number of transgenic plants was obtained after transformation with LBA4404(pTOK233) and kanamycin selection. Pretreatment of explants with picloram led to the highest number of plants obtained after transformation with both Agrobacterium/vector systems LBA4404(pTOK233) and EHA101(pGAH) and selected with kanamycin. Transgenic character of selected plants was examined by PCR using specific primers for bar, gus, nptII, and hpt and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization analysis. There was no GUS expression in To transgenic plants transformed with gus under p35S. However the GUS expression was detectable in the progeny of some lines. Only 30% of 46 transgenic lines showed Mendelian segregation of GUS expressing to GUS not expressing plants. In the remaining 70% the segregation was non-Mendelian and the rate was much lower than 3: 1. Factors that might effect expression of transgenes in allohexaploid monocot species are discussed.

   ACCESSIONS
AB The broad adaptability of wheat and barley is in part attributable to their flexible growth habit, in that spring forms have recurrently evolved from the ancestral winter growth habit. In diploid wheat and barley growth habit is determined by allelic variation at the VRN-1 and/or VRN-2 loci, whereas in the polyploid wheat species it is determined primarily by allelic variation at VRN-1. Dominant Vrn-A1 alleles for spring growth habit are frequently associated with mutations in the promoter region in diploid wheat and in the A genome of common wheat. However, several dominant Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1 (common wheat) and Vrn-H1 (barley) alleles show no polymorphisms in the promoter region relative to their respective recessive alleles. In this study, we sequenced the complete VRN-1 gene from these accessions and found that all of them have large deletions within the first intron, which overlap in a 4-kb region. Furthermore, a 2.8-kb segment within the 4-kb region showed high sequence conservation among the different recessive alleles. PCR markers for these deletions showed that similar deletions were present in all the accessions with known Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 alleles, and in 51 hexaploid spring wheat accessions previously shown to have no polymorphisms in the VRN-A1 promoter region. Twenty-four tetraploid wheat accessions had a similar deletion in VRN-A1 intron 1. We hypothesize that the 2.8-kb conserved region includes regulatory elements important for the vernalization requirement. Epistatic interactions between VRN-H2 and the VRN-H1 allele with the intron 1 deletion suggest that the deleted region may include a recognition site for the flowering repression mediated by the product of the VRN-H2 gene of barley.

AB We introduced the rice chitinase (Cht-2; RCC2) gene into calli of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), with a hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) gene as a selectable marker, by particle bombardment. Hygromycin-resistant calli were selected and transferred to regeneration medium for shoot formation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed regenerants containing the HPT gene. The RCC2 gene was detected in 65.5% of those regenerants. Southern hybridization detected both HPT and RCC2 genes and indicated that the transgenic plants were independently transformed. Expression of the RCC2 gene in the transgenic plants was confirmed by Northern hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting. Bioassay of detached leaves indicated increased resistance to crown rust (Puccinia coronata) in transgenic plants, which exhibited higher chitinase activity than a nontransgenic plant.

AB Using barley and wheat expressed sequence tags as well as rice genomic sequence and mapping information, we revisited the genomic region encompassing the self-incompatibility (SI) locus Z on rye chromosome 2RL applying a comparative approach. We were able to arrange 12 novel sequence-tagged site (STS) markers around Z, spanning a genetic distance of 32.3 cM, with the closest flanking markers mapping at a distance of 0.5 cM and 1.0 cM from Z, respectively, and one marker cosegregating with Z, in a testcross population of 204 progeny. Two overlapping rice bacterial artifical chromosomes ( BACs), OSJNBa0070O11 and OSJNBa0010D21, were found to carry rice orthologs of the three rye STS markers from the 1.5-cM interval encompassing Z. The STS-marker orthologs on these rice BACs span less than 125,000 bp of the rice genome. The STS marker TC116908 cosegregated with Z in a mapping population and revealed a high degree of polymorphism among a random sample of rye plants of various origin. TC116908 was shown via Southern hybridization to correspond to gene no. 10 (OSJNBa0070O11.10) on rice BAC OSJNBa0070O11. Reverse transcription-PCR with a TC116908-specific primer pair resulted in the amplification of a fragment of the expected size from the rye pistil but not from leaf cDNA. OSJNBa0070O11.10 was found to show a highly significant sequence similarity to AtUBP22, a ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP). TC116908 likely represents a putative UBP gene that is specifically expressed in rye pistils and cosegregates with Z. Given that the ubiquitination of proteins is emerging as a general mechanism involved in different SI systems of plants, TC116908 appears to be a promising target for further investigation with respect to its relation to the SI system of the grasses.

AB A population of 96 doubled haploid lines (DHLs) was prepared from F-1 plants of the hexaploid wheat cross Chinese Spring x SQ1 (a high abscisic acid-expressing breeding line) and was mapped with 567 RFLP, AFLP, SSR, morphological and biochemical markers covering all 21 chromosomes, with a total map length of 3,522 cM. Although the map lengths for each genome were very similar, the D genome had only half the markers of the other two genomes. The map was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and yield components from a combination of 24 site x treatment x year combinations, including nutrient stress, drought stress and salt stress treatments. Although yield QTLs were widely distributed around the genome, 17 clusters of yield QTLs from five or more trials were identified: two on group 1 chromosomes, one each on group 2 and group 3, five on group 4, four on group 5, one on group 6 and three on group 7. The strongest yield QTL effects were on chromosomes 7AL and 7BL, due mainly to variation in grain numbers per ear. Three of the yield QTL clusters were largely site-specific, while four clusters were largely associated with one or other of the stress treatments. Three of the yield QTL clusters were coincident with the dwarfing gene Rht-B1 on 4BS and with the vernalisation genes Vrn-A1 on 5AL and Vrn-D1 on 5DL. Yields of each DHL were calculated for trial mean yields of 6 g plant(-1) and 2 g plant(-1) (equivalent to about 8 t ha(-1) and 2.5 t ha(-1), respectively), representing optimum and moderately stressed conditions. Analyses of these yield estimates using interval mapping confirmed the group-7 effects on yield and, at 2 g plant(-1), identified two additional major yield QTLs on chromosomes 1D and 5A. Many of the yield QTL clusters corresponded with QTLs already reported in wheat and, on the basis of comparative genetics, also in rice. The implications of these results for improving wheat yield stability are discussed.

AB Characterization and manipulation of aluminum (Al) tolerance genes offers a solution to Al toxicity problems in crop cultivation on acid soil, which composes approximately 40% of all arable land. By exploiting the rice (Oryza sativa L.)/rye (Secale cereale L.) syntenic relationship, the potential for map-based cloning of genes controlling Al tolerance in rye (the most Al-tolerant cereal) was explored. An attempt to clone an Al tolerance gene (Alt3) from rye was initiated by using DNA markers flanking the rye Alt3 gene, from many cereals. Two rice-derived, PCR-based markers flanking the Alt3 gene, B1 and B4, were used to screen 1,123 plants of a rye F-2 population segregating for Alt3. Fifteen recombinant plants were identified. Four additional RFLP markers developed from rice genes/putative genes, spanning 10 kb of a 160-kb rice BAC, were mapped to the Alt3 region. Two rice markers flanked the Alt3 locus at a distance of 0.05 cM, while two others cosegregated with it. The rice/rye micro-colinearity worked very well to delineate and map the Alt3 gene region in rye. A rye fragment suspected to be part of the Alt3 candidate gene was identified, but at this level, the rye/rice microsynteny relationship broke down. Because of sequence differences between rice and rye and the complexity of the rye sequence, we have been unable to clone a full-length candidate gene in rye. Further attempts to clone a full-length rye Alt3 candidate gene will necessitate the creation of a rye large-insert library.

AB Background: Earlier comparative maps between the genomes of rice ( Oryza sativa L.), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) were linkage maps based on cDNA-RFLP markers. The low number of polymorphic RFLP markers has limited the development of dense genetic maps in wheat and the number of available anchor points in comparative maps. Higher density comparative maps using PCR-based anchor markers are necessary to better estimate the conservation of colinearity among cereal genomes. The purposes of this study were to characterize the proportion of transcribed DNA sequences containing simple sequence repeats (SSR or microsatellites) by length and motif for wheat, barley and rice and to determine in-silico rice genome locations for primer sets developed for wheat and barley Expressed Sequence Tags.
   Results: The proportions of SSR types ( di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta- nucleotide repeats) and motifs varied with the length of the SSRs within and among the three species, with trinucleotide SSRs being the most frequent. Distributions of genomic microsatellites (gSSRs), EST-derived microsatellites (EST-SSRs), and transcribed regions in the contiguous sequence of rice chromosome 1 were highly correlated. More than 13,000 primer pairs were developed for use by the cereal research community as potential markers in wheat, barley and rice.
   Conclusion: Trinucleotide SSRs were the most common type in each of the species; however, the relative proportions of SSR types and motifs differed among rice, wheat, and barley. Genomic microsatellites were found to be primarily located in gene-rich regions of the rice genome. Microsatellite markers derived from the use of non-redundant EST-SSRs are an economic and efficient alternative to RFLP for comparative mapping in cereals.

AB Apicomplexan parasites invade cells by a unique mechanism involving discharge of secretory vesicles called micronemes. Microneme proteins (MICs) include transmembrane and soluble proteins expressing different adhesive domains. Although the transmembrane protein TRAP and its homologues are thought to bridge cell surface receptors and the parasite submembranous motor, little is known about the function of other MICs. We have addressed the role of MIC1 and MIC3, two soluble adhesins of Toxoplasma gondii, in invasion and virulence. Single deletion of the MIC1 gene decreased invasion in fibroblasts, whereas MIC3 deletion had no effect either alone or in the mic1KO context. Individual disruption of MIC1 or MIC3 genes slightly reduced virulence in the mouse, whereas doubly depleted parasites were severely impaired in virulence and conferred protection against subsequent challenge. Single substitution of two critical amino acids in the chitin binding-like (CBL) domain of MIC3 abolished MIC3 binding to cells and generated the attenuated virulence phenotype. Our findings identify the CBL domain of MIC3 as a key player in toxoplasmosis and reveal the synergistic role of MICs in virulence, supporting the idea that parasites have evolved multiple ligand-receptor interactions to ensure invasion of different cells types during the course of infection.

AB The isolation, physical, and genetic mapping of a group of wheat genes expressed in infected heads of Triticum aestivum 'Frontana' resistant to Fusarium head blight is reported. A cDNA library was built from heads of 'Frontana' through suppressive subtractive hybridization, to enrich for sequences induced by the pathogen Fusarium graminearum during infection. A group of 1794 clones was screened by dot blot hybridization for differential gene expression following infection. Twenty of these clones showed a strong difference in intensity of hybridization between infected and mock-inoculated wheat head samples, suggesting that they corresponded to genes induced during infection. The 20 clones were sequenced and used for mapping analysis. We determined a precise chromosomal location for 14 selected clones by using series of chromosome deletion stocks. It was shown that the 14 clones detected 90 fragments with the use of the restriction enzyme EcoRI; 52 bands were assigned to chromosome bins, whereas 38 fragments could not be assigned. The selected clones were also screened for polymorphisms on a 'Wuhan' x 'Maringa' wheat doubled haploid mapping population. One clone, Ta01subscript02b03, was related to a quantitative trait locus for type II resistance located on chromosome 2AL, as determined with simple sequence repeat markers on another mapping population, but did not map in the same location on our population. Another clone, Ta01subscript06f04, was identified by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) search in public databases to code for a novel beta-1,3-glucanase, homologous to a major pathogenesis-related protein. This clone mapped to chromosomal regions on chromosome 3, including 3BL and 3DL, where B glucanase gene clusters are known to exist. Seven other clones, including 1 coding for an ethylene-response element binding protein and 3 for ribosomal proteins, and 4 clones corresponding to proteins with unknown function, were also mapped.

AB An F-4-derived F-6 recombinant inbred line population (n = 148) of a cross between the durable stripe (yellow) rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis) and leaf (brown) rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) resistant cultivar, Triticum aestivum 'Cook', and susceptible genotype Avocet-YrA was phenotyped at several locations in Canada and Mexico under artificial epidemics of leaf or stripe rusts and genotyped using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. Durable adult plant resistance to stripe and leaf rusts in 'Cook' is inherited quantitatively and was based on the additive interaction of linked and (or) pleiotropic slow-rusting genes Lr34 and Yr18 and the temperature-sensitive stripe rust resistance gene, YrCK, with additional genetic factors. Identified QTLs accounted for 18% to 31% of the phenotypic variation in leaf and stripe rust reactions, respectively. In accordance with the high phenotypic associations between leaf and stripe rust resistance, some of the identified QTLs appeared to be linked and (or) pleiotropic for both rusts across tests. Although a QTL was identified on chromosome 7D with significant effects on both rusts at some testing locations, it was not possible to refine the location of Lr34 or Yr18 because of the scarcity of markers in this region. The temperature-sensitive stripe rust resistance response, conditioned by the YrCK gene, significantly contributed to overall resistance to both rusts, indicating that this gene also had pleiotropic effects.

AB Chromosome 5H of Hordeum vulgare 'New Golden' (NG) carries a gene(s) that accelerates heading in a wheat background. To introduce the early heading gene(s) of NG barley into the wheat genome, we attempted to induce homoeologous recombination between wheat and NG 5H chromosomes by 5B nullisomy. A nullisomic 5B, trisomic 5A, monosomic 5H plant (2n = 42) was produced from systematic crosses between aneuploid stocks of wheat group 5 chromosomes. A total of 656 F-2 plants produced by self-fertilization were screened for recombinants by a PCR assay with 3 5H-specific amplicon markers. Twelve plants (1.8%) were selected as putative wheat-barley 5H recombinants. Five of them were inviable or sterile and the remaining 7 were fertile and subjected to the progeny test. Cytological analyses using fluorescence in situ hybridization and C-banding revealed that 6 of the 7 progeny lines are true homoeologous recombinants between the long arms of chromosomes 5D and 5H, but that the other one was not a recombinant having an aberrant barley telosome. The 6 cytologically confirmed recombinant lines included only 2 types (3 lines each), which were reciprocal products derived from exchanges at the same distal interval defined by two flanking markers. One type had a small 5HL segment translocated to the 5DL terminal, and the other type had a small terminal 5DL segment translocated to the 5HL terminal. In the latter type, the physical length of translocated barley segments slightly differed among lines. Homoeologous recombinants obtained in this study should be useful for further chromosome manipulation to introgress a small interstitial 5HL chromosome segment with the early heading gene(s) to wheat. Preferential occurrence of restricted types of recombinants is discussed in relation to homoeologous relationships between wheat and barley chromosomes.

AB A wheat-Dasypyrum breviaristatum partial amphiploid and its derivatives were analyzed by molecular cytological observation and tested for disease resistance in order to evaluate the potential use of the D. breviaristatum for wheat improvement. A fertility- improved partial amphiploid, TDH-2, was produced from the selfing population of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese spring (CS)-D. breviaristatum amphiploid. Based on the results obtained from genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and seed protein electrophoresis, we found the presence of fourteen D. breviaristatum chromosomes and the absence of D genome in TDH-2, indicating that the genomic composition of TDH-2 was AABBV(b)v(b). GISH analysis on BC1F4 progenies of TDH-2 x wheat demonstrated that alien D. breviaristatum chromosomes or segments were frequently transmitted. A survey of diseases resistance revealed that powdery mildew resistance from D. breviaristatum was totally expressed, however, the expression of stripe rust resistance from D. breviaristatum was dependent on the wheat background. The comparison of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was carried out using molecular marker SCAR(1400) linked to Pm21 D. villosum-derived powdery mildew resistance gene, suggested that D. breviaristatum possessed new resistance gene(s) different from that in D. villosum. The present study showed that the partial amphiploid TDH-2 and its derivatives could serve as novel sources for transfer of disease resistance genes to wheat.

AB The gene Sm1 in common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) confers resistance to orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM) (Sitodiplosis mosellana Gehin). As previously described, resistance was inherited as a single gene ( Sm1) that expresses antibiotic properties ( death or slowed development) against larvae of OWBM. No DNA polymorphism associated with resistance was amplified following screening of about 500 Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) primers on bulked segregants but linked Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism ( AFLP) fragments were identified by screening 57 primer combinations. An allele-specific Sequence Characterized Amplified Region ( SCAR) DNA marker linked to midge resistance was elaborated from the sequence of one of these fragments. Primer sequences of this marker ( WM1; 5' to 3', forward and reverse) were CAC CTG GAA TGT TGG ACT G and ACA TCA TCT GTC AAC GCA CTA and fragment size was 232 base pairs. Genetic tests showed that WM1 was located in the subterminal region of the short arm of chromosome 2B. Sm1 was mapped to a short interval ( similar to 2.5 cM) flanked proximally by WM1 and distally by the microsatellite Xgwm210. Among resistant cultivars, 14/15 carried WM1. However among susceptible common wheats, 33/66 also carried WM1. To permit marker use in combination with marked susceptibles, a trans recombinant carrying the resistance gene Sm1 but lacking the SCAR ( WM1) was isolated in a hard red spring wheat background. In other crosses segregating for leaf rust and midge resistance, adverse linkage drag was detected due to repulsion between Lr16 and Sm1. Two cis recombinants between Lr16 and Sm1 were identified. Due to different crossover sites, these two lines show contrasting alleles of the microsatellite Xbarc35 which is also closely linked to Sm1.

AB Pyrenophora tritici-repentis causes necrosis and chlorosis in its wheat host. Si(sceptibility to races 2 (necrosis) and 5 (chlorosis) of the pathogen is known to be mediated by Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB. respectively. Sensitivity to each toxin is controlled by a single dominant and independently inherited gene. We used sensitivity to Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB as two genetic markers to investigate the origin and the state of tan spot susceptibility in Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat over a period of more than a century. Sensitivity to Ptr ToxA. the toxin produced by nearly all isolates of the pathogen collected in the past 20 years in western Canada, appears to have been present in the first major cultivar, Red Fife, grown massively in the late 1800s. Sensitivity then was transillitted unknowingly into Canadian wheat lines through extensive use of backcrossing, to maintain the Marquis-Thatcher breadmaking, quality. Sensitivity to Ptr ToxA. which nearly disappeared front cultivars grown in western Canada in the 1950s. was reintroduced in the 1960s and Unintentionally bred into many of the present-day cultivars. Sensitivity to Ptr ToxB. a toxin rarely found in isolates from western Canada. appeared with the release of Thatcher in 1934 and was transferred to many cultivars through backcross programs. In spite of large areas planted to Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB-sensitive cultivars over decades. tan spot epidemics remained sporadic until the 1970s. The results of this study raise the problem of the narrowing, genetic base of CWRS wheat lines and the potential for Unanticipated threats from plant pathogens. The intercrossing of genetically diverse material in one Canadian wheat breeding program resulted in the release of several modern cultivars with resistance to tail spot. The absence of wild-type Ptr ToxB-producing- isolates in western Canada remains unexplained. given that sensitivity to Ptr ToxB was present continuously ill western Canadian cultivars grown oil vast areas for more than 70 years.

AB Microprojectile- or Agrobacterium-mediated DNA delivery into calluses initiated from immature embryos has proven to be effective in transforming wheat. Yet, obtaining a large number of high quality immature embryos throughout the year is a laborious and delicate process. To circumvent these limitations, we propose an alternative technique applying the particle bombardment technology to calluses derived from fragmented mature embryos rather than immature tissues. The phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (bar) and beta-glucuronidase (gus) genes were used as selectable and screenable marker genes, respectively, to assess and optimise the performance of the proposed technique. Primary requirement for genetic transformation method development, the regeneration capacity of bombarded calluses was established. A preculture duration of 6 days was identified as optimal for DNA uptake and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression. The highest activity was recorded when calluses were selected. Long-term GUS expression studies (1-7 weeks subsequent to bombardment), showed differentiated behaviours for tissues obtained from mature versus immature embryos. Notably, mature embryos exhibited the greatest number of cells stably expressing the reporter gene, thus providing an excellent source material for developing a stable transformation procedure.

AB Several recent investigations of T-DNA integration sites in Arabidopsis thaliana have reported 'cold spots' of integration, especially near centromeric regions. These observations have contributed to the ongoing debate over whether T-DNA integration is random or occurs preferentially in transcriptionally active regions. When transgenic plants are identified by selecting or screening for transgenic activity, transformants with integrations into genomic regions that suppress transcription, such as heterochromatin, may not be identified. This phenomenon, which we call selection bias, may explain the perceived non-random distribution of T-DNA integration in previous studies. In order to investigate this possibility, we have characterized the sites of T-DNA integration in the genomes of transgenic plants identified by pooled polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a procedure that does not require expression of the transgene, and is therefore free of selection bias. Over 100 transgenic Arabidopsis plants were identified by PCR and compared with kanamycin-selected transformants from the same T(1) seed pool. A higher perceived transformation efficiency and a higher frequency of transgene silencing were observed in the PCR-identified lines. Together, the data suggest approximately 30% of transformation events may result in non-expressing transgenes that would preclude identification by selection. Genomic integration sites in PCR-identified lines were compared with those in existing T-DNA integration databases. In PCR-identified lines with silenced transgenes, the integration sites mapped to regions significantly underrepresented by T-DNA integrations in studies where transformants were identified by selection. The data presented here suggest that selection bias can account for at least some of the observed non-random integration of T-DNA into the Arabidopsis genome.

AB Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a widely consumed food crop and a primary protein source for many of the indigenous inhabitants of the Andean region of South America. In this study, we report the development of immature seed and floral expressed sequenced tag (EST) libraries and the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for quinoa. A total of 424 cDNA clones derived from immature seed and floral tissue were sequenced and analyzed for homology with known gene sequences. Three hundred and eleven of the clones were identified as homologues of known plant proteins, 38 were homologous to Arabidopsis proteins with no known function and 75 do not share significant homology with any protein in the queried databases. Interestingly, several of the annotated ESTs were present in relatively high abundance and have putative functions related to plant defense. Based on EST sequence information, fragments of 34 ESTs were amplified and sequenced in five quinoa accessions and one related weed species, C. berlandieri. Analysis of the quinoa EST sequences revealed a total of 51 SNPs in 20 EST sequences, including 38 single-base changes and 13 insertions-deletions (indels), with an average I SNP per 462 base pairs (bp) and 1 indel per 1812 bp. When the C. berlandieri accession was included in the analysis, 29 of the EST clones screened had at least one SNP present and an additional 81 SNPs were identified, bringing the total number of SNPs discovered to 132 (1 per 179 bp). The EST clones and SNP markers identified in this manuscript are of particular value in ongoing efforts to characterize gene expression and regulation associated with seed development, while the SNPs identified have immediate application for genetic mapping experiments, germplasm development, and the investigation of evolutionary relationships within the genus Chenopodium.

AB The genomic regions controlling caryopsis dormancy and seedling desiccation tolerance were identified using 152 F-4 lines derived from a cross between Mona, a Swedish cultivar, and an Israeli xeric wild barley Hordeum spontaneum genotype collected at Wadi Qilt, Israel. Dormancy, the inability of a viable seed to germinate, and desiccation tolerance, the ability of the desiccated seedlings to revive after rehydration, were characterized by fitting the germination and revival data with growth curves, using three parameters: minimum, maximum, and slope of germination or revival rate derived by the least square method. The genetic map was constructed with 85 genetic markers (SSRs, AFLPs, STSs, and Dhn genes) using the MULTIPOINT-mapping algorithm. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping was conducted with the MULTIQTL package. Ten genomic regions were detected that affected the target traits, seven of which affected both dormancy and desiccation tolerance traits. Both the wild barley genotype and the Swedish cultivar contributed the favorite alleles for caryopsis dormancy, whereas seedling desiccation tolerance was attributed to alleles descending from the cultivar. The results indicate that some barley dormancy genes are lost during domestication and that dormancy QTLs are associated with abiotic stress tolerance.

AB A new source of greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) resistance derived from Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal was identified in W7984, a synthetic hexaploid wheat line and one parent of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative ( ITMI) mapping population. Segregation analysis of responses to greenbug feeding in a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) identified a single, dominant gene governing the greenbug resistance in W7984, which was placed in chromosome arm 7DL by linkage analysis with molecular markers in the ITMI population. Allelism tests based on the segregation of responses to greenbug feeding in F-2 and testcross plants revealed that the greenbug resistance in W7984 and Largo, another synthetic line carrying the greenbug resistance gene Gb3, was controlled by different but linked loci. Using the ITMI reference map and a target mapping strategy, we have constructed a microsatellite map of Gb3 in a mapping population of 130 F-7 RILs from Largo x TAM 107 and identified one marker (Xwmc634) co-segregating with Gb3 and four markers (Xbarc76, Xgwm037, Xgwm428 and Xwmc824) closely linked with Gb3. Deletion mapping of selected microsatellite markers flanking the Gb3 locus placed this resistance gene into the distal 18% region of 7DL. Comparative mapping in the ITMI and Largo x TAM 107 populations using the same set of microsatellite markers provided further evidence that greenbug resistance in W7984 and Largo is conditioned by two different loci. We suggest that the greenbug resistance gene in W7984 be designated Gb7. The microsatellite map of Gb3 constructed from this study should be a valuable tool for marker-assisted selection of Gb3-conferred greenbug resistance in wheat breeding.

AB The objective of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the vernalization response in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The mapping population consisted of 184 F-2 genotypes produced from a cross between one genotype of a synthetic perennial ryegrass variety "Veyo'' and one genotype from the perennial ryegrass ecotype "Falster''. Veyo and Falster were chosen among four different populations because of their contrasting vernalization requirements. In total, five QTL for the vernalization response, measured as days to heading, were identified and mapped to linkage groups (LG) LG2, LG4, LG6 and LG7. Individually, these QTL explained between 5.4 and 28.0% of the total phenotypic variation. The overall contribution of these five QTL was 80% of the total phenotypic variation. A putative orthologue of Triticum monococcum VRN1 was amplified from genomic DNA from perennial ryegrass. PCR fragments covering the proximal part of the promoter and the 5' end of the orthologue were subsequently PCR-amplified from both parents of the mapping population and shown to possess 95% DNA sequence identity to VRN1. Several polymorphisms were identied between Veyo and Falster in this fragment of the putative VRN1 orthologue. A CAPS marker, vrn-1, was developed and found to co-segregate with a major QTL on LG4 for the vernalization response. This indicates that the CAPS marker vrn-1 could be located in an orthologous gene of the wheat VRN1.

AB Microsatellite DNA markers are consistently found to be more informative than other classes of markers in hexaploid wheat. The objectives of this research were to develop new primers flanking wheat microsatellites and to position the associated loci on the wheat genome map by genetic linkage mapping in the ITMI W7984 x Opata85 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and/or by physical mapping with cytogenetic stocks. We observed that the efficiency of marker development could be increased in wheat by creating libraries from sheared rather than enzyme-digested DNA fragments for microsatellite screening, by focusing on microsatellites with the [ATT/TAA](n) motif, and by adding an untemplated G-C clamp to the 5'-end of primers. A total of 540 microsatellite-flanking primer pairs were developed, tested, and annotated from random genomic libraries. Primer pairs and associated loci were assigned identifiers prefixed with BARC (the acronym for the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center) or Xbarc, respectively. A subset of 315 primer sets was used to map 347 loci. One hundred and twenty-five loci were localized by physical mapping alone. Of the 222 loci mapped with the ITMI population, 126 were also physically mapped. Considering all mapped loci, 126, 125, and 96 mapped to the A, B, and D genomes, respectively. Twenty-three of the new loci were positioned in gaps larger than 10 cM in the map based on pre-existing markers, and 14 mapped to the ends of chromosomes. The length of the linkage map was extended by 80.7 cM. Map positions were consistent for 111 of the 126 loci positioned by both genetic and physical mapping. The majority of the 15 discrepancies between genetic and physical mapping involved chromosome group 5.

AB The cereal cyst nematode (CCN; Heterodera avenae), a root disease of cereal crops, is a major economic constraint in many wheat (Triticum aestivum)growing areas of the world. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the Cre1, Cre8 and Cre3 genes on CCN resistance. A population of 92 doubled-haploid (DH) lines derived from a cross between wheat cvs. Frame and Silverstar as well as 1,851 wheat breeding lines were screened for CCN resistance at the Primary Industries Research Victoria (PIRVic). A second population of 9,470 wheat breeding lines was screened at the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI). Cre3 had the largest impact on reducing the number of female cysts, followed by Cre1 and Cre8. There was no significant difference in number of cysts between DH lines with or without the Cre8 marker, suggesting that the marker is not perfectly linked to Cre8. The estimated heritabilities were 0.32 in the DH population, 0.48 in the PIRVic data set and 0.32 in the SARDI data set, which confirm that this is a trait of low heritability. The repeatability of CCN resistance improved with an increase in the number of plants assessed per line-up to ten. However, 85 - 88% of the improvement was achieved with the assessments of the first five plants.

AB Using three Chinese wheat cultivars, 'Bainong 3217', 'Beijing 837' and 'Laizhou 953', as recurrent parents, 33 near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying 22 powdery mildew resistance genes (Pm1c, Pm2, Pm4b, Pm12, Pm13, Pm16, Pm20, Pm21, Pm23, and 13 undocumented genes) were developed. All NILs had no significant difference to their recurrent parents in the investigated traits of agronomic importance. The results of AFLP analysis indicated Jaccard's genetic similarity of the NILs with their recurrent parents varied from 0.96 to 0.98, and confirmed that the NILs had high genetic similarity with their recurrent parents. The resistance to powdery mildew was stably expressed by the relevant NILs. Eleven of the NILs were tested using molecular markers linked to the resistance genes Pm1c, Pm4b, Pm13, Pm21, PmP, PmE, PmPS5A, PmPS5B, PmY39, PmY150, and PmH, and they were all found to carry the targeted genes. The potential application of these NILs in gene discovery is discussed.

AB A disomic chromosome addition line of tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum L., was established previously that possesses a single chromosome pair from N. africana [Merxm. and Buttler]. This addition chromosome carries a gene that confers increased resistance to severe strains of potato virus Y (PVY). Methods to increase the probability of gene transfer from alien chromosomes to tobacco (2n= 48) are desired. In the research described here, the PVY resistance gene was transferred to a tobacco chromosome from the N. africana addition chromosome in seven independent cases. One intro-gression event was obtained using conventional back-crossing of the disomic addition line to N. tabacum cv. Petite Havana, while the remaining six events were obtained using a scheme that involved exposure of explants of the addition line to tissue culture. Twenty-six derived 2n= 48 individuals heterozygous for PVY resistance were found to exhibit 24 bivalents or 23 bivalents + 2 univalents at metaphase I. Ovular transmission rates for the PVY resistance factor ranged from 25% to 52%, while pollen transmission rates were much lower, ranging from 0 to 39%. Fifty-one random amplified. polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) markers specific. c for the intact addition chromosome were identified. ed and used to characterize derived 2n= 48/PVY-resistant genotypes. Variability was observed among these plants with respect to the total number of N. africana RAPD markers that were present, which is an indication that crossing over was occurring within each of the seven intro-gressed chromosome segments. A limited molecular marker-assisted backcrossing experiment allowed for selection of a 2n= 48/PVY-resistant individual that possessed only 6 of the 51 original N. africana RAPD markers. In vitro culture is potentially a valuable system for increasing the rate of alien gene transfer in tobacco, and the successful transfer of PVY resistance from N. africana may allow for an increased level and range of resistance to this virus in tobacco.

AB A set of tall rice landraces was characterized using 17 gene-derived simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and eight other genomic SSRs. Gene-derived SSRs (0.68) had lower polymorphism information content than the other SSRs (0.87). UPGMA analysis of gene-derived ISSRs data separated tall landraces and high-yielding varieties, which were nitrogen responsive into a major cluster and the other three landraces, which were non-responsive to nitrogen into a minor cluster at 0.37 similarity. The use of gene-derived markers that target functional loci appears to be an effective strategy in characterizing landraces for optimizing choice of parents for hybridization programmes.

AB Barley transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is routinely perforined in a number of laboratories. However, elimination of selectable marker genes and formation of plants homozygous for the transgene via conventional segregation is laborious and time-consuming. Here we suggest a concept that includes the production of primary transgenic plants via infection of immature embryos with A. followed by androgenctic generation of a segregating population of entirely homozygous plants. Selectable marker-free, true-breeding plants carrying a single-opy transgene integrant may thus be efficiently and rapidly obtained. However, amenability to Agrobacterhon-mediated transformation as well as androgenetic potential is genotype-dependent. Efficient genetic transformation by infection of immature embryos is so far confined to the spring type cultivar 'Golden Promise' which, however, turned Out to be recalcitrant in pollen embryogenesis. To facilitate androgenctic generation of homozygous se-re-ants from primary transformants, we have established a method for embryogenic pollen culture in cv. Golden Promise that includes conventional cold-treatment and subsequent preculture of immature Pollen under starvation conditions prior to transfer to complete nutrient medium. Further we show that conditioning of the pollen culture medium by co-culture of immature wheat pistils as well as addition of pistil-preconditioned medium considerably support androgenetic development . Employment of the established method using immature pollen of primary transgenic plants demonstrates that selectable marker-free, true-breeding transgenic progeny can be rapidly obtained pursuing the concept proposed. The protocol presented will be useful in functional genomics as well as in molecular breeding approaches.

AB Allelopathic effects of 10 wheat genotypes were studied in bioassays on germination and root length of lettuce. The germinating wheat seeds and seedlings of all genotypes inhibited the radicle elongation of lettuce. Excluding Secale cereale L., the inhibitory effects of wheat genotypes increased with wheat evolution history, as the genome changed from 2n to 4n to 6n. Allelopathic inhibition of different wheat genomes on lettuce radicles showed a decreasing trend of AABBDD > BB > AABB > RR > AA > DD. This suggests that the allelopathic genes may be located on genome BB and the allelopathic traits in the genomes may have evolved at different rates. The allelopathic effects of 10 spp. were correlated with age (20, 40, 60 d) of the seedlings. The allelopathic effects of different plant parts decreased in order aerial parts > whole plant > roots. A cluster analysis (Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages, UPGMA) was conducted for the allelopathic effect of 10 spp. at germination and seedling phases. In cluster analysis wheat spp. were divided into three categories based on their allelopathic effects on lettuce radicle. (a). Weak allelopathy: Triticum boeoticum L., French, Secale cereale L., Aegilops.tauschii Cosson Syn, Triticum dicoccoides K., Tritium aestivum L. Var. Shaan 160 and T aestivum Var. No.1 Ningdong. (b). Moderate allelopathy: Triticum monococcum L., Aegilops.speltoides L. and Triticum dicoccum S. and (c). Strong allelopathy: T aestivum Var. common wheat.

AB The development of new varieties of crop plants is ongoing for plant breeders and progress since the Green Revolution has been steady, if not dramatic. With the recent sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana and of rice the development of both physical and informational resources has entered a new phase. This paper examines the state of plant bioinformatics as it is now and as it is likely to develop in the future. It also looks rather further forward to what crop scientists might want from bioinformatics, before examining the likely physiological targets for sustainability traits and the prospects for their improvement in wheat. Wheat is taken as the focus crop because it is potentially one of the most difficult to work with in molecular terms, both because of its large hexaploid genome size and because of its considerable genetic distance from the most information rich plant species, Arabidopsis. Finally, we examine how these tools might be used to track down the underlying genes controlling sustainability traits and how these may then be exploited in plant breeding programmes using marker-assisted selection.

AB Selection for anthracnose disease resistance is one of the major objectives in lupin breeding programs. The aim of this study was to develop a molecular marker linked to a gene conferring anthracnose resistance in narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), which can be widely used for MAS in lupin breeding. A F-8 derived RIL population from a cross between cultivar Tanjil (resistant to anthracnose) and Unicrop (susceptible) was used for marker development. DNA fingerprinting was conducted on 12 representative plants by combining the AFLP method with primers designed based on conserved sequences of plant disease resistance genes. A co-dominant candidate marker was detected from a DNA fingerprint. The candidate marker was cloned, sequenced, and converted into a sequence-specific, simple PCR based marker. Linkage analysis based on a segregating population consisting of 184 RILs suggested that the marker, designated as AntjM2, is located 2.3 cM away from the R gene conferring anthracnose resistance in L. angustifolius. The marker has now being implemented for MAS in the Australian national lupin breeding program.

AB The dwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b were incorporated into Indian bread wheats during the "green revolution". This led to a dramatic increase in yield as well as production of wheat. Although the presence of dwarfing genes is important, their status among the released wheat varieties is generally not known. We present an analysis of the two dwarfing genes using the PCR based "perfect markers" in bread wheat (Triticum aestivrim L.) varieties, for the first time in 45 Indian, and some non-Indian wheats. Most of the varieties analyzed had either Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b or both, The results obtained for the varieties with known Rht status validated the perfect markers. Analysis of a F-2 population segregating for the dwarfing genes also confirmed the utility of these markers in genetic analysis. Analysis among some of the varieties for the GA response phenotype is also presented. The results showed that the "perfect markers" are robust enough to be used among Indian varieties.

AB Genetic engineering of cereal crops could be refined and made more publicly acceptable by the use of promoters that direct transgene expression to particular organs at defined stages of plant development. A fusion between the barley Lem1 promoter and green fluorescence protein was used to transform bread wheat. Expression analyses showed that the Lem1 promoter is active in the organs surrounding the wheat floret at anthesis. It is not active in other vegetative and seed tissues. The organ specificity and developmental regulation of the Lem1 promoter suggest that it would be useful for engineering Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.

AB Partial amphiploids are lines that contain 42 ( 38 42) wheat and 14 ( 14 - 18) alien chromosomes. They are derived by backcrossing wheat onto hybrids between wheat and either Thinopyrum intermedium (6x) or Th. ponticum (10x). GISH analysis has shown that, with possibly one exception, the alien genomes ( chromosome sets) in partial amphiploids are found to be hybrids i.e. composed of chromosomes from more than one alien genome. The individual partial amphiploids are meiotically stable and nearly perfectly fertile, but hybrids between different lines were characterized by varying numbers of unpaired chromosomes and consequently variable degrees of sterility. Translocated chromosomes involving different Thinopyrum genomes or Thinopyrum and wheat genomes were found in partial amphiploids and consequently in the addition lines derived from them. Partial amphiploids have proven to be an excellent tertiary gene pool for wheat improvement, containing resistance to biotic stresses not present in wheat itself. Resistance to Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) and Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) have been found in partial amphiploids and addition lines derived from both Th. intermedium and Th. ponticum. Excellent resistance to Fusarium head blight has been found on a Th. intermedium chromosome that had substituted for chromosome 2D in wheat. Genes for resistance to leaf rust and stem rust have already been incorporated into wheat and tagged with molecular markers. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB In a segregating homozygous F-2 population of bread wheat involving a leaf rust resistance gene Lr28 derived from Aegilops speltoides, six randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, three each in coupling and repulsion phase were identified as linked to Lr28, mapped to a region spanning 32 cM including the locus. The F-2 and F-3 populations were studied in the phytotron challenged with the most virulent pathotype 77-5 of leaf rust. A coupling phase linked RAPD marker S464(721) and a repulsion phase linked RAPD marker S326(550) flanked the gene Lr28 by a distance of 2.4 +/- 0.016 cM on either side. The flanking markers genetically worked as co-dominant markers when analyzed together after separate amplification in the F-2 population by distinguishing the homozygotes from the heterozygotes and increased the efficiency of marker assisted selection by reducing the false positives and negatives. One of the three RAPD markers, S421(640) was converted to locus specific SCAR marker SCS421(640) which was further truncated by designing primers internal from both ends of the original RAPD amplicon to eliminate a non-specific amplification of nearly same size. The truncated polymorphic sequence characterized amplified region marker (TPSCAR) SCS421(570) was 70 bp smaller, but resulted in a single band polymorphism specific to Lr28 resistance. The TPSCAR marker was validated for its specificity to the gene Lr28 in nine different genetic backgrounds and on 43 of the 50 Lr genes of both native and alien origin, suggesting the utility of the SCAR markers in pyramiding leaf rust resistance genes in wheat.

AB The Triticum dicoccoides-derived wheat line Zecoi-1 provides effective protection against powdery mildew. F-3 segregation analysis of Chinese Spring x Zecoi-1 hybrids showed that resistance in line Zecoi-1 is controlled by a single dominant gene. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of bulked segregants from F(3)s showing the homozygous resistant and susceptible phenotypes identified eight markers, of which four were associated with the resistance allele in repulsion phase. Following the assignment of these four repulsion phase AFLP markers to wheat chromosome 2B with the aid of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines, they were physically mapped in the terminal breakpoint interval 0.89 (2BL-6)-1.00 (telomere) of chromosome 2BL. Genetic and physical mapping of simple sequence repeat markers from the distal half of chromosome 2BL located the wild emmer-derived powdery mildew resistance gene distal of breakpoint 0.89 in deletion line 2BL-6. Based on disease response patterns, genomic origin and chromosomal location the resistance gene in Zecoi-1 is temporarily designated MlZec1.

AB Heterosis is an important way to improve yield and quality for many crops. Hybrid rice and hybrid maize contributed to enhanced productivity which is essential to supply enough food for the increasing world population. The success of hybrid rice in China has led to a continuous interest in hybrid wheat, even when most research on hybrid wheat has been discontinued in other countries for various reasons including low heterosis and high seed production costs. The Timopheevii cytoplasmic male sterile system is ideal for producing hybrid wheat seeds when fertility restoration lines with strong fertility restoration ability are available. To develop PCR-based molecular markers for use in marker-assisted selection of fertility restorer lines, two F-2 populations derived from crosses R18/ND36 and R9034/ND36 were used to map fertility restoration genes in the two elite fertility restorer lines (R-lines) R 18 and R9034. Over 678 SSR markers were analyzed, and markers closely linked to fertility restoration genes were identified. Using SSR markers, a major fertility restoration gene, Rf3, was located on the 1B chromosome in both populations. This gene was partially dominant in conferring fertility restoration in the two restorer lines. SSR markers Xbarc207,Xgwm131, and Xbarc61 are close to this gene. These markers maybe useful in marker-assisted selection of new restorer lines with T timopheevii cytoplasm. Two minor QTL conferring fertility restoration were also identified on chromosomes 5A (in R 18) and 7D (in R9034) in two R-lines.

AB The high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are important components of storage proteins in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Conventional techniques for identifying the HMW-GS apply SDS-PAGE. To study differentiation of the HMW glutenin genes, partial DNA sequences of the concerned alleles were characterized from eight accessions of hexaploid synthetic wheat and common wheat varieties, and compared with the available sequences. SSR markers based on, and generated from, DNA sequences of the D genome of common wheat and Aegilops tauschii were analyzed to estimate genetic relationships of the accessions. Results showed that the HMW-GS D(t)x2.1 determined by SDS-PAGE could be identified as two types at the DNA sequence level. One type, designated as D(t)x2.1a, showed identical SNPs to the D(t)x1.5 allele and another type, designated as D(t)x2.1b, had different characteristics. The SSR analysis revealed a relatively close genetic relationship of the two accessions containing the D(t)x2.1a allele to the accessions containing the D(t)x1.5 allele. It was concluded that the conventional SDS-PAGE has limitations in determining some HMW-GS, because the minor changes on the DNA sequence of a particular glutenin subunit cannot be detected at protein level, and that the AS-PCR method based on variation of DNA sequences of particular genes will provide a more powerful tool for identifying the HMW-GS. The differentiation of the genes encoding the HMW-GS is probably more rapid than expected. The close relationship between evolutionary changes of the microsatellite DNA and the HMW-GS genes detected in this study needs to be further investigated.

AB We investigated the role of cold acclimation in carrot plants with respect to its influence on the storage performance of the harvested taproots. The induction of cold acclimation was followed in plants cultivated in a growth chamber under strict climate control and in taproots harvested from two separate field cultivations where the plants had been exposed to the natural variations in climate. Under controlled growth conditions, levels of antifreeze protein (AFP) mRNA were used as a marker for cold acclimation in carrot taproot tissue. Expression of this gene was induced by cold in discs excised from harvested taproots and this induction was clearly affected by the growth temperature of the plants from which the taproots were taken. These in vitro data were consistent with those from field-grown plants. In the cell wall of taproots harvested in year 2000, where the intact plants had frequently been exposed to temperatures below 6degreesC, a 36 kDa AFP accumulated to higher levels during storage than in the taproots harvested from plants grown in year 2001, where cultivation temperatures had rarely dropped below 6degreesC. The taproots from 2001 exhibited poor storage performance as shown by an earlier increase in relative electrolyte leakage and decrease in dry matter compared to taproots harvested in 2000. The capacity of the AFP to accumulate during storage was consistent with a high storage performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits D(t)x1.5+D(t)y10 from Aegilops tauschii are a novel pair of subunits not detected previously in common wheat (Triticum aestivum). The partial DNA sequences of the x-type HMW glutenin alleles from A. tauschii and synthetic hexaploid wheat samples with different HMW glutenin subunits were charcterised. Five samples were found to contain the HMW glutenin subunit D(t)x1.5 that may affect bread-making quality. Polymorphisms of the DNA sequences were detected among alleles encoding different HMW glutenin subunits and within an allele encoding the same HMW glutenin subunit, such as the D(t)x1.5 subunit. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can distinguish the Dx(t)1.5 from D(t)x2, D(t)x5, Dx2 and Dx5 alleles were identified. Allelic specific (AS)-PCR primers were developed based the SNPs located at the non-repetitive N-terminal of the HMW glutenin subunits. The AS-PCR primers can accurately identify accessions containing the D(t)x1.5 subunit from those containing other studied subunits by PCR analysis, suggesting the usefulness of AS-PCR for identifying different HMW glutenin subunits of A. tauschii and synthetic hexaploid wheat. The AS-PCR primers developed based on SNPs in this study are valuable in wheat breeding for effective selection of special HMW glutenin subunits. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant fingerprinting and identification has increasingly become a focus in commerce and manufacturing with an emphasis on fast, reliable and cost effective high throughput techniques. GBSS1 is a well conserved single copy nuclear gene in the grass family with potential for generating a universal approach to grass fingerprinting. Alignment of DNA sequences from Poaceae members identified five well conserved regions. PCR primers designed to these regions amplified single DNA fragments on all grasses tested. DNA sequencing revealed polymorphism within these DNA fragments allowing identification at the species level. A universal sequencing primer for Poaceae enabled pyrosequencing through a 28 base pair highly polymorphic region generating unique pyrograms for rice, wheat, barley and maize. Analysis of exon/intron composition including intron length and number, of GBSS1 provided another distinct fingerprinting method for grasses. Phylogenetic utility of these fragments was demonstrated by production of phylograms consistent with previously described taxonomic relationships for the Poaceae family. The sequence polymorphism of the GBSS1 gene provides the basis for universal primer design for identification of members of the Poaceae family. The protocols developed may prove more generally useful in the distinction of plant species in other plant families. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Presence of genes in gene-rich regions on wheat chromosomes has been widely reported. However, there is a lack of information on the precise characterization of these regions with respect to the distribution of genes and recombination. We attempted to critically analyze the available data to characterize gene-rich regions and to study the distribution of genes and recombination on wheat homoeologous group 6 chromosomes which are a reservoir of several useful genes controlling traits of economic importance. Consensus physical and genetic linkage maps were constructed for homoeologous group 6 using physical and genetic mapping data. Five major gene-rich regions were identified on homoeologous group 6 chromosomes, with two on the short and three on long arm. More than 90% of marker or gene loci were present in these five gene-rich regions, which comprise about 30% of the total physical chromosomal length. The gene-rich regions were mainly present in the distal 60% regions of the chromosomes. About 61% of the total loci map in the most distal regions which span only about 4% of the physical length of the chromosome. A range of submicroscopic regions within each gene-rich region were also identified. Comparisons of the consensus physical and genetic linkage maps revealed that recombination occurred mainly in the gene-rich regions. Seventy percent of the total recombination occurred in the two most distally located regions that span only 4% of the physical length of the chromosomes. The relationship of recombination to the gene-rich region is not linear with distance from the centromere, especially on the long arm. The kb/cM estimates for group 6 chromosomes ranged from 146 kb in the gene-rich to about 10 Mb in the gene-poor region. The information obtained here is vital in understanding wheat genome structure and organization, which may lead in developing better strategies for positional cloning in wheat and related cereals.

AB Although molecular markers allow more accurate selection in early generations than conventional screens, large numbers can make selection impracticable while screening in later generations may provide little or no advantage over conventional selection techniques. Investigation of different crossing strategies and consideration of when to screen, what proportion to retain and the impacts of dominant vs. codominant marker expression revealed important choices in the design of marker-assisted selection programs that can produce large efficiency gains. Using F-2 enrichment increased the frequency of selected alleles allowing large reductions in minimum population size for recovery of target genotypes (commonly around 90%) and/or selection at a greater number of loci. Increasing homozygosity by inbreeding from F-2 to F-2:3 also reduced population size by around 90% in some crosses with smaller incremental reductions in subsequent generations. Backcrossing was found to be a useful strategy to reduce population size compared with a biparental population where one parent contributed more target alleles than the other and was complementary to F-2 enrichment and increasing homozygosity. Codominant markers removed the need for progeny testing reducing the number of individuals that had to be screened to identify a target genotype. However, although codominant markers allow target alleles to be fixed in early generations, minimum population sizes are often so large in F-2 that it is not efficient to do so at this stage. Formulae and tables for calculating genotypic frequencies and minimum population sizes are provided to allow extension to different breeding systems, numbers of target loci, and probabilities of failure. Principles outlined are applicable to implementation of markers for both quantitative trait loci (QTL) and major genes.

AB We report the use of TILLING (targeting induced local lesions in genomes), a reverse genetic, nontransgenic method, to improve a quality trait in a polyploid crop plant. Waxy starches, composed mostly of amylopectin, have unique physiochemical properties. Wheat with only one or two functional waxy genes (granule-bound starch synthase I, or GBSSI) produces starch with intermediate levels of amylopectin. We have identified 246 alleles of the waxy genes by TILLING each homoeolog in 1,920 allohexaploid and allotetraploid wheat individuals. These alleles encode waxy enzymes ranging in activity from near wild type to null, and they represent more genetic diversity than had been described in the preceding 25 years. A line of bread wheat containing homozygous mutations in two waxy homoeologs created through TILLING and a preexisting deletion of the third waxy homoeolog displays a near-null waxy phenotype. This approach to creating and identifying genetic variation shows potential as a tool for crop improvement.

AB Recent increase in the availability of expressed sequence tag (EST) data has facilitated the development of microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in a number of plant species groups, including cereals. As these SSRs are derived from ESTs/genes (EST-SSRs), they exhibit a higher potential for transfer through cross-amplification in related species than SSR markers generated from genomic DNA libraries. In this study, a sub-set of 165 EST-SSR markers from a total of 185 assigned to the genetic map of barley was examined for transferability to wheat, rye and rice. A higher proportion, i.e., 78.2% of barley markers showed amplification in wheat followed by 75.2% in rye and 42.4% in rice. Furthermore, in silico comparison of SSR-ESTs (ESTs containing SSRs) corresponding to 185 mapped barley EST-SSR loci against 1,369,182 publicly available cereal ESTs showed significant homology with ESTs of wheat (93.5%), rye (37.3%), rice (57.3%). sorghum (51.9%) and maize (51.9%). Sequence similarity of the barley ESTs with 379,944 ESTs of the two model dicot species, Arabidopsis and Medicago suggested theoretical transferability of barley markers into dicot species although at low frequency (9.7% in Arabidopsis and 8.6% in Medicago). In silico comparative mapping (sequence comparison) of mapped barley SSR-ESTs against the mapping data of rye, wheat and rice indicated the presence of orthologues of the barley SSR-ESTs in the respective species. Furthermore, nine barley EST-SSRs were experimentally mapped to a rye genetic linkage map and all could be located in the expected orthologous region compared to their position in barley.

AB Slow rusting is considered a crucial component of durable resistance to wheat leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina and is often expressed in the form of a prolonged latent period. Selection for a longer latent period is considered an effective approach to developing wheat cultivars with improved durable resistance to leaf rust. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from CI 13227 (long latent period) x Suwon 92 (short latent period) was phenotyped for latent period in two greenhouse experiments in separate years, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were analyzed in the same population. Among the RILs, the frequency distribution for latent period was continuous, and latent period was highly correlated between years (r=0.94, P<0.0001). A quantitative trait locus (QTL) prolonging the latent period of P. triticina, designated as QLrlp.osu-2DS, explained 42.8% and 54.5% of the phenotypic and genetic variance in the two experiments, respectively. QLrlp.osu-2DS was mapped on the distal region of chromosome 2DS. Two other QTLs for latent period, QLrlp.osu-2B and QLrlp.osu-7BL, were localized on chromosome 2B and the long arm of chromosome 7B, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that these three QTLs collectively explained 58.0% and 73.8% of the phenotypic and genetic variance over two experiments, respectively. Fourteen RILs that carried all three alleles for long latent period at three AFLP loci flanking QLrlp.osu-2DS, QLrlp.osu-2B, and QLrlp.osu-7BL had a mean latent period of 12.5 days, whereas 13 RILs without any long-latent-period alleles at the corresponding loci had a mean latent period of 7.4 days. Three SSR markers closely linked to these QTLs have potential to be applied in marker-assisted selection for prolonged latent period in wheat.

AB Soil-borne barley yellow mosaic virus disease caused by a complex of at least three viruses, i.e. Barley mild mosaic virus ( BaMMV), Barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) and BaYMV- 2 - is one of the most important diseases of winter barley in Europe. The two genes rym4, effective against BaMMV and BaYMV, and rym5, additionally effective against BaYMV- 2, comprise a complex locus on chromosome 3HL, which is of special importance to European barley breeding. To provide the genetic basis for positional cloning of the Rym4/Rym5 locus, two high-resolution maps were constructed based on co-dominant flanking markers (MWG838/Y57c10 - MWG010/ Bmac29). Mapping at a resolution of about 0.05% rec., rym4 has been located 1.07% recombination distal of marker MWG838 and 1.21% recombination proximal to marker MWG010. Based on a population size of 3,884 F-2 plants (0.013% recombination) the interval harbouring rym5 was delimited to 1.49 +/- 0.14% recombination. By testing segmental recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for reaction to the different viruses at a resolution of 0.05% rec. (rym4) and 0.019% rec. (rym5), no segregation concerning the reaction to the different viruses could be observed. AFLP-based marker saturation for rym4, using 932 PstI+2/MseI+3 primer combinations only resulted in three markers with the closest one linked at 0.9% recombination to the gene. Two of these markers detected epialleles arising from the differential cytosine methylation of PstI sites. Regarding rym5, pro. ling of 1,200 RAPD primers ( about 18,000 loci) and 2,048 EcoRI+3/MseI+3 AFLP primer combinations ( about 205,000 loci) resulted in one RAPD marker and seven AFLP markers tightly linked to the resistance gene. Flanking markers with the closest linkage to rym5 ( 0.05% and 0.88% recombination) were converted into STS markers. These markers provide a starting point for chromosomal walking and may be exploited in marker-assisted selection for virus resistance based on rym5.

AB Genetic control of herbage quality variation was assessed through the use of the molecular marker-based reference genetic map of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and genomic DNA-derived simple sequence repeat-based (SSR) framework marker set was enhanced, with RFLP loci corresponding to genes for key enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis and fructan metabolism. Quality traits such as crude protein (CP) content, estimated in vivo dry matter digestibility (IVVDMD), neutral detergent fibre content (NDF), estimated metabolisable energy (EstME) and water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content were measured by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis of herbage harvests. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using single-marker regression, simple interval mapping and composite interval mapping approaches, detecting a total of 42 QTLs from six different sampling experiments varying by developmental stage (anthesis or vegetative growth), location or year. Coincident QTLs were detected on linkage groups (LGs) 3, 5 and 7. The region on LG3 was associated with variation for all measured traits across various experimental datasets. The region on LG7 was associated with variation for all traits except CP, and is located in the vicinity of the lignin biosynthesis gene loci xlpomt1 (caffeic acid-O-methyltransferase), xlpccr1 (cinnamoyl CoA-reductase) and xlpssrcad 2.1 (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase). Comparative genomics analysis of these gene classes with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) provides evidence for conservation of gene order over evolutionary time and the basis for cross-specific genetic information transfer. The identification of co-location between QTLs and functionally associated genetic markers is critical for the implementation of marker-assisted selection programs and for linkage disequilibrium studies, which will enable future improvement strategies for perennial ryegrass.

AB Little is known about factors that affect the indigenous populations of rhizobia in soils. We compared the abundance, diversity and genetic structure of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae populations in soils under different crop managements, i.e., wheat and maize monocultures, crop rotation, and permanent grassland. Rhizobial populations were sampled from nodules of pea- or vetch plants grown in soils collected at three geographically distant sites in France, each site comprising a plot under long-term maize monoculture. Molecular characterization of isolates was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer as a neutral marker of the genomic background, and PCR-restriction fragment length 0polymorphism of a nodulation gene region, nodD, as a marker of the symbiotic function. The diversity, estimated by richness in types and Simpson's index, was consistently and remarkably lower in soils under maize monoculture than under the other soil managements at the three sites, except for the permanent grassland. The highest level of diversity was found under wheat monoculure. Nucleotide sequences of the main rDNA intergenic spacer types were determined and sequence analysis showed that the prevalent genotypes in the three maize fields were closely related. These results suggest that long-term maize monoculturing decreased the diversity of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae populations and favored a specific subgroup of genotypes, but the size of these populations was generally preserved. We also observed a shift in the distribution of the symbiotic genotypes within the populations under maize monoculture, but the diversity of the symbiotic genotypes was less affected than that of IGS types. The possible effect of such changes on biological nitrogen fixation remains unknown and this requires further investigation.

DEVELOPMENT OF A SORGHUM CORE COLLECTION: REFINEMENT AND EVALUATION OF A SUBSET FROM SUDAN. Economic Botany 58(4):556-567, 2004. The U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) maintains over 40 000 sorghum accessions, which is too large to adequately screen at one time. The objectives of this research were to establish an initial core collection and use clustering techniques to refine one sub-set of that core. Because much of the total sorghum collection lacks complete descriptor or other usable data, the collection was broken out into its respective country of origin and random selection of 10% of the accessions from each country was used to develop the core. Based on these criteria, a core collection of 3011 accessions representing 77 different countries was developed A more complete phenotypic dataset representing the Sudan allowed for the development of a refined subset of the core collection from this country. The core from Sudan is made up of 352 accessions that represent 13.8% of the total Sudan collection. This core was then evaluated for imbibitional high temperature sensitivity, leaf high temperature sensitivity, and acquired thermotolerance. The results show that these assay systems evaluate distinct aspects of the sorghums' metabolism and that each assay provides unique information about the relative heat tolerance of the sorghum. The impact of the sorghum core collection at this time is unknown. Theoretically, the core should provide a road map from which scientists can map genetic diversity of sorghum and further enhance the capabilities to isolate and clone genes of importance in the future.

GENETIC DIVERSITY OF DARNEL (LOLIUM TEMULENTUM L.) IN MALO, ETHIOPIA DEPENDS ON TRADITIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS. Economic Botany 58(4):568-577, 2004. Darnel (Lolium temulentum L.) is a mimic weed associated with wheat and barley cultivation. Mimic weeds have evolved along with cultivated crops. Human impact on the genetic diversity of agricultural weeds was elucidated using darnel as a model. Three strains in each field in Gaitza village, Malo region, Ethiopia were randomly sampled, and the genetic composition of 120 samples was analyzed using RAPD analysis. Genetic diversity and distances were calculated using Nei's analysis, and cluster analysis was performed. These results indicated the occurrence of seed migration among the fields and a high genetic diversity of darnel in this region. Crop seed exchange and contamination of crop seeds with darnel seeds lead to the unintended artifical gene flow of darnel. Because darnel seeds and seedlings resemble their associated crop seeds and seedlings, traditional methods of crop cultivation have the unintended consequence of conserving the genetic diversity of darnel.

AB The genetic diversity of spelt (Triticum aestivum (L.) Thell. subsp. spelta (L.) Thell.) cultivated presently is very narrow. Although the germplasm collections of spelt are extensive, the related genetic knowledge is often lacking and makes their use for genetic improvement difficult. The genetic diversity and structure of the spelt gene pool held in gene banks was determined using 19 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers applied to 170 spelt accessions collected from 27 countries and 4 continents. The genetic distances (1-proportion of shared alleles) were calculated and an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA)-based dendrogram was generated. The genetic diversity was high: 259 alleles were found and the mean interaccession genetic distance was 0.782 +/- 0.141. The dendrogram demonstrated the much higher genetic diversity of spelt held in germplasm collections than in the currently used genotypes. Accessions with the same geographical origin often tended to cluster together. Those from the Middle East were isolated first. All but one of the Spanish accessions were found in a unique subcluster. Most accessions from eastern Europe clustered together, while those from northwestern Europe were divided into two subclusters. The accessions from Africa and North America were not separated from the European ones. This analysis demonstrates the extent of genetic diversity of spelts held in germplasm collections and should help to widen the genetic basis of cultivated spelt in future breeding programs.

AB The alien addition line TAI-27 contains a pair of chromosomes of Thinopyrum intermedium that carry resistance against barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). A subtractive library was constructed using the leaves of TAI-27, which were infected by Schizaphis graminum carrying the GAV strain of BYDV and the control at the three-leaf stage. Nine differentially expressed genes were identified from 100 randomly picked clones and sequenced. Two of the nine clones were highly homologous with known genes. Of the remaining seven cDNA clones, five clones matched with known expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences from wheat and (or) barley whereas the other two clones were unknown. Five of the nine differentially expressed sequences (WTJ9, WTJ11, WTJ15, WTJ19, and WTJ32) were highly homologous (identities >94%) with ESTs from wheat or barley challenged with pathogens. These five sequences and another one (WTJ18) were also highly homologous (identities >86%) with abiotic stress induced ESTs in wheat or barley. Reverse Northern hybridization showed that seven of the nine differentially expressed cDNA sequences hybridized with cDNA of T. intermedium infected by BYDV. Three of these also hybridized with eDNA of line 3B-2 (a parent of TAI-27) infected by BYDV. The alien chromosome in TAI-27 was microdissected. The second round linker adaptor mediated PCR products of the alien chromosomal DNA were labeled with digoxygenin and used as the probe to hybridize with the nine differentially expressed genes. The analysis showed that seven differentially expressed genes were homologous with the alien chromosome of TAI-27. These seven differentially expressed sequences could be used as ESTs of the alien chromosome of TAI-27. This research laid the foundation for screening and cloning of new specific functional genes conferring resistance to BYDV and probably other pathogens.

AB Spike morphology is a key characteristic in the study of barley domestication, yield, and use. Multiple alleles at the vrs1 locus control the development and fertility of the lateral spikelets of barley. We developed five amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers tightly linked to the vrs1 locus using well-characterized nearisogenic lines as plant materials. The AFLP markers were integrated into three different maps, in which `Azumamugi' was used as the maternal parent. Of the three maps, Hordeum vulgare L. `Azumamugi' x H. vulgare 'Golden Promise' showed recombination of the AFLP markers and the vrs1 locus (closest, 0.05 cM), providing the best mapping population for positional cloning of alleles at the vrs1 locus. Conversion of AFLP bands into polymorphic sequence-tagged sites (STSs) is necessary for further high-throughput genotype scoring and for bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library screening. We cloned and sequenced the five AFLP bands and synthesized primer pairs. PCR amplification generated DNAs of the same size from all four parental lines for each marker. Restriction endonuclease treatment of e40m36-1110/ACCIII, e34m13-260/Psp1406I, e52m32-270/FokI, and e31m26-520/MnlI revealed fragment length polymorphisms between `Azumamugi' and all the two-rowed parents. Allelism between the AFLPs and corresponding STS markers was confirmed genetically, indicating the usefulness of the STSs as genetic markers.

AB A set of differential isolates of Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici was used to identify 10 alleles at the Pm3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 1A. Three F-3 populations were used to map Pm3h in Abessi, Pm3i in line N324, and Pm3j alleles in GUS 122 relative to microsatellite markers. In total, 13 marker loci were mapped on chromosome 1AS and 1 marker on 1AL. The order of marker loci in the 3 mapping populations is consistent with previously published maps. All 3 alleles were mapped in the distal region of chromosome 1AS. The present study indicated that microsatellite markers are an ideal marker system for comparative mapping of alleles at the same gene locus in different mapping populations. The linkage distances of the closest microsatellite marker, Xgwm905-1A, to Pm3h, Pm3i, and Pm3j were 3.7 cM, 7.2 cM, and 1.2 cM, respectively. The microsatellite marker Xgwm905-1A cannot be used to distinguish between Pm3 alleles. The development of specific markers for individual Pm3 alleles is discussed on the basis of the recently cloned Pm3b allele.

AB Phosphoribulokinase (PRKase, EC 2.7.1.19) plays an important role in regulating the flow of sugar through the Calvin cycle. To investigate its regulatory character and expression pattern, the gene encoding PRKase in rice was cloned by RACE. A full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 1212 bp encoding 403 amino acids residues was obtained from an indica rice variety, 9311. The OsPrk is a single locus gene in the rice genome. It is localized in the region of 28.32 similar to 28.33 Mb on the Chromosome 2, flanked by the genetic markers RM450 and MRG0168. RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsPrk gene was expressed in all the tissues we tested and OsPrk transcript level could be dramatically boosted by light illumination. Its expression was down-regulated by externally applied NaCl, ABA, MeJA and glucose over 24 hr, whereas it was up-regulated by GA after 24 hr treatments. These results also indicated that OsPrk gene expression is modulated by these factors at multiple levels.

AB Yield and quality reductions caused by Fusarium head blight (FHB) have spurred spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeders to identify and develop new sources of host plant resistance. Four wheat synthetic hexaploids (x Aegilotriticum sp.) were developed, each having a quantitative trait locus (QTL), Qfhs.ndsu-3AS, providing FHB resistance from Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides chromosome 3A. Synthetics were produced by hybridizing a 'Langdon' T. dicoccoides-recombinant chromosome 3A substitution line (2n = 4x - 28, AABB) with two accessions of T. tauschii (2n - 2x = 14, DD). Synthetics were inoculated and evaluated for FHB resistance in two separate greenhouse seasons. One synthetic, 01NDSWG-5, exhibited FHB severity ratings of 36% and 32% in the separate seasons, compared with ratings of 9% and 30% for 'Alsen', a FHB-resistant spring cultivar, and ratings of 70% and 96% for 'McNeal', a susceptible spring cultivar, respectively. Synthetic x Alsen backcross-derived lines were produced to initiate combining different sources of FHB resistance.

AB Earliness, an adaptative trait and factor of variation for agronomic characters, is a major trait in plant breeding. Its constituent traits, photoperiod sensitivity (PS), vernalization requirement (VR) and intrinsic earliness (IE), are largely under independent genetic controls. Mapping of major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling these components is in progress. Most of the studies focusing on earliness considered it as a whole or through one ( or two) of its components. The purpose of this study was to detect and map QTL for the three traits together through an experimental design combining field trials and controlled growth conditions. QTL were mapped in a population of F-7 recombinant inbred lines derived by single-seed descent from a cross between two French varieties, 'Renan' and 'Recital'. A map was previously constructed, based on 194 lines and 254 markers, covering about 77% of the genome. Globally, 13 QTL with a LOD> 2.5 were detected, of which four control PS, five control VR and four control IE. Two major photoperiod sensitive QTL, together explaining more than 31% of the phenotypic variation, were mapped on chromosomes 2B and 2D, at the same position as the two major genes Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1. One major VR QTL explaining ( depending on the year) 21.8 - 39.6% of the phenotypic variation was mapped on 5A. Among the other QTL, two QTL of PS and VR not referenced so far were detected on 5A and 6D, respectively. A VR QTL already detected on 2B in a connected population was confirmed.

AB A population comprising 102 doubled haploid lines were produced from a cross between Beka, a barley cultivar widely grown in Spain, and Logan, a north American cultivar with inherently low protein content, a character considered to derive from the cultivar Karl. The intentions were to determine whether low-nitrogen malting barleys could be developed in Spain, and if genetic factors that influenced protein content were similarly expressed in widely diverse environments, i.e. northeastern Spain and eastern Scotland. An extensive map comprising 187 molecular markers was developed. Expressed sequence-tagged-derived markers were used in addition to anonymous simple sequence repeats to determine the potential for identifying candidate genes for quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and 22 such markers were mapped for the first time. There was transgressive segregation for both yield and protein content, and the gene for low protein from Logan was not expressed in the Scottish environment. In 2002, high yield was associated with earlier heading date in Spain, while late heading at the Scottish site was associated with greater lodging and lower thousand-kernel weight. These appeared to be possible pleiotropic effects of a factor detected on chromosome 2H. Using information from a consensus map, it was shown that this locus on 2H was in the region of the photoperiod response gene Eam6. A QTL explaining 18% of the variation in grain protein content was detected on chromosome 5H in a region in which a gene for nitrate reductase was previously observed. No effect on grain protein was associated with chromosome 6H, which has been suggested as the location of the low protein gene from Karl. However, it is likely that Karl contained more than one genetic factor reducing protein, and we postulate that the gene on 6H may have been lost during the breeding of Logan.

AB Three dominant resistance genes, Pr3, Pr4, and Pr5, were identified by genetic analysis of resistance to leaf rust in rye (Puccinia recondita f. sp. secalis). Each of the three genes confers resistance to a broad scale of single-pustule isolates (SPIs), but differences could be observed for specific Pr gene/SPI combinations. Resistance conferred by the three genes was effective in both detached-leaf tests carried out on seedlings and in field tests of adult plants. Molecular marker analysis mapped Pr3 to the centromeric region of rye chromosome arm 1RS, whereas Pr4 and Pr5 were assigned to the centromeric region of 1RL. Chromosomal localization and reaction patterns to specific SPIs provide evidence that the three Pr genes represent distinct and novel leaf-rust resistance genes in rye. The contributions of these genes to resistance breeding in rye and wheat are discussed.

AB Background and Aims Landrace populations represent an important intra-crop reservoir of biodiversity and source of novel gene alleles for use in breeding programmes. Here the aim was to measure the diversity of a wheat landrace, 'Barbela', from the north of Portugal.
   Methods DNA was extracted from 59 accessions of Barbela collected across its geographical range. Diversity was measured by microsatellite length polymorphisms using 27 primer pairs amplifying 34 polymorphic microsatellite loci.
   Key Results High levels of polymorphism were found, with an average polymorphism information content of 0.52; an average of 4.77 alleles (range 2-11) were present at each locus, and half of these loci showed an additional allele in the reference variety 'Chinese Spring'.
   Conclusions 'Barbela' is maintained from seeds collected by farmers, but it maintains high allelic variation, and no groupings of accessions were detected when analysed by geographical region, farm or climate, indicating that the wheat landrace is a homogeneous entity. The diversity within the farmer-maintained landrace demonstrates the importance of characterization and maintenance of landrace collections before valuable genetic combinations are lost as uniform commercial crops are introduced.

AB Aphelinus albipodus Hayat and Fatima is a potential biological control agent of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, which is a newly introduced soybean pest in the United States. We compared the reproductive compatibility and molecular genetic variation between two geographic strains of A. albipodus. One strain was collected from soybean aphids in Japan and the other recovered from Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), in the western U.S., populations of which were established with parasitoids imported from Eurasia. We present results of crossing experiments between the two strains, genetic differences based on RAPD-PCR markers, rDNA ITS1 and ITS2 gene sequences, and presence of Wolbachia in the two strains using PCR amplification of the wsp gene. We found no reduction in the production of females in reciprocal crosses between strains, but a significant reduction in fecundity when F, females stemming from one of the reciprocal crosses were backcrossed to males from either source. The two strains differed by 3.4% in the rDNA ITS1 sequence and by presence/absence of one RAPD-PCR marker from a total of 20 RAPD primers screened, but their rDNA ITS2 sequences were identical. We used restriction enzyme analysis to separate the strains bit differential digestion of the ITS I PCR product. Wolbachia was present in 100% of males and females of both strains of A. albipodus.

AB Yellow mosaic virus, YMV, causes one of the most severe of biotic stresses in Vignas, an important group of pulse crops. The viral disease is transmitted through the white fly, Bemicia tabaci, and the yield of the plants is affected drastically. YMV-tolerant lines, generated from a single YMV-tolerant plant identified in the field within a large population of the susceptible cultivar T-9, were crossed with T-9, and F-1, F-2 and F-3 progenies raised. The different generations were phenotyped for YMV-reaction by forced inoculation using viruliferous white flies. A monogenic recessive control of YMV-tolerance was revealed from the F-2 segregation ratio of 3:1 (susceptible: tolerant), which was confirmed by the segregation ratio of the F-3 families. Of 24 pairs of resistance gene analog (RGA) primers screened, only one pair, RGA 1F-CG/RGA 1R, was found to be polymorphic among the parents. Selected F, individuals and F, families were genotyped with the polymorphic RGA primer pair and the polymorphism was found to be linked with YMV-reaction. This primer pair amplified a 445bp DNA fragment only from homozygous tolerant and the heterozygous lines. The 445bp marker band was sequenced and named 'VMYR1'. The predicted amino acid sequence showed highly significant homology with the NB-ARC domain present in several gene products involved in plant disease resistance, nematode cell death and human apoptotic signaling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of YMV-resistance linked DNA marker development in any crop species using segregating populations. This YMV-resistance linked marker is of potential commercial importance in resistance breeding of plants.

AB Genetic relationships among common wheat varieties from the 10 wheat growing regions of China were assessed using SSR markers. The wheat varieties included 33 modem varieties and 63 landraces selected from the national gene bank collection of China. One hundred and four pairs of selected primers detected a total of 802 alleles, of which 234 were specific to A genome, 309 to B genome, and 221 to D genome. The average genetic richness per locus (SigmaA(ij)/loci) for A, B and D genomes were 6.88, 7.92 and 7.62, respectively. Their average genetic dispersion indices (H-t) were 0.637, 0.694 and 0.656, respectively. The B genome showed the highest genetic diversity among the three wheat genomes. The landraces had a higher genetic diversity than the modem varieties, and the major difference between the landraces and the modem varieties in China existed in the D genome, followed by B and A genomes. The majority of the accessions (65.6%) had heterogeneity at the 112 loci detected. The highest heterogeneity locus percentages were 9.09 and 12.73 in the modem varieties and the landraces, respectively. SSR data were analyzed with NTSYS-pc software. The genetic similarities between accessions were estimated with the DICE coefficient. The accessions clustered into two groups, the modem varieties and the landraces by the un-weighted pair-group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA). The trend of correlation coefficients between genetic similarity matrices based on different numbers of random alleles and that of 802 alleles showed that 550 alleles were sufficient to construct a robust dendrogram. The separated simulations from six sub-samples revealed that 550 alleles were the minimum number required to confidently determine the genetic relationships. It was shown that the number of alleles (loci) needed do not have a strong association with the number of wheat lines in the sample size. These data suggested that 73 loci with good polymorphism are needed to reflect genetic relationships among accessions with more than 90% certainty. In the dendrogram, most accessions from the same wheat region were clustered together, and those from geographically adjacent regions usually appeared in the same small group. This indicated that genetic diversity of Chinese common wheat has a close association with their geographic distribution and ecological environment.

AB Breeding wheat for resistance is the most effective means to control Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici). At least eight genes that confer resistance to STB in wheat have been identified. Among them, the Stb4 locus from the wheat cv. Tadinia showed resistance to M. graminicola at both seedling and adult-plant stages. However, no attempt has been made to map the Stb4 locus in the wheat genome. A mapping population of 77 F-10 recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) derived from a three-way cross between the resistant cv. Tadinia and the susceptible parent (Yecora Rojo x UC554) was evaluated for disease resistance and molecular mapping. The RILs were tested with Argentina isolate 1 89 of M. graminicola for one greenhouse season in Brazil during 1999, with an isolate from Brazil (1PBrl) for one field season in Piracicaba (Brazil) during 2000, and with Indiana tester isolate IN95-Lafayette-1196-WW-1-4 in the greenhouse during 2000 and 2001. The ratio of resistant:susceptible RILs was 1: 1 in all three tests, confirming the single-gene model for control of resistance to STB in Tadinia. However, the patterns of resistance and susceptibility were different between the Indiana isolate and those from South America. For example, the ratio of RILs resistant to both the Indiana and Argentina isolates, resistant to one but susceptible to the other, and susceptible to both isolates was approximately 1: 1: 1: 1, indicating that Tadinia may contain at least two genes for resistance to STB. A similar pattern was observed between the Indiana and Brazil isolates. The gene identified with the Indiana tester isolate was assumed to be the same as Stb4, whereas that revealed by the South American isolates may be new. Bulked-segegant analysis was used to identify amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers linked to the presumed Stb4 gene. The AFLP marker EcoRI-ACTG/MseI-CAAA5 and microsatellite Xgwmlll were closely linked to the Stb4 locus in coupling at distances of 2.1 and 0.7 centimorgans (cM), respectively. A flanking marker, AFLP EAGG/M-CATIO, was 4 cM from Stb4. The Stb4 gene was in a potential supercluster of resistance genes near the centromere on the short arm of wheat chromosome 7D that also contained Stb5 plus five previously identified genes for resistance to Russian wheat aphid. The microsatellite marker Xgwnilll identified in this study may be useful for facilitating the transfer of Stb4 into improved cultivars of wheat.

AB The analysis of the hexaploid wheat genome (Triticum aestivum L., 2n=6x=42) is hampered by its large size (16,974 Mb/1C) and presence of three homoeologous genomes (A, B and D). One of the possible strategies is a targeted approach based on subgenomic libraries of large DNA inserts. In this work, we purified by flow cytometry a total of 10(7) of three wheat D-genome chromosomes: 1D, 4D and 6D. Chromosomal DNA was partially digested with HindIII and used to prepare a specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. The library (designated as TA-subD) consists of 87,168 clones, with an average insert size of 85 kb. Among these clones, 53% had inserts larger than 100 kb, only 29% of inserts being shorter than 75 kb. The coverage was estimated to be 3.4-fold, giving a 96.5% probability of identifying a clone corresponding to any sequence on the three chromosomes. Specificity for chromosomes 1D, 4D and 6D was confirmed after screening the library pools with single-locus microsatellite markers. The screening indicated that the library was not biased and gave an estimated coverage of sixfold. This is the second report on BAC library construction from flow-sorted plant chromosomes, which confirms that dissecting of the complex wheat genome and preparation of subgenomic BAC libraries is possible. Their availability should facilitate the analysis of wheat genome structure and evolution, development of cytogenetic maps, construction of local physical maps and map-based cloning of agronomically important genes.

AB Over the past 10 years, resources have been established for the genetic analysis of pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., an important staple crop of the semi-arid regions of India and Africa. Among these resources are detailed genetic maps containing both homologous and heterologous restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genetic maps produced in four different crosses have been integrated to develop a consensus map of 353 RFLP and 65 SSR markers. Some 85% of the markers are clustered and occupy less than a third of the total map length. This phenomenon is independent of the cross. Our data suggest that extreme localization of recombination toward the chromosome ends, resulting in gaps on the genetic map of 30 cM or more in the distal regions, is typical for pearl millet. The unequal distribution of recombination has consequences for the transfer of genes controlling important agronomic traits from donor to elite pearl millet germplasm. The paper also describes the generation of 44 SSR markers from a (CA)(n)-enriched small-insert genomic library. Previously, pearl millet SSRs had been generated from BAC clones, and the relative merits of both methodologies are discussed.

AB Scab disease caused by Fusarium spp. has been a major concern for both wheat producers and consumers. Deployment of scab-resistant varieties is the major strategy to curb this disease. To identify the scab resistance genes in wheat cv. Wangshuibai, we produced a F-6:7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population by crossing Wangshuibai with the scab-susceptible cultivar Nanda2419. The RILs were evaluated for scab resistance in the field by single floret inoculation in two replicates in 2002 and one replicate in 2003. The number of diseased spikelets (NDS) and the length of diseased rachides (LDR) were investigated to reflect the Type II resistance. Among 654 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers surveyed, 326 were found to be polymorphic between the parents. A partial molecular map was constructed with these markers that covered over 2,210 cM of the wheat genome. Six chromosome regions showed association with both NDS and LDR in a one-way ANOVA analysis, even though the variation explained by them varied between the two traits. Eight intervals were detected for their association with Type II resistance through interval mapping, five of which were not identified in single-point analysis. The quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects were the ones in the interval of Xgwm533-3-Xgwm533-1 on chromosome 3B and in the interval of Xwmc539-Xbarc024 on chromosome 6B, whose alleles favoring resistance originate from Wangshuibai. In addition, a QTL whose resistance allele originated from Nanda2419 was consistently detected in the interval of Xs1021m-Xgwm47-1 on chromosome 2B. These results suggest that Wangshuibai is the major source for Type II resistance in this population. The markers associated with these QTL would facilitate the use of scab-resistant genes of Wangshuibai in scab resistance breeding programs of wheat.

AB Increased expression of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) Bx7 is associated with improved dough strength of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour. Several cultivars and landraces of widely different genetic backgrounds from around the world have now been found to contain this so-called 'over-expressing' allelic form of the Bx7 subunit encoded by Glu-B1al. Using three methods of identification, SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC and PCR marker analysis, as well as pedigree information, we have traced the distribution and source of this allele from a Uruguayan landrace, Americano 44D, in the mid-nineteenth century. Results are supported by knowledge of the movement of wheat lines with migrants. All cultivars possessing the Glu-B1al allele can be identified by the following attributes: (1) the elution of the By sub-unit peak before the Dx sub-unit peak by RP-HPLC, (2) high expression levels of Bx7 (>39% Mol% Bx), (3) a 43 bp insertion in the matrix-attachment region (MAR) upstream of the gene promoter relative to Bx7 and an 18 bp nucleotide duplication in the coding region of the gene. Evidence is presented indicating that these 18 and 43 bp sequence insertions are not causal for the high expression levels of Bx7 as they were also found to be present in a small number of hexaploid species, including Chinese Spring, and species expressing Glu-B1ak and Glu-B1a alleles. In addition, these sequence inserts were found in different isolates of the tetraploid wheat, T. turgidum, indicating that these insertion/deletion events occurred prior to hexaploidization.

AB In a mapping population derived from the Ethiopian barley line L94 x Vada, natural infection by barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) occurred. While line L94 hardly showed symptoms, Vada was severely affected. The 103 recombinant inbred lines segregated bimodally. The major gene responsible for this resistance mapped to chromosome 6H. We propose to name the locus Ryd3. A subset of recombinant inbred lines, L94, and Vada were planted in a subsequent field test which confirmed the previous field observations. Double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (DAS-ELISA) indicated that the epidemic was due to a combination of the serotypes BYDV-PAV and BYDV-MAV. In the accessions with the least BYDV symptoms no virus was detected, justifying the consideration of the gene as conferring true resistance rather than tolerance to these viruses. In a laboratory/gauze house trial a near-isogenic line carrying the Vada chromosome 6H fragment in an L94 background was affected as much as Vada. The effect of Ryd3 was quantified, and compared with that of the only other known major gene for resistance to BYDV, Ryd2, which is also of Ethiopian origin and is located on chromosome 3H. Both genes seemed to reduce the chance of the viral isolate used in this study to establish infection. In plants in which it became established, the virus concentration reached a similar level as in susceptible accessions, but with less dramatic symptom development. Inoculated plants in which the virus failed to multiply tended to show an increase in the number of ears per plant, resulting in higher grain yield per plant. Ryd3 co-segregates with several PCR-based molecular markers that may serve for marker assisted selection.

ID HEAD BLIGHT RESISTANCE; ADULT-PLANT RESISTANCE; POPULATIONS; VALIDATION;

AB The stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided durable broad-spectrum, adult-plant resistance to the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici throughout wheat-growing regions of the world for more than 50 years. The ability to select for Sr2 in wheat breeding programs was recently improved by the identification of a tightly linked microsatellite marker gwm533. This marker typically amplifies a 120-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment from wheat lines carrying Sr2. In instances where the 120-bp fragment is not associated with the presence of Sr2, DNA sequence analysis has shown that a second allele was amplified, differing in the structure of the microsatellite repeat. To discriminate this allelic homoplasy (alleles identical in size, but not identical by descent), sequence-tagged microsatellites (STM) markers were developed for the Xgwm533 locus. These markers were shown to be diagnostic for the presence of Sr2 in a wide range of germplasm, representative of all major wheat varieties historically grown in Australia. The STMs will be particularly useful for marker-assisted selection in Southern Australian breeding programs, where the use of the marker gwm533 is often precluded by the presence of the non-Sr2-associated 120-bp allele in the pedigree of current breeding germplasm. The STMs also revealed a high incidence of previously undetected allelic homoplasy at the Xgwm533 locus and may have broader utility in genetic research and breeding, as this locus is also reported to be strongly associated with a major gene conferring resistance to Fusarium head blight.

AB The state of the art in Fusarium head blight resistance research is reviewed with reference to breeding for genetic resistance to Fusarium in wheat in practice. Fusarium graminearum and F culmorum produce the trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). DON has phytotoxic properties and is an important aggressiveness factor in head blight. Head blight resistance in wheat is not specific for either F graminearum or F culmorum. Resistance components include resistance to penetration, resistance to colonization and mechanisms that influence kernel DON content. The resistance to Fusarium in wheat is a quantitative trait with relative high heritability and controlled by a few genes with major effect. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for head blight resistance from the Chinese variety Sumai 3 has been identified and verified by several research groups via molecular marker analysis. Research is now directed at identifying additional QTLs to make accumulation of resistance genes in elite wheat lines possible. The policy of official variety list trials may affect the head blight resistant level of future wheat varieties by excluding candidate varieties that are a too susceptible to Fusarium. A higher level of Fusarium head blight will guarantee lower risks for the farmer of crop loss due to reduced grain yield, low quality and mycotoxin contamination. (C) 2004 ILSI.

AB The genetic diversity, structure, and relationships of 12 populations of blind subterranean mole rats belonging to four species of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies were examined. Diversity levels and divergence of 19 nuclear microsatellite markers were analysed. Results indicate that the 12 populations fall into two major clusters representing the species pairs Spalax galili (2n = 52) and S. golani (2n = 54) vs. S. carmeli (2n = 58) and S. judaei (2n = 60). There is very little gene flow between the species pairs, except for one population (Afiq) of S. carmeli (2n = 58), which is located near the hybrid zone between S. golani (2n = 54) and S. carmeli (2n = 58). Higher values of the mean for alleles per locus, gene diversity, and number of unique alleles were observed for the southern species pair, S. carmeli and S. judaei, than for the northern species pair, S. galili and S. golani. Microsatellite diversity increases southward toward the Negev Desert and is positively correlated with aridity stress. Climatic factors of water availability coupled with temperature account for 76.7% of microsatellite variance. Natural selection appears to adaptively determine microsatellite evolution in Spalax regionally across Israel. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The complex hexaploid wheat genome offers many challenges for genomics research. Expressed sequence tags facilitate the analysis of gene-coding regions and provide a rich source of molecular markers for mapping and comparison with model organisms. The objectives of this study were to construct a high-density EST chromosome bin map of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes to determine the distribution of ESTs, construct a consensus map of group 2 ESTs, investigate synteny, examine patterns of duplication, and assess the colinearity with rice of ESTs assigned to the group 2 consensus bin map. A total of 2600 loci generated from 1110 ESTs were mapped to group 2 chromosomes by Southern hybridization onto wheat aneuploid chromosome and deletion stocks. A consensus map was constructed of 552 ESTs mapping to more than one group 2 chromosome. Regions of high gene density in distal bins and low gene density in proximal bins were found. Two interstitial gene-rich islands flanked by relatively gene-poor regions on both the short and long arms and having good synteny with rice were discovered. The map locations of two ESTs indicated the possible presence of a small pericentric inversion on chromosome 2B. Wheat chromosome group 2 was shown to share synteneous blocks with rice chromosomes 4 and 7.

AB The focus of this study was to analyze the content, distribution, and comparative genome relationships of 996 chromosome bin-mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) accounting for 2266 restriction fragments (loci) on the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Of these loci, 634, 884, and 748 were mapped on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D, respectively. The individual chromosome bin maps revealed bins with a high density of mapped ESTs in the distal region and bins of low density in the proximal region of the chromosome arms, with the exception of 3DS and 3DL. These distributions were more localized on the higher-resolution group 3 consensus map with intermediate regions of high-mapped-EST density on both chromosome arms. Gene ontology (GO) classification of mapped ESTs was not significantly different for homoeologous group 3 chromosomes compared to the other groups. A combined analysis of the individual bin maps using 537 of the mapped ESTs revealed rearrangements between the group 3 chromosomes. Approximately 232 (44%) of the consensus mapped ESTs matched sequences on rice chromosome 1 and revealed large- and small-scale differences in gene order. Of the group 3 mapped EST unigenes similar to21 and 32% matched the Arabidopsis coding regions and proteins, respectively, but no chromosome-level gene order conservation was detected.

AB The objectives of this study were to develop a high-density chromosome bin map of homoeologous group 7 in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), to identify gene distribution in these chromosomes, and to per-form comparative studies of wheat with rice and barley. We mapped 2148 loci from 919 EST clones onto group 7 chromosomes of wheat. In the majority of cases the numbers of loci were significantly lower in the centromeric regions and tended to increase in the distal regions. The level of duplicated loci in this group was 24% with most of these loci being localized toward the distal regions. One hundred nineteen EST probes that hybridized to three fragments and mapped to the three group 7 chromosomes were designated landmark probes and were used to construct a consensus homoeologous group 7 map. An additional 49 probes that mapped to 7AS, 7DS, and the ancestral translocated segment involving 7BS also were designated landmarks. Landmark probe orders and comparative maps of wheat, rice, and barley were produced on the basis of corresponding rice BAC/PAC and genetic markers that mapped on chromosomes 6 and 8 of rice. Identification of landmark ESTs and development of consensus maps may provide a framework of conserved coding regions predating the evolution of wheat genomes.

AB This study examined the genetic structure of a Saskatchewan population of Mycosphaerella graminicola, cause of the foliar disease Septoria tritici blotch of wheat. Such knowledge is valuable for understanding the evolutionary potential of this pathogen and for developing control strategies based on host resistance. Nine pairs of single-locus microsatellite primers were used to analyze the genomic DNA of 90 isolates of M. graminicola that were collected using a hierarchical sampling procedure from different locations, leaves, and lesions within a wheat field near Saskatoon. Allelic series at eight different loci were detected. The number of alleles per locus ranged from one to five with an average of three alleles per locus. Genetic diversity values ranged from 0.04 to 0.67. Partitioning the total genetic variability into within- and among-location components revealed that 88% of the genetic variability occurred within locations, i.e., within areas of 1 m(2), but relatively little variability occurred among locations. Low variability among locations and a high degree of variability within locations would result if the primary source of inoculum was airborne ascospores, which would be dispersed uniformly within the field. This finding was confirmed by gametic disequilibrium analysis and suggests that the sexual reproduction of M. graminicola occurs in Saskatchewan.

AB Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are a valuable source of molecular markers. To enhance the resolution of an existing linkage map and to identify putative functional polymorphic gene loci in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), over 260 000 ESTs from 5 different grass species were analyzed and 5418 SSR-containing sequences were identified. Using sequence similarity analysis, 156 cross-species superclusters and 138 singletons were used to develop primer pairs, which were then tested on the genomic DNA of barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat. Three-hundred sixty-eight primer pairs produced PCR amplicons from at least one species and 227 primer pairs amplified DNA from two or more species. EST-SSR sequences containing dinucleotide motifs were significantly more polymorphic (74%) than those containing trinucleotides (56%), and polymorphism was similar for markers in both coding and 5' untranslated (UTR) regions. Out of 112 EST-SSR markers, 90 identified 149 loci that were integrated into a reference wheat genetic map. These loci were distributed on 19 of the 21 wheat chromosomes and were clustered in the distal chromosomal regions. Multiple-loci were detected by 39% of the primer pairs. Of the 90 mapped ESTs, putative functions for 22 were identified using BLASTX queries. In addition, 80 EST-SSR markers (104 loci) were located to chromosomes using nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. The enhanced map from this study provides a basis for comparative mapping using orthologous and PCR-based markers and for identification of expressed genes possibly affecting important traits in wheat.

AB Self incompatibility (SI) in Phalaris coerulescens is gametophytically determined by two unlinked multi allelic loci (S and Z). Neither the S nor Z genes have yet been cloned. As part of a map-based cloning strategy, high-resolution maps of the S and Z regions were generated from distorted segregating populations using RFLP probes from wheat, barley, oat, and Phalaris. The S locus was delimited to 0.26 cM with two boundary markers (Xwg811 and Xpsr168) and cosegregated with Xbm2 and Xbcd762. Xbcd266 was the closest marker linked to Z (0.9 cM). A high level of colinearity in the S and Z regions was found in both self-incompatible and -compatible species. The S locus was localized to the subcentromere region of chromosome 1 and the Z locus to the long arm end of chromosome 2. Several rice BAC clones orthologous to the S and Z locus regions were identified. This opens the possibility of using the rice genome sequence data to generate more closely linked markers and identify SI candidate genes. These results add further support to the conservation of gene order in the S and Z regions of the grass genomes.

AB Frost tolerance is an important trait for barley breeding. Field selection for this trait is not always efficient since, especially in Southern Europe, severe winter frost occurs erratically. Recent advances of cloned genes and molecular markers in barley provide molecular breeders with the means to develop new, simple PCR-based molecular markers, which can be used to select frost-tolerant genotypes quickly without stress simulation. This paper reports the development of two STS markers derived from the RFLP probes WG644 and PSR637, chosen as they are located on the long arm of homoeologous group 5 chromosomes of Triticeae, known to harbour the most important loci for frost tolerance. The two STS markers were validated together with one selected RAPD marker, OPA17, by separating two sets of winter and spring barley genotypes with different levels of frost tolerance. The ability of the developed markers to select segregant frost-tolerant and frost-susceptible genotypes was then investigated in a population of doubled haploid lines derived from a cross between a highly tolerant ('Nure') and a susceptible ('Tremois') genotype. In this population only two markers, OPA17 and Psr637 demonstrated their efficiency in dividing the phenotypes according to the parental alleles. These two markers mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5H, tightly linked to two frost tolerance QTLs. Two polymorphic bands of the WG644 STS were mapped: the former on the long arm of chromosome 5H (Wg644c) and the latter (Wg644b) on the long arm of chromosome 2H.

AB The tissue-specificity of the sugarcane bacilliform virus (SCBV) promoter was investigated in oat, barley, and wheat to determine whether its expression pattern in one species was predictive of promoter specificity in the other closely related Gramineae species. Progeny of transgenic plants produced using constructs containing the SCBV promoter driving gusA were sampled at different stages of plant development and stained for GUS activity using a histochemical assay. Overall, the GUS staining patterns were most similar between oat and barley. In all three species, similar GUS staining patterns were observed in mature endosperms, leaves, and floral bracts of developing infloresences. No GUS staining was detected in oat embryos whereas the entire barley embryo was stained, and GUS staining was confined to the scutellum of wheat embryos. Oat and barley stems exhibited GUS staining whereas no GUS staining was observed in stems of the transgenic wheat plants. The SCBV promoter conferred strong GUS staining intensity in most tissues of oat and barley but was generally weaker in wheat. These differences in SCBV promoter specificity indicate that promoter evaluation should be conducted in the target species of interest rather than by extrapolation from expression patterns in other species.

AB To increase the numbers of microsatellites available for use in constructing a genetic map, and facilitate the use of functional genomics to elucidate fiber development and breeding in cotton, we sampled microsatellite sequences from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) transcribed during fiber elongation in the A-genome species Gossypium arboreum to evaluate their frequency of occurrence, level of polymorphism and distribution in the At and Dt subgenomes of tetraploid cotton. From among ESTs derived from G. arboreum fibers at 7-10 days post anthesis (dpa), 931 ESTs were found to contain simple sequence repeats (SSRs); 544 (58.4%) EST-SSR primer pairs were developed, and 468 (86%) amplified PCR products from allotetraploid cotton (G. hirsutum cv. TM-1 and G. barbadense cv. Hai7124). However, only 99 (18.2%) of these were found to be polymorphic and segregating in our interspecific BC1 mapping population [(TM-1xHai7124)xTM-1]. In these amplified and informative EST-SSRs, hexa- and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most frequent, representing 40.1 and 30%, respectively, of the total. A total of 111 loci detected with these 99 EST-SSRs were integrated into our backbone map including 511 SSR loci. The distribution of the EST-SSRs appeared to be non-random, since 72 loci were anchored to the At and 37 to the Dt subgenome of allotetraploid cotton based on linkage tests. Interestingly, out of the 10 pairs of duplicate loci amplified, seven were mapped to the corresponding homeologous linkage groups and/or chromosomes. BLASTX analysis revealed that 69 of the 99 ESTs showed significant similarities to known genes. Some genes important for fiber development, such as sucrose synthase, were mapped to corresponding chromosomes. These EST-SSRs provide structural and functional genomic information that will be useful for understanding cotton fiber development.

AB Although quantitative trait loci (QTL) underpin many desirable agronomic traits, their incorporation into crop plants through marker-assisted selection is limited by the low predictive value of markers on phenotypic performance. Here we used candidate defense response (DR) genes to dissect quantitative resistance in rice using recombinant inbred (RI) and advanced backcross (BC) populations derived from a blast-resistant cultivar, Sanhuangzhan 2 (SHZ-2). Based on DNA profiles of DR genes, RI lines were clustered into two groups corresponding to level of resistance. Five DR genes, encoding putative oxalate oxidase, dehydrin, PR-1, chitinase, and 14-3-3 protein, accounted for 30.0, 23.0, 15.8, 6.7, and 5.5% of diseased leaf area (DLA) variation, respectively. Together, they accounted for 60.3% of the DLA variation and co-localized with resistance QTL identified by interval mapping. Average phenotypic contributions of oxalate oxidase, dehydrin, PR-1, chitinase, and 14-3-3 protein in BC lines were 26.1, 19.0, 18.0, 11.5, and 10.6%, respectively, across environments. Advanced BC lines with four to five effective DR genes showed enhanced resistance under high disease pressure in field tests. Our results demonstrate that the use of natural variation in a few candidate genes can solve a long-standing problem in rice production and has the potential to address other problems involving complex traits.

AB A major leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) (QLrP.sfr-7DS) previously has been described on chromosome 7DS in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Forno. It was detected in a population of single-seed descent (SSD) lines derived from the cross Arina x Forno. QLrP.sfr-7DS conferred a durable and slow-rusting resistance phenotype, co-segregated with a QTL for leaf tip necrosis (LTN) and was mapped close to Xgwm295 at a very similar location as the adult plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 found in some spring wheat lines. Here, we describe the validation of this QTL by mapping it to the same chromosomal region close to Xgwm295 on chromosome 7DS in a population of SSD lines from the winter wheat x spelt (T. spelta) cross Forno x Oberkulmer. In both populations, the log of the likelihood ratio curves for leaf rust resistance and LTN peaked at identical or very similar locations, indicating that both traits are due to the same gene. We have improved the genetic map in the target region of QLrP.sfr-7DS using microsatellite and expressed sequence tag (EST) markers. Two EST loci (Xsfr.BF473324 and Xsfr.BE493812) define a genetic interval of 7.6 centimorgans containing QLrP.sfr-7DS, a considerably more precise genetic location for this QTL than previously described both in spring and winter wheat. The identified genetic interval is physically located in the distal 39% of chromosome 7DS. Single-marker analysis identified Xsfr.BF473324 and Xgwm1220 as the most informative loci for QLrP.sfr-7DS and QLtn.sfr-7DS. In the rice genome, the two ESTs flanking the QLrP.sfr-7DS/QLtn.sfr-7DS chromosomal segment in wheat are conserved on chromosome 6S in a region colinear with wheat chromosome 7DS. There, they define a physical region of three rice bacterial artificial chromosomes spanning approximate to300 kb.

AB Stripe rust of wheat caused by Puccinia striiformis West. f. sp. tritici presents a serious problem for wheat production worldwide, and identification and deployment of resistance sources to it are key objectives for many wheat breeders. Here we report the detection of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers linked to the durable adult plant resistance of cv. 'Otane', which has conferred this resistance since its release in New Zealand in 1984. A double haploid population from a cross between 'Otane' and the susceptible cv. 'Tiritea' was visually assessed for adult plant infection types (IT) in the glasshouse and field, and for final disease severity in the field against stripe rust pathotype 106E139A(+). At least three resistance loci controlled adult plant resistance to stripe rust in this population. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping results revealed that two of these, one on chromosome 7DS corresponds to the durable adult plant resistance gene Yr18 and other on chromosome 5DL were contributed from 'Otane'; while the remaining one on chromosome 7BL, was contributed from the susceptible 'Tiritea'. Interval mapping placed the 'Otane'-resistant segment near the centromere of chromosome 7DS at a distance of 7 cM from the SSR marker gwm44. The stability of QTL in the two environments is discussed. SSR gwm44 is potentially a candidate marker for identifying the durable resistance gene Yr18 in breeding programmes.

AB A sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker tagged to an Agropyron elongatum-derived leaf rust resistance (Lr) gene Lr19 was validated on 18 known alien Lr genes in near-isogenic lines (NILs) in the variety 'Thatcher', along with three wheat cultivars carrying Lr24 and two carrying Lr19. The marker was expressed only in the Lr24 lines confirming that the marker tagged the gene Lr24. The monomorphic expression of the SCAR marker in 10 NIL pairs for Lr19 and Lr24 revealed that each NIL pair possessed the same gene, Lr24. The donor parents used in the NIL pairs for Lr19 ('Sunstar*6/C80-1') and Lr24 ('TR380-14*7/3Ag#14') amplified the same fragment. Non-segregation for leaf rust in the F-2 population of the cross between the above donor parents confirmed the presence of the same gene in the two parents. Apparently, a genuine parent stock of 'Sunstar*6/C80-1' was not involved in the development of the NIL pairs for Lr19 due to an improper maintenance breeding protocol either at source or destination which went undetected in the absence of signs of virulence for either gene in the region.

AB The study was aimed at the identification of random amplified polymorphic DNA markers linked to genes controlling male sterility in rye with the C-source of sterility-inducing cytoplasm. Markers of male sterility were distinguished using bulk segregant analysis, carried out on the two F-2 crosses between male sterile and male fertile inbred lines. Screening of polymorphisms revealed by 1000 arbitrary 10-mer primers allowed the detection of 10 markers in the cross between 711-cmsC and DS2 lines and seven markers in the cross between 544-cmsC and Ot0-20 lines. Five markers were common for the two crosses, which allowed comparative mapping to be performed. Ten markers were mapped on the 4RL chromosome arm where two linked quantitative trait loci (QTL) for male sterility were discovered. Additional QTL of minor effect on male fertility were detected between the two linked markers provisionally assigned to the 6RS chromosome arm. The effectiveness of the marker-assisted selection (MAS) for male-sterile genotypes was evaluated.

AB A dwarf mutant 'NDF-1', approximately 70 cm high, was derived from a 200-cm high doubled haploid (DH) line '3529' (Brassica napus), seeds of which were jointly treated with chemical inducers and bombardment of fast neutron. The leaves of the 'NDF-1' mutant were wrinkled and thicker compared with the wild-type control. The mutant had much lower values than its original parents for all agronomic traits, except for its seed weight. A genetic analysis revealed that dwarfism is under the control of a major gene (designated as ndf1) with a mainly additive effect and non-significant dominance effect. Because of the high level of resistance to lodging, breeding programmes for double low dwarf oilseed rape and heterosis utilization were initiated. Some new dwarf strains with improved agronomic performance were developed. The hybrid of the cross between the tall parent and the dwarf line showed increased harvest index and significantly higher seed yield than the tall parent or the control variety 'Zhongyou 821' and presented an estimated heterosis vigour rate as high as 12.5-25.8%. The dwarf trait will be a promising marker for a simple, economic and efficient way to control the purity of F-1 hybrid varieties in hybrid production of B. napus.

AB Endopeptidase allele Ep-D1c and DNA marker-assisted selection have been used for the incorporation of Lr19 + Lr24 leaf rust resistance genes combination into adapted commercial winter wheat cultivars. The first step was the transfer of the gene Lr19 from the donor cultivar Agrus into acceptor cultivars Simona and Livia. The progenies possessing the null allele Ep-D1c linked to the gene Lr19 have been screened for their resistance to leaf rust by isolate 4332 SaBa. The plants homozygous properties at the Ep-D1c locus and resistant against leaf rust were used for crossing with NIL Thatcher/Lr24 - a donor of the gene Lr24. Plants possessing both Lr genes were selected from F-2 population by STS and isozyme markers linked to the Lr genes. Progenies of 18 F-2 plants have been selected by STS marker and tested for resistance against leaf rust. Results obtained with isozyme and STS markers corresponded with resistance testing.

AB A family of Golgi-localised molecules was recently described in animals and fungi possessing extensive coiled regions and a short (similar to40 residues) conserved C-terminal domain, called the GRIP domain, which is responsible for their location to this organelle. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified a gene (AtGRIP) encoding a putative GRIP protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal domain from AtGRIP functions as a Golgi-targeting sequence in plant cells. Localisation studies in living cells expressing the AtGRIP fused to a DsRed2 fluorescent probe, showed extensive co-location with the Golgi marker alpha-mannosidase I in transformed tobacco protoplasts. GRIP-like sequences were also found in genomic databases of rice, maize, wheat and alfalfa, suggesting that this domain may be a useful Golgi marker for immunolocalisation studies. Despite low sequence identity amongst GRIP domains, the plant GRIP sequence was able to target to the Golgi of mammalian cells. Taken together, these data indicate that GRIP domain proteins might be implicated in a targeting mechanism that is conserved amongst eukaryotes.

AB A microsatellite consensus map was constructed by joining four independent genetic maps of bread wheat. Three of the maps were F-1-derived, doubled- haploid line populations and the fourth population was 'Synthetic' x 'Opata', an F-6-derived, recombinant-inbred line population. Microsatellite markers from different research groups including the Wheat Microsatellite Consortium, GWM, GDM, CFA, CFD, and BARC were used in the mapping. A sufficient number of common loci between genetic maps, ranging from 52 to 232 loci, were mapped on different populations to facilitate joining the maps. Four genetic maps were developed using MapMaker V3.0 and JoinMap V3.0. The software CMap, a comparative map viewer, was used to align the four maps and identify potential errors based on consensus. JoinMap V3.0 was used to calculate marker order and recombination distances based on the consensus of the four maps. A total of 1,235 microsatellite loci were mapped, covering 2,569 cM, giving an average interval distance of 2.2 cM. This consensus map represents the highest-density public microsatellite map of wheat and is accompanied by an allele database showing the parent allele sizes for every marker mapped. This enables users to predict allele sizes in new breeding populations and develop molecular breeding and genomics strategies.

AB The potential for non-reciprocal Robertsonian translocations of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) to assist in the stacking of genes was assessed from a study of their cytological and genetic behaviour. To obtain translocations, a double monosomic (3B+5A; 2n=40=19ii+2i) was crossed reciprocally with a contrasting disomic. Individuals inheriting a broken monosome were identified from the loss of one arm-specific DNA marker coupled with retention of a marker for the opposite arm. No double breaks ( potential translocations) were found in 180 cross progeny recovered from pollen of the double monosomic but two instances ( loss of 5AL plus 3BS; loss of 5AL plus 3BL) were found in 251 progeny recovered from ovules. Meiotic pairing and multi-color genome-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (mcGISH) showed that each plant with a double break contained one translocated chromosome between the A and B genomes that had rejoined at the centromere and that formed a trivalent (19ii + 1iii) in about 83% of PMC. Most trivalents ( approximately 92%) aligned at metaphase in a 'V' configuration ( alternate disjunction) while the rest aligned in linear 'I' ( adjacent disjunction) or ambiguous 'L' configurations. Genetic analysis of a testcross of these 'fusion monosomics' showed that this preferential co-orientation of the trivalent influenced the assortment of the chromosome arms involved. Loci that were located in the hemizygous ends of the 'V' trivalent showed strong quasi-linkage in that most ovules from the female testcross carried relevant DNA markers either from both standard chromosomes or from neither. This shows that, in most cases, the two standard chromosomes assorted to the same pole while the fused monosome segregated to the opposite pole. For heterozygous loci ( present both on the fusion monosome and the standard chromosomes) assortment was either independent or showed partial linkage to the hemizygous arm depending on the reported recombination distance from centromere. Marker assortment was further distorted in male testcrosses and in doubled haploids ( made from the fusion monosomics by the maize method) by the strong selective advantage of pollen or haploids that inherited the standard chromosomes rather than the deficiencies. This genetic data shows that under the combined influence of alternate disjunction and natural selection, progeny of fusion monosomics will revert to the standard disomic arrangement, fixing the gene content of both hemizygous arms in the process. Thus, any pair of genes could be targeted for joint fixation by isolating the fusion monosome that will link them temporarily in a segregating population.

SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
LA English
DT Article
ID HEXAPLOID WHEAT; D-GENOME
AB Aegilops tauschii ( goat grass) is the progenitor of the D genome in hexaploid bread wheat. We have screened more than 200 Ae. tauschii accessions for resistance against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) isolates, which are avirulent on the leaf rust resistance gene Lr1. Approximately 3.5% of the Ae. tauschii accessions displayed the same low infection type as the tester line Thatcher Lr1. The accession Tr. t. 213, which showed resistance after artificial infection with Lr1 isolates both in Mexico and in Switzerland, was chosen for further analysis. Genetic analysis showed that the resistance in this accession is controlled by a single dominant gene, which mapped at the same chromosomal position as Lr1 in wheat. It was delimited in a 1.3-cM region between the restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP) markers ABC718 and PSR567 on chromosome 5DL of Ae. tauschii. The gene was more tightly linked to PSR567 (0.47 cM) than to ABC718 (0.79 cM). These results indicate that the resistance gene in Ae. tauschii accession Tr. t. 213 is an ortholog of the leaf rust resistance gene Lr1 of bread wheat, suggesting that Lr1 originally evolved in diploid goat grass and was introgressed into the wheat D genome during or after domestication of hexaploid wheat. Compared to hexaploid wheat, higher marker polymorphism and recombination frequencies were observed in the region of the Lr1 ortholog in Ae. tauschii. The identification of Lr1Ae, the orthologous gene of wheat Lr1, in Ae. tauschii will allow map-based cloning of Lr1 from this genetically simpler, diploid genome.

AB Numerous barley cultivars from around the world have been identified as potential sources of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance genes. All of these cultivars exhibit partial resistance, and several mapping studies have shown that resistance to FHB is controlled by multiple genes. Successful development of barley cultivars with high levels of FHB resistance will require combining genes from multiple sources. We characterized five potential new sources of FHB resistance ('AC Oxbow', 'Atahualpa', 'HOR211', 'PFC88209', and 'Zhedar# 1') to determine if they contain new FHB resistance genes. Cluster analysis, using a set of 80 SSR markers distributed throughout the genome, showed that most of the new sources of resistance were not similar to three cultivars that have been used in previous FHB mapping studies ('Chevron', 'Frederickson', and 'Gobernadora'), with 'Atahualpa' and 'HOR211' being the most dissimilar. By selective genotyping, we determined whether markers linked to six known FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs), discovered in other genotypes, explained variation for resistance in advanced breeding populations created from the new sources of resistance. Markers linked to four of the six known QTLs were associated with FHB severity in at least one of the populations. However, none of the six QTL regions were associated with variation for FHB severity in populations derived from crosses that utilized sources of resistance HOR211 or PFC88209. Selective genotyping is an efficient method for breeders to utilize current QTL information about disease resistance to search for new resistance genes.

AB The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rhodani), is one of the major insect pests of wheat worldwide and it is important to develop a basic understanding of the chromosomal locations of known and new greenbug resistance genes. Gby is a new greenbug resistance gene in the wheat line 'Sando's selection 4040'. A mapping population used in this study was derived from a cross of Sando's 4040 and PI220127, a greenbug susceptible wheat land race from Afghanistan. A progeny test indicated that Gby is inherited as a single semi-dominant gene. A genetic linkage map consisting of Gby, Xgwm322 (a wheat microsatellite marker), XksuD2 (an STS marker) and 18 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci was constructed. We used DNA from Chinese Spring 7A deletion lines to show that the gwm332 and ksuD2 amplified fragments mapped in this study are located on a long arm of chromosome 7A. This suggests that Gby is located on wheat chromosome 7A. Gby was mapped to the area in the middle of the 'island' of putative defense response genes that are represented by RFLP markers (Xpsr119, XZnfp, Xbcd98 and Pr1b) previously mapped to the distal part of the short arm of wheat chromosome group 7. This region of chromosome 7A is characterized by a high recombination rate and a high physical density of markers which makes Gby a very good candidate for map-based cloning. The selection accuracy when the RFLP markers Xbcd98, Xpsr119 or XZnfp and Pr1b flanking Gby are used together to tag Gby is 99.78%, suggesting that they can be successfully used in marker assisted selection.

In the study reported here, we isolated several molecular markers closely linked to Rpp1 via bulked segregant analysis, with the gene being tagged in an interval of 5 cM between the two most adjacent markers. It was possible to convert the most closely linked amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) marker into a sequence-characterised amplified region (SCAR) segregating in the same manner. Indirect mapping of Rpp1 in relation to the black spot resistance gene Rdr1 revealed no linkage between the two R genes. Furthermore, the genetic model based on a single dominant resistance gene was supported by the marker data.

AB Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n=6x=42) is an allohexaploid composed of three closely related genomes, designated A, B, and D. Genetic analysis in wheat is complicated, as most genes are present in triplicated sets located in the same chromosomal regions of homoeologous chromosomes. The goal of this report was to use genomic information gathered from wheat-rice sequence comparison to develop genome-specific primer sets for five genes involved in starch biosynthesis. Intron locations in wheat were inferred through the alignment of wheat cDNA sequences with rice genomic sequence. Exon-anchored primers, which amplify across introns, allowed the sequencing of introns from the three genomes for each gene. Sequence variation within introns among the three wheat genomes provided the basis for genome-specific primer design. For three genes, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Agp-L), sucrose transporter (SUT), and waxy (Wx), genome-specific primer sets were developed for all three genomes. Genome-specific primers were developed for two of the three genomes for Agp-S and starch synthase I (SsI). Thus, 13 of 15 possible genome-specific primer sets were developed using this strategy. Seven genome-specific primer combinations were used to amplify alleles in hexaploid wheat lines for sequence comparison. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in a comparison of 5,093 bp among a minimum of ten wheat accessions. Two of these SNPs could be converted into cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) markers. Our results indicated that the design of genome-specific primer sets using intron-based sequence differences has a high probability of success, while the identification of polymorphism among alleles within a genome may be a challenge.

AB The capacity to tiller is a key factor that determines plant architecture. Using molecular markers, a single major gene reducing tiller number, formally named the tiller inhibition gene (tin), was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1A in wheat. We identified a tightly linked microsatellite marker (Xgwm136) that may be useful in future marker-assisted selection. The tin gene was mapped to the distal deletion bin of chromosome 1AS (FLM value 0.86) and wheat ESTs which were previously mapped to the same deletion bin were used to identify 18 closely related sequences in the syntenic region of rice chromosome 5. For a subset of wheat ESTs that detected flanking markers for tin, we identified closely related sequences within the most distal 300 kb of rice chromosome 5S. The synteny between the distal chromosome ends of wheat 1AS and rice 5S appeared to be disrupted at the hairy glume locus and seed storage protein loci. We compared map position of tin with other reduced tillering mutants characterised in other cereals to identify possible orthologous genes.

Of the seven 12S haplotypes only three (haplotypes 1, 2, and 3) occurred in populations from North America, indicating these were most likely the introduced haplotypes. Haplotypes were not restricted to any given biotype of M. destructor as defined by virulence to resistance genes in wheat. Thus, neutral markers did not show structure based on biotype. Populations of M. destructor showed a predominance of one haplotype over the others in specific geographic regions. However, Wolbachia DNA was not detected in any population, indicating that inheritance patterns of mtDNA in M. destructor were most likely due to repeated bottlenecks leading to the expansion of one lineage over another. The complete complement of 12S sequences in the M. destructor populations was subjected to a phylogenetic reconstruction by using haplotypes 1 and 3 of the gall midge Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason), as outgroups. Results from this initial study indicate a more robust phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis of population history will test the hypothesis of a single introduction of M. destructor into North America.

AB Angular leaf spot (ALS), caused by the fungus Phaeoisariopsis griseola (Sacc.) Ferr., is one of the most important diseases of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in tropical and subtropical bean producing areas. The common bean accession G 10474 has been widely resistant to P. griseola, including pathotype 63-63, one of the most virulent P. griseola pathotypes characterized. The objectives of this study were to determine the inheritance of angular leaf spot resistance and to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene in G 10474. Resistance to P. griseola pathotypes 63-63 in G 10474 was investigated in F-2 populations derived from a cross between G 10474 and Sprite (universally susceptible). Inoculation of parents, F-1, F-2, and backcross-derived plants with race 63-63 revealed that a single dominant gene conditioned ALS resistance in G 10474. A combination of the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique and bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was applied to the F-2 population to identify molecular markers linked to the ALS resistance gene in G 10474. Three AFLP markers (E-ACAIM-CIT330, E-AAC/M-CAG(310), and E-AAC/M-CAT(285)) segregated in coupling phase with the resistance gene in G 10474. The E-ACAIM-CTT330 marker was successfully converted to a codominant sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker at 5 cM from the resistance gene. Validation of the SCAR marker outside the mapping population showed that the utility of this marker for marker-assisted selection (MAS) was limited to the Andean gene pool of P. vulgaris. Therefore, the SCAR marker we report can only be used to introgress the ALS resistance of G 10474 into Andean backgrounds.

AB Growth habit varies among accessions of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The winter habit genotype (homozygous recessive for vrn-A1, vrn-B1, vrn-D1) requires a cold treatment to induce flowering and is generally planted in the fall. Spring habit genotypes flower in the absence of a vernalization treatment. Spring habit is conferred by a dominant allele at any of the three VRN-1 loci, but varieties carrying the VRN-A1 locus are the most frequent and usually flower earlier. To facilitate selection in populations segregating at the VRN-A1 locus and to assist in genotyping wheat accessions of unknown VRN-1 composition, a PCR-based marker for growth habit would be useful. The VRN-A1 gene was recently cloned allowing for the development of markers for growth habit. In this report, we designed primer sets specific for the VRN-A1 locus, and used them to amplify an 810-bp segment of the VRN-A1 gene between intron 4 and exon 8 from 40 spring wheat lines and 37 winter wheat lines. Three diagnostic nucleotide changes were identified that differentiated the dominant Vm-A1 and recessive vrn-A1 alleles in 75 out of the 77 genotypes analyzed in this study. One of these differences resulted in the presence of an additional AciI restriction site in the allele for spring growth habit. This difference was exploited to develop a cleavage amplification polymorphic sequence (CAPS) that can be used to determine the allelic state at VRN-A1 in germplasm collections, and as a marker in backcross breeding projects. An additional pair of dominant markers was developed from a different polymorphism.

AB Timing of transcript accumulation for genes involved in a variety of cellular processes was assessed by RT-PCR in endosperm from developing wheat grains grown under moderate (24/17 degreesC day/night) and high (37/28 degreesC day/night) temperature regimens. Under moderate temperatures, transcripts for proteins with storage functions were present at all five time points examined between 7 and 34 DPA, while transcripts for proteins involved in signal transduction, protein synthesis and metabolism were most abundant from 7 to 20 DPA. Transcripts for proteins that play roles in defense were present from 14 DPA, about the time that starch accumulation commenced, to 34 DPA. High temperatures advanced and compressed the timing of transcript accumulation during grain development. Comparisons of transcript profiles with the timing of key events in grain development identified genes whose transcripts were accumulated at equivalent stages under the two temperature regimens and might serve as markers for grain development. These comparisons also revealed a number of genes with transcript profiles that were shifted under high temperatures in a manner that was not consistent with developmental events. These genes may be involved in responses to high temperature that are distinct from effects on the timing of developmental processes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID GENE
AB A total of 350 rapid amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers and 100 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs were screened to identify polymorphic markers associated with powdery mildew resistance. Only primer OPP15 produced a 900bp reproducible DNA fragment (OPP15(900)) in the resistant parent cv. Brock and most of the resistant individuals, but this DNA fragment was absent in susceptible parent Jing411 and Line 015. The progeny, including 218 resistant and 81 susceptible lines, derived from a cross Line 015/Brock//Jing411(2) was used for linkage analysis. 209 resistant and 8 susceptible individuals yielded OPP15(900) products, but 73 susceptible and 9 resistant ones yielded no OPP15(900) products. One dominant RAPD molecular marker OPP15(900) linked to powdery mildew resistance gene was identified in Brock with a genetic distance of 6.0 cM. A SSR marker Xgwm114 was also proved to link with the powdery mildew resistance and genetic distance of 9.3 cM. These two new molecular markers are useful for facilitating selection and pyramiding the resistance genes in wheat breeding.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), was the most destructive disease of wheat in Indiana and adjacent states before deployment of the resistance gene Stb1 during the early 1970s. Since then, Stb1 has provided durable protection against STB in widely grown wheat cultivars. However, its chromosomal location and allelic relationships to most other STB genes are not known, so the molecular mapping of Stb1 is of great interest. Genetic analyses and molecular mapping were performed for two mapping populations. A total of 148 F-1 plants (mapping population I) were derived from a three-way cross between the resistant line P881072-75-1 and the susceptible lines P881072-75-2 and Monon, and 106 F-6 recombinant-inbred lines (mapping population II) were developed from a cross between the resistant line 72626E2-12-9-1 and the susceptible cultivar Arthur. Bulked-segregant analysis with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers was conducted to identify those that were putatively linked to the Stb1 gene. Segregation analyses confirmed that a single dominant gene controls the resistance to M. graminicola in each mapping population. Two RAPD markers, G7(1200) and H19(520), were tightly linked to Stb1 in wheat line P881072-75-1 at distances of less than 0.68 cM and 1.4 cM, respectively. In mapping population II, the most closely linked marker was SSR Xbarc74, which was 2.8 cM proximal to Stb1 on chromosome 5BL. Microsatellite loci Xgwm335 and Xgwm213 also were proximal to Stb1 at distances of 7.4 cM and 8.3 cM, respectively. The flanking AFLP marker, EcoRI-AGC/MseI-CTA-1, was 8.4 cM distal to Stb1. The two RAPD markers, G71200 and H19520, and AFLP ECORI-AGC/MseI-CTA-1, were cloned and sequenced for conversion into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Only RAPD allele H19(520) could be converted successfully, and none of the SCAR markers was diagnostic for the Stb1 locus. Analysis of SSR and the original RAPD primers on several 5BL deletion stocks positioned the Stb1 locus in the region delineated by chromosome breakpoints at fraction lengths 0.59 and 0.75. The molecular markers tightly linked to Stb1 could be useful for marker-assisted selection and for pyramiding of Stb1 with other genes for resistance to M. graminicola in wheat.

AB Polymorphisms between the coding sequences of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin x-type genes at the Glu-1 locus were used to amplify Glu-1B x-type-specific PCR fragments. PCR analysis in a wheat cultivar subset carrying different Glu-1B x-type alleles resulted in PCR fragments that differed in size for Glu-B1-1d (B-x6) and non-Glu-B1-1d (B-x6) genotypes. Subsequent sequencing analysis revealed a 15-bp in-frame insertion in the coding regions of all Glu-B1-1d (B-x6) genotypes which allowed the development of a B-x6-specific PCR assay for high-throughput allele sizing by ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The assay was validated in a set of 86 German wheat cultivars, and genotyping data unequivocally verified the presence of HMW glutenin subunits GLU-B1-1D (Bx-6) + GLU-B1-2A (By-8) by means of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results demonstrate that the PCR assay can be applied for the detection and negative selection of the 'poor breadmaking quality' GluB1-1d (B-x6) alleles in wheat breeding programs.

AB Root colonization and mitigation of NaCl stress on wheat seedlings were studied by inoculating seeds with Azospirillum lipoferum JA4::ngfp15 tagged with the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp). Colonization of wheat roots under 80 and 160 mM NaCl stress was similar to root colonization with this bacterial species under non-saline conditions, that is, single cells and small aggregates were mainly located in the root hair zone. These salt concentrations had significant inhibitory effects on development of seedlings, but not on growth in culture of gfp-A. lipoferum JA4::ngfp15. Reduced plant growth (height and dry weight of leaves and roots) under continuous irrigation with 160 mM NaCl was ameliorated by bacterial inoculation with gfp-A. lipoferum JA4::ngfp15. Inoculation of plants subjected to continuous irrigation with 80 mM NaCl or to a single application of either NaCl concentration (80 or 160 mM NaCl) did not mitigate salt stress. This study indicates that, under high NaCl concentration, inoculation with modified A. lipoferum reduced the deleterious effects of NaCl; colonization patterns on roots were unaffected and the genetic marker did not induce undesirable effects on the interaction between the bacterium and the plants.

AB We attempted to develop a PCR-based marker that detects various segments of rye chromosome incorporated into wheat. We designed three sets of PCR primers based on the nucleotide sequence data of a rye repetitive sequence previously reported. One of the primer sets amplified a clear ca. 1.4 kb fragment in a rye cultivar but not in any form of wheat, diploid, tetraploid or hexaploid. We used this critical primer set for PCR of various wild species and cultivars of rye, an array of wheat plants carrying different rye chromosomes or small segments from different regions of rye chromosome 1R, and plants carrying parts of the rye B chromosome. The PCR amplified the 1.4 kb fragment in all the plant materials examined. We believe this PCR primer set will be useful as a universal PCR-based marker for the introgression of rye chromosome segments in the wheat genome.

AB In several crop species within the Triticeae tribe of the grass family Poaceae, single major aluminum (Al) tolerance genes have been identified that effectively mitigate Al toxicity, a major abiotic constraint to crop production on acidic soils. However, the trait is quantitatively inherited in species within other tribes, and the possible ancestral relationships between major Al tolerance genes and QTL in the grasses remain unresolved. To help establish these relationships, we conducted a molecular genetic analysis of Al tolerance in sorghum and integrated our findings with those from previous studies performed in crop species belonging to different grass tribes. A single locus, Alt(SB), was found to control Al tolerance in two highly Al tolerant sorghum cultivars. Significant macrosynteny between sorghum and the Triticeae was observed for molecular markers closely linked to putatively orthologous Al tolerance loci present in the group 4 chromosomes of wheat, barley, and rye. However, Alt(SB) was not located within the homeologous region of sorghum but rather mapped near the end of sorghum chromosome 3. Thus, Alt(SB) not only is the first major Al tolerance gene mapped in a grass species that does not belong to the Triticeae, but also appears to be different from the major Al tolerance locus in the Triticeac. Intertribe map comparisons suggest that a major Al tolerance QTL on rice chromosome 1 is likely to be orthologous to Alt(SB), whereas another rice QTL on chromosome 3 is likely to correspond to the Triticeae group 4 Al tolerance locus. Therefore, this Study demonstrates a clear evolutionary link between genes and QTL encoding the same trait in distantly related species within a single plant family.

AB Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) has proven a powerful tool for tagging genes or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of interest in plants. However, conversion of AFLP markers into sequence-tagged site (STS) markers is technically challenging in wheat owing to the complicated nature of its genome. In this study, we developed an "extension-AFLP" method to convert AFLP markers associated with Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance into STS markers. When an AFLP marker of interest was detected with an EcoRI+3-MseI+4-selective primer combination, the PCR product was used as a template for an additional selective amplification with four primer pairs, in which one additional selective base (either A, C, G, or T) was added to the 3' end of one of the two primers. The extended primer pair that produced the targeted band was further extended by adding each of the four selective nucleotide bases for the next round of selective amplification. Extension selective amplification was performed until the target bands became clear enough for subsequent cloning and sequencing. By using the extension-AFLP method, we successfully converted two AFLP markers located on chromosome 3BS and associated with FHB resistance into STS markers. Our results indicated that the extension-AFLP method is an efficient approach for converting AFLP markers into STS markers in wheat. The developed STS markers might be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) for FHB resistance in wheat breeding programs.

AB The quality of wheat grain is largely determined by the quantity and composition of storage proteins (prolamins) and depends on mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of prolamin genes. The endosperm-specific wheat basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor storage protein activator (SPA) is a positive regulator that binds to the promoter of a prolamin gene. The aim of this study was to map SPA (the gene encoding bZIP factor SPA) and recombinant inbred lines genomic regions associated with quantitative variations of storage protein fractions using F-7 (RILs) derived from a cross between Triticum aestivum 'Renan' and T aestivum 'Recital'. SPA was mapped through RFLP using a cDNA probe and a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker. Storage protein fractions in the parents and RILs were quantified using capillary electrophoresis. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for protein were detected and mapped on six chromosome regions. One QTL, located on the long arm of chromosome 1B, explained 70% of the variation in quantity of the x subunit of Glu-B1. Genetic mapping suggested that SPA is located on chromosome arm 1L and is also present in the confidence interval of the corresponding QTL for Glu-Blx on 1BL, suggesting that SPA might be a candidate gene for this QTL.

DT Article
DE ISSR; Triticum aestivum; amplification; genetic diversity
AB The development of molecular markers during the last years makes it possible to establish new approaches to improve the strategies of selection. The molecular markers become an essential tool in the selection programs of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) for resistance to diseases offering alternative solutions to the inherent problems to the use of the traditional phenotypical markers. The improvement of resistance to diseases in wheat via ISSR molecular markers associated with target genes will contribute to the improvement of the output of this cereal culture of great economic importance. In this article, we present results of polymerase chain amplification reactions carried out by using oligonucleotidic primers specific to inter-simple sequence repeat ISSR (into 5') in 28 varieties of wheat. The goal of this work was to develop a simple and not-radioactive method to reveal polymorphisms among areas containing inter-simple sequence repeats ISSRs and also to determine the genetic relations between 28 known varieties. Six primers containing a dinucleotidic sequence (AG)8CA, (AG)8TA were used to reveal this polymorphism. The SN39 F2 primer is most polymorphic with a high number of markers (6). Thus a dendrogramme was established using the unweighted pair-group method analyzed (UPGMA) program and one could conclude a correlation with the geographical origin.

AB Wheat gluten causes gut inflammation. in genetically predisposed individuals. We tested the hypothesis that wheat gluten is not only a target of adaptive immunity, but also modulates the function of APC. Dendritic cells (DC) derived from the bone marrow of BALB/c mice were exposed to chymotrypsin-treated wheat gluten. This induced DC maturation as estimated by all surface markers tested (MHC class 11, CD40, CD54, and CD86). The effect was dose dependent, and, at 100 mug/ml gluten matched that caused by 10 ng/ml LPS. A role of endotoxin contamination was ruled out by demonstrating the resistance of wheat gluten effects to LPS antagonist polymyxin B. DC from LPS nonresponder strain C3H/HeJ were affected by wheat gluten, but not by LPS. Proteinase K-digested wheat gluten was unable to stimulate DC maturation. Wheat gluten induced a unique secretion pattern of selected cytokines and chemokines in DC. Classic pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators were not produced, in contrast to LIPS. Rather, chemokines MIP-2 and keratinocyte-derived cytokine were secreted in large amounts. We conclude that wheat gluten lowers the threshold for immune responses by causing maturation of APC, by attracting leukocytes and increasing their reactivity state. In the presence of an appropriate genetic predisposition, this is expected to increase the risk of adverse immune reactions to wheat gluten or to other Ags presented.

AB We have developed 85 new markers (50 RFLPs, 5 SSRs, 12 DD cDNAs, 9 ESTs, 8 HSP-encoding cDNAs and one BSA-derived AFLP marker) for saturation mapping of QTL regions for drought tolerance in rice, in our efforts to identify putative candidate genes. Thirteen of the markers were localized in the close vicinity of the targeted QTL regions. Fifteen of the additional markers mapped, respectively, inside one QTL region controlling osmotic adjustment on chromosome 3 ( oa3.1) and 14 regions that affect root traits on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12. Differential display was used to identify more putative candidate genes and to saturate the QTL regions of the genetic map. Eleven of the isolated cDNA clones were found to be derived from drought-inducible genes. Two of them were unique and did not match any genes in the GenBank, while nine were highly similar to cDNAs encoding known proteins, including a DnaJ-related protein, a zinc-finger protein, a protease inhibitor, a glutathione-S-transferase, a DNA recombinase, and a protease. Twelve new cDNA fragments were mapped onto the genetic linkage map; seven of these mapped inside, or in close proximity to, the targeted QTL regions determining root thickness and osmotic adjustment capacity. The gene I12A1, which codes for a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase homolog, was identified as a putative target gene within the prt7.1/brt7.1 QTL region, as it is involved in the cell wall biogenesis pathway and hence may be implicated in modulating the ability of rice roots to penetrate further into the substratum when exposed to drought conditions. RNAs encoding elongation factor 1beta, a DnaJ-related protein, and a homolog of wheat zinc-finger protein were more prominently induced in the leaves of IR62266 (the lowland rice parent of the mapping materials used) than in those of CT9993 (the upland rice parent) under drought conditions. Homologs of 18S ribosomal RNA, and mRNAs for a multiple-stress induced zinc-finger protein, a protease inhibitor, and a glutathione-S-transferase were expressed at significantly higher levels in CT9993 than in IR62266. Thus several genes involved in the regulation of DNA structure and mRNA translation were found to be drought-regulated, and may be implicated in drought resistance.

AB Breeding for genetic resistance against greenbug and Russian wheat aphid (RWA) is the most effective way of controlling these widespread pests in wheat. Earlier work had shown that chromosome 7D of a synthetic hexaploid wheat, 'Synthetic' (T. dicoccoides x Ae. squarrosa) (AABB x DD) gave resistance when transferred into the genetic background of an aphid-susceptible cultivar, 'Chinese Spring', as the recipient. To map the genes involved, a set of 103 doubled haploid recombinant substitution lines was obtained from crossing the 7D substitution line with the recipient, and used to determine the number and chromosomal location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling antixenosis and antibiosis types of resistance. Antixenosis to RWA was significantly associated with marker loci Xpsr687 on 7DS, and Xgwm437 on 7DL. Antibiosis to greenbug was associated with marker loci Xpsr490, Rc3 (on 7DS), Xgwm44, Xgwm111, Xgwm437, Xgwm121 and D67 (on 7DL). Similarly, antibiosis to RWA was linked to loci Xpsr490, Rc3, Xgwm44, Xgwm437 and Xgwm121. At least two QTL in repulsion phase, one close to the centromere either on the 7DS or 7DL arms, and a second distal on 7DL could explain antibiosis to RWA and, partially, this mechanism against greenbug.

AB The genetic map of rye contains predominantly restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers but also a limited number of microsatellite markers, which are known to be more reliable and easier to apply. We report here the saturation of the genomic map of rye with additional microsatellite-derived markers that we obtained from the rye expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and the Gatersleben collection of wheat microsatellite markers (WMS). A total of 99 loci (39 EST and 60 WMS) were mapped into the RFLP frameworks of four rye mapping populations consisting of 139, 64, 58 and 60 RFLPs, respectively. For another ten WMS loci, which amplified PCR products not polymorphic in any of the mapping populations, chromosome and chromosome arm locations were determined using wheat-rye addition lines. Chromosomes 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R and 7R were enriched with 9, 19, 9, 13, 27, 16 and 16 microsatellite loci, respectively. The microsatellite loci mapped were evenly distributed along the chromosomes, which is important for the further application of these markers for gene mapping or diversity studies in rye. Forty-four of the WMS loci mapped in rye were found to be homoeologous to those mapped in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).

AB Wild perennial Glycine species are an invaluable gene resource for the cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr., 2n=40]. However, these wild species have been largely unexplored in soybean breeding programs because of their extremely low crossability with soybean and the need to employ in vitro embryo rescue methods to produce F, hybrids. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers to identify gene introgression from G. tomentella, a wild perennial Glycine species, to soybean. A selection of 96 soybean simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was evaluated for cross-specific amplification and polymorphism in G. tomentella. Thirty-two SSR markers (33%) revealed specific alleles for G. tomentella PI 483218 (2n=78). These SSR markers were further examined with an amphidiploid line (2n=118) and monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs), each with 2n=40 chromosomes from soybean and one from G. tomentella. The results show that the use of SSR markers is a rapid and reliable method to detect G. tomentella chromosomes in MAALs. We also developed a cleaved amplification polymorphism sequence (CAPS) marker according to the sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions in soybean and G. tomentella. Four MAALs that carry the ITS (rDNA) locus from G. tomentella were identified. The SSR and ITS-CAPS markers will greatly facilitate the introgression and characterization of gene transfer from G. tomentella to soybean.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum; L.) cultivars with greater coleoptile elongation are preferred in low-precipitation dryland regions and in early-planted management systems of the Great Plains, but the presence of GA3 (gibberellin)-insensitive dwarfing genes tends to restrict coleoptile elongation. The agronomic value of Rht8 and the discovery of its diagnostic microsatellite marker, Xgwm 261, have accelerated breeders' interest in Rht8 as an alternative dwarfing gene. Our objectives were to determine allelic distributions at the marker locus in contemporary samples of hard winter and soft red winter wheat relative to samples of Chinese accessions from a Rht8-rich geographic region, and to compare coleoptile elongation in the presence or absence of Rht8 determined by the Xgwm 261 marker. The 165-bp (primarily hard winter wheats) and the 174-bp (primarily soft red winter wheats) alleles of Xgwm 261 were most frequent. About 8% of all U.S. accessions carried the 192-bp allele diagnostic for Rht8, compared with 64% of the Chinese accessions. Coleoptile length varied among accessions from 4.4 to 11.4 cm. Frequency distributions for 192- and non-192-bp genotypes showed no advantage of the 192-bp allele to coleoptile elongation. None of the 192-bp genotypes from the Great Plains showed greater coleoptile length than 'TAM 107', a hard red winter cultivar without Rht8 often chosen over contemporary cultivars for its greater emergence capacity with deeper seed placement. Since coleoptile elongation may be controlled by several quantitative trait loci, identifying only the presence of 192-bp allele of Xgwm 261 may be misleading if the primary motivation for its deployment is to increase coleoptile length in a semidwarf plant type.

AB Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus N., is a major insect pest of winter and spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in areas of the northern Great Plains. The primary control measure is use of resistant cultivars containing solid stems. Environmental effects on expression of the trait can be problematic, thus genetic markers would be useful. In this study, a doubled haploid (DH) winter wheat population derived from a 'Rampart' (solid stems) X 'Jerry' (hollow stems) cross was analyzed to identify molecular markers linked to genes controlling stem solidness. The DH population was genotyped with GWM and BARC microsatellite primers that spanned the wheat genome. To genotype the population efficiently, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to identify polymorphism between groups of solid stem and hollow stem individuals. Four microsatellite markers (GWM247, GWM340, GWM547, and BARC77) were found linked to a single solid stem QTL (designate Qss. msub-3BL) on chromosome 3BL. However GWM247, GWM340, and GWM547 were found to be more closely linked to the QTL than BARC77. Single marker analysis showed Qss.msub-3BL contributes at least 76% of the total variation for stem solidness. Additionally, no significant relationship existed between Qss.msub-3BL and other agronomic traits, including yield. These microsatellite markers (GWM247, GWM340, and GWM547) will be useful for selecting solid-stemmed wheat cultivars to help control the wheat stem sawfly.

AB dSeptoria tritici blotch (STB) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) J. Schrdt. in Cohn (anamorph: Septoria tritici Roberge in Desmaz.), occurs naturally in all wheat production areas around the world. Two genes for resistance to this disease, Stb2 and Stb3, have been identified in wheat germplasm and together confer resistance to the most prevalent strains of M. graminicola in Australia and the USA. However, so far neither gene has been mapped in the wheat genome and their linkage relationships to other markers are not known. The objectives of this study were to identify molecular markers linked to the STB resistance genes Stb2 and Stb3 and to map these genes in the wheat genome. Genetic families of doubled-haploid populations segregating for Stb2 and Stb3 were evaluated in the greenhouse for STB reaction during the spring and fall seasons of 2002 and 2003. Genomic DNA isolated from each segregating population was analyzed with microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers in bulked-segregant analysis to identify those that cosegregated with the STB phenotypes. Linkage analysis identified rive SSR markers near the Stb2 gene on the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 3B. Loci Xgwm389 and Xgwm533.1 were approximately 1 cM distal to Stb2, which itself was 3.7 cM distal to Xgwm493. In addition to Stb2, this genomic region contains multiple genes conferring resistance to taxonomically diverse fungal pathogens of wheat, including a major quantitative trait locus for resistance to Fusarium head blight (caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe). The SSR marker Xgdm132 was linked to the Stb3 gene at a distance of approximately 3 cM on the short arm of chromosome 6D. The microsatellite markers identified in this study should facilitate marker-assisted selection and pyramiding of Stb2 and Stb3 with other STB resistance genes for more durably resistant wheat.

AB With the advent of herbicide-resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), there is a concern with the potential for gene migration between wheat and jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host.). This is especially true for genes on the D genome, since this genome is shared by wheat and jointed goatgrass. To study the potential for gene migration, BC1 and BC2 plants were produced with jointed goatgrass as the male recurrent parent. To determine if wheat chromatin was retained at expected Mendelian frequencies in these backcrosses, 14 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers associated with the long and short arms of the D genome chromosomes were used. Chi-square analysis showed that 12 of the 14 markers fit the expected ratio for retention of wheat alleles in the BC1 generation. In the BC2 generation, 11 of the 14 markers fit the expected frequencies for the retention of wheat alleles. The markers not fitting the expected frequencies in both generations deviated in the direction of more heterozygotes than expected, indicating a higher than expected retention of wheat alleles. Furthermore, recombination between the D genome chromosomes of the two species was observed. On the basis of these results, it appears that it is possible for a gene on the D genome of wheat to move into jointed goatgrass if the BC1 and BC2 generations were produced in the field.

AB The object of this study was to discover new QTL controlling grain texture and protein quantity which could be of use for plant breeders for directed plant breeding by marker-assisted selection. A series of precise genetic stocks of wheat developed between the good bread-making quality parent, Avalon, and a biscuit wheat, Hobbit Sib, were used for this purpose. Analysis of a population of Hobbit Sib (Avalon 5A) recombinant substitution lines revealed two new year-on-year, consistent, putative (non-significant) QTL, one associated with grain protein content and one with grain texture. Analysis of Hobbit Sib (Avalon 5D) recombinant substitution lines revealed strong, statistically significant and consistent associations between the known hardness locus, Ha, and grain texture, and between a new QTL on the long arm, with grain protein content. Analysis of a population of Hobbit Sib x Avalon recombinant inbred lines revealed year-on-year consistent, statistically significant, new QTL for protein content on chromosomes 213, 613 and 7A, and for texture on chromosome I B.

AB Sedoheptulose-1, 7-bisphosphatase (SBPase, EC 3.1.3.37) regulates the flow of carbon through the Calvin cycle. To investigate its regulatory character and expression pattern, the gene encoding SBPase in rice has been cloned by RACE. A full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 1179 bp that encodes 392 amino acid residues was obtained from an indica rice variety, 93-11. The OsSbp is a single locus gene in the rice genome. It is localized in the region of 8.42-8.59 Mb on the short arm of chromosome 4, flanked by markers R288 and S11182. RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsSbp gene is expressed in all the tissues we tested, and OsSbp transcript level can be dramatically boosted by light illumination. Its expression is down-regulated by externally applied NaCl, ABA, MeJA and glucose over 24 h, whereas up-regulated by GA after 24 h treatments. These results indicated that OsSbp gene expression is modulated by these factors at multiple levels.

AB Structural and functional relationships between the genomes of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (2n=6x=42) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (2n=2x=24) were evaluated using linkage maps supplemented with simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci obtained from publicly available expressed sequence tags (ESTs). EST-SSR markers were developed using two main strategies to design primers for each gene: (1) primer design for multiple species based on supercluster analysis, and (2) species-specific primer design. Amplification was more consistent using the species-specific primer design for each gene. Forty-four percent of the primers designed specifically for wheat sequences were successful in amplifying DNA from both species. Existing genetic linkage maps were enhanced for the wheat and rice genomes using orthologous loci amplified with 58 EST-SSR markers obtained from both wheat and rice ESTs. The PCR-based anchor loci identified by these EST-SSR markers support previous patterns of conservation between wheat and rice genomes; however, there was a high frequency of interrupted colinearity. In addition, multiple loci amplified by these primers made the comparative analysis more difficult. Enhanced comparative maps of wheat and rice provide a useful tool for interpreting and transferring molecular, genetic, and breeding information between these two important species. These EST-SSR markers are particularly useful for constructing comparative framework maps for different species, because they amplify closely related genes to provide anchor points across species.

AB The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), is one of the major pests of wheat worldwide. The efficient utilization of wheat genes expressing resistance to greenbug infestation is highly dependent on a clear understanding of their relationships. The use of such genes will be further facilitated through the use of molecular markers linked to resistance genes. The present study involved several F-2 wheat populations derived from crosses between susceptible cultivars and resistant germplasm carrying different greenbug resistance genes. These populations were used to characterize the inheritance of a wheat gene (Gbz) conferring tolerance to greenbug biotype I, to identify molecular markers linked to Gbz, and to investigate the relationship between Gbz and Gb3, a previously identified greenbug resistance gene. Our results indicated that Gbz is inherited as a single dominant gene. Microsatellite marker Xwmc157 is completely linked to Gbz, and Xbarc53 and Xgdm46 flank Gbz at distances of 5.1 and 9.5 cM, respectively. Selection of Gbz using marker Xwmc157 alone gives breeders 100% selection accuracy. Gbz may be placed in the distal region of the long arm of the wheat chromosome 7D. The results of allelism tests indicated that Gbz is either allelic or tightly linked to Gb3.

AB The distal segment of the long arm of the Thinopyrum intermedium chromosome 7Ai1 carries the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance gene Bdv2. This segment was transferred to the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 7D in the Yw series of translocation lines by using the ph1b mutant to induce homoeologous pairing. To transfer Bdv2 to commercial varieties, we developed two resistance gene-analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers, Tgp-1(350) and Tgp-2(210), and one randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker, OPD04(1300). The diagnostic fragments of the RGAP marker Tgp-1(350) and the RAPD marker OPD04(1300) were cloned, sequenced and converted into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, named SC-gp1 and SC-D04, respectively. SC-gp1 and SC-D04 were validated based on available translocation lines and segregating F-2 individuals. Our results indicated that the SCAR markers co-segregated with the BYDV resistance associated with Bdv2. Therefore, they can be used as a low-cost, high-throughput alternative to conventional phenotypic screening in wheat-breeding programs exploiting Bdv2. The marker-assisted selection for BYDV resistance was successfully performed in a wheat-breeding program.

AB We have developed from crosses of oat (Avena sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) 50 fertile lines that are disomic additions of individual maize chromosomes 1-9 and chromosome 10 as a short-arm telosome. The whole chromosome 10 addition is available only in haploid oat background. Most of the maize chromosome disomic addition lines have regular transmission; however, chromosome 5 showed diminished paternal transmission, and chromosome 10 is transmitted to offspring only as a short-arm telosome. To further dissect the maize genome, we irradiated monosomic additions with gamma rays and recovered radiation hybrid (RH) lines providing low- to medium-resolution mapping for most of the maize chromosomes. For maize chromosome 1, mapping 45 simple-sequence repeat markers delineated 10 groups of RH plants reflecting different chromosome breaks. The present chromosome 1 RH panel dissects this chromosome into eight physical segments defined by the 10 groups of RH lines. Genomic in situ hybridization revealed the physical size of a distal region, which is represented by six of the eight physical segments, as being approximate to20% of the length of the short arm, representing approximate toone-third of the genetic chromosome 1 map. The distal approximate to20% of the physical length of the long arm of maize chromosome 1 is represented by a single group of RH lines that spans >23% of the total genetic map. These oat-maize RH lines provide valuable tools for physical mapping of the complex highly duplicated maize genome and for unique studies of interspecific gene interactions.

In order to identify molecular keys characterizing both T. aestivum and T. uncinatum morphotypes, ITS/RFLPs analyses were carried out on a large collection of samples from all over Italy and from other European countries, followed by a study of the phylogenesis of ITS, beta-tubulin and EF 1-alpha genes, on representative samples. The present study provides compelling evidence that: (i) T. uncinatum and T. aestivum belong to the same species, (ii) neither morphotype presents a specific molecular fingerprint, but they may even share identical alleles at any of the loci analysed; (iii) T. aestivum is most likely under a selfing reproductive mode. Our findings Suggest that ecological, rather than genetic causes may account for differences in sporal morphology, taste and smell between T. aestivum and T. uncinatum truffles.

AB We investigated the utility of the Gossypium arboreum EST sequences in the GenBank database for developing PCR-based markers targeting known-function genes in cultivated tetraploid cottons, G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. Four hundred sixty-five randomly selected ESTs from this library were subjected to BLASTn search against all GenBank databases, of which putative function was assigned to 93 ESTs based on high nucleotide homology to previously studied genes. PCR primers were synthesized for 89 of the known-function ESTs. A total of 57 primer pairs amplified G. arboreum genomic DNA, but only 39 amplified in G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, suggesting that sequence divergence may be a factor causing non-amplification for some sites. DNA sequence analysis showed that most primer pairs were targeting the expected homologous loci. While the amplified products that were of larger size than the corresponding EST sequences contain introns, the primer pairs with a smaller amplicon than predicted from the flanking EST sequences did not amplify the expected orthologous gene sequences. Among the 39 primer pairs that amplified tetraploid cotton DNA, 3 detected amplicon size polymorphisms and 10 detected polymorphisms after digestion with one of six restriction enzymes. Ten of the polymorphic loci were subsequently mapped to an anchor RFLP map. Digestion of PCR-amplified sequences offers one means by which cotton genes can be mapped to their chromosomal locations more quickly and economically than by RFLP analysis.

AB One of the major environmental factors limiting plant productivity is lack of water. This is especially true for the major cereals maize, rice, and wheat, which demonstrate a range of susceptibility to moisture deficit. Although conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection are being used to develop varieties more tolerant to water stress, these methods are time and resource consuming and germplasm dependent. Genetic engineering is attractive because of its potential to improve abiotic stress tolerance more rapidly. Transcription factors have been shown to produce multiple phenotypic alterations, many of which are involved in stress responses. DREB1A, a transcription factor that recognizes dehydration response elements, has been shown in Arabidopsis thaliana to play a crucial role in promoting the expression of drought-tolerance genes. In our efforts to enhance drought tolerance in wheat, the A. thaliana DREB1A gene was placed under control of a stress-inducible promoter from the rd29A gene and transferred via biolistic transformation into bread wheat. Plants expressing the DREB1A gene demonstrated substantial resistance to water stress in comparison with checks under experimental greenhouse conditions, manifested by a 10-day delay in wilting when water was withheld.

AB Aluminium (X) toxicity is an important limitation to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on acid soil. Al-resistant cultivars of barley detoxify Al externally by secreting citrate from the roots. To link the genetics and physiology of Al resistance in barley, genes controlling Al resistance and Al-activated secretion of citrate were mapped. An analysis of Al-induced root growth inhibition from 100 F-2 seedlings derived from an Al-resistant cultivar (Murasakimochi) and an Al-sensitive cultivar (Morex) showed that a gene associated with Al resistance is localized on chromosome 4H, tightly linked to microsatellite marker Bmag353. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis from 59 F-4 seedlings derived from an F-3 plant heterozygous at the region of Al resistance on chromosome 4H showed that a gene responsible for the Al-activated secretion of citrate was also tightly linked to microsatellite marker Bmag353. This QTL explained more than 50% of the phenotypic variation in citrate secretion in this population. These results indicate that the gene controlling Al resistance on barley chromosome 4H is identical to that for Al-activated secretion of citrate and that the secretion of citrate is one of the mechanisms of X resistance in barley. The identification of the microsatellite marker associated with both Al resistance and citrate secretion provides a valuable tool for marker-assisted selection of Al-resistant lines.

AB Rumex acetosa L. is a dioecious flowering plant with a well developed sex chromosome system: 2n = 12 + XX in the female plants and 2n = 12 + XY1Y2 in the male plants. To isolate and characterize sex-linked DNA, we used the RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA) method, Southern blot analysis, and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). As a result of the RAPD analysis, one male-specific DNA segment was identified and was designated as RAY-1.5 (R acetosa Y chromosome enriched 1.5 k bp sequence). RAY-1.5 consists of two tandemly repeated sequences in the 5'-region and has an identical sequence to the Y chromosome specific and male enriched sequences. Southern blot analysis and FISH supported the assumption that RAY-1.5 is a male-specific, Y chromosome enriched repetitive DNA. Although RAY-1.5 has similarities to known male specific or enriched sequences, it was discovered to be a new sex-related DNA in R acetosa.

AB The genetic relationships between isolates of Puccinia triticina virulent on wheat with the Lr26 resistance gene were Studied. The diversity within and between isolates of P triticina from Israel, Europe, and the United States was determined by virulence on near-isogenic Thatcher lines and by random amplified polymorphic DNA. According to the molecular markers, isolates that were virulent on Lr26 had diversity levels similar to those of Lr26 nonpathogenic isolates. Distances between subpopulations of isolates virulent and avirulent on Lr26 varied and were unrelated to the Lr26 virulence phenotype. Cluster analysis suggested four groups, three of which were closely associated with the geographical origin of the isolates-Israel, the United States, and Europe. All four groups included both Lr26 virulent and avirulent pathotypes. The results showed that Lr26 virulent rust pathotypes are as genetically dissimilar as the rest of the population. The cluster analysis showed that the rust population in Israel includes at least two different subpopulations, both of which contain Lr26 virulent and Lr26 avirulent isolates.

AB Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a genome-specific repeat, Spelt1, and wheat simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to analyse the chromosome constitution of two Triticum aestivum x Aegilops speltoides introgressive lines. The lines 170/98i and 178/98i carried one and two subtelomeric regions of Ae. speltoides (per haploid genome), respectively, marked by Spelt1 repeats according to FISH data. SSR analysis detected homoeologous substitution of wheat chromosome 7D with Ae. speltoides chromosome 7S in the lines 178/98i and 170/98i as well as the assumed terminal translocation in the short arm of chromosome 3A in the line 178/98i. Anthocyanin pigmentation of the coleoptiles was found in the lines 170/98i and 178/98i and resulted from the 7S (7D) substitution. It was demonstrated that Spelt1 could be effectively used for the rapid identification (without DNA isolation) of terminal translocations of T. aestivum x Ae. speltoides introgressive lines as well as for further analysis of the stability of the hybrid plants.

AB The renewed interest in spelt (Triticum spelta L.) for wheat improvement programmes requires the study of the available genetic diversity. The purpose of this study was to assess genetic diversity within a Spanish spelt collection. Sixty-six Spanish spelt accessions, 19 accessions of T. spelta and T. macha from different origins, three bread wheat cultivars (T. aestivum) and one accession of T. dicoccum were screened using simple sequence repeats (SSRs). The diversity observed within the Spanish group was comparable with that observed in the other wheat varieties, despite their broader geographical diversity. Indeed, the highest polymorphic information content value calculated with SSRs for Spanish material (0.90) is similar to that observed for the other wheat varieties (0.98). Principal component analysis explained 46.5% of the cumulative variation and confirmed the Spanish accessions as a separate group. This study showed the Spanish spelt collection to be a variable and unique genetic resource for wheat and spelt breeding programmes.

AB TAXI (Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor) proteins are present in wheat flour and are known to inhibit glycosyl hydrolase family 11 endoxylanases, enzymes which are commonly applied in grain processing. Here, we describe the PCR-based molecular identification of genes encoding endoxylanase inhibitors HVXI and SCXI, the TAXI-like proteins from barley (Hordeum vulgare) and rye (Secale cereale) respectively. The HVXI coding sequence encodes a mature protein of 384 amino acids preceded by a 19 amino acid long signal sequence. SCXI-II/III has an open reading frame encoding a signal peptide of 21 amino acids and a mature protein of 375 amino acids. As for TAXI-I, no introns were detected in the untranslated regions and coding sequences identified. These newly identified sequences allowed us to perform a multiple sequence alignment with TAXI-I and similar proteins. Rice TAXI-type proteins clustered together with the cereal endoxylanase inhibitors. Dicotyledonous proteins with sequence similarity to TAXI-I, including the tomato xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase inhibiting protein, formed a different clade. The TAXI-type proteins may hence be part of a superfamily of proteins all involved in plant responses to biotic or abiotic stress and for which a function as glycosyl hydrolase inhibitors can be suggested. The chromosomal localization of the TAXI-I gene identified on wheat chromosome 3B, of the SCXI-II/III gene identified on rye chromosome 6R, and the presence of a cluster of TAXI-like genes on rice chromosome 1, allowed us to assign the location of TAXI-like genes to the wheat-rye translocation area 3BL/6RL characterized by RFLP markers XGlb33 and Xpsr454 and isozyme Est-5. In rice, RFLP marker C1310S corresponds to a TAXI-like protein encoding sequence.

AB Gene tagging is the basis of marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. To develop PCR-based markers for Pm4a, a dominant powdery mildew resistance gene of wheat, we surveyed 46 group 2 microsatellite markers between Pm4a near-isogenic line (NIL) CI 14124 and the recurrent parent Chancellor (Cc). One of the markers, gwm356, detected polymorphism and was used for genotyping an F-2 population of 85 plants derived from CI 14124 x Cc. Linkage mapping indicated that Xgwm356 was linked to Pm4a at a distance of 4.8 cM. To identify more PCR-based markers for Pm4a, we also converted the restriction fragment length polymorphism marker BCD1231 linked to it into a sequence-tagged site (STS) marker. The STS primer designed based on the end sequences of BCD1231 amplified an approximately 1.6-kb monomorphic band in both parents. Following digestion of the products with the four-cutter enzymes HaeIII and MspI, it was discovered that the band from CI 14124 consisted of at least two products, one of which had a digestion pattern different from the band from Cc. In the F-2 population, the cleaved polymorphism revealed by the STS marker between the parents co-segregated with powdery mildew resistance. To design Pm4a-specific PCR markers, the 1.6-kb band from Cc and the fragment associated with Pm4a in CI 14124 were sequenced and compared. Based on these sequences a new PCR marker was identified, which detected a 470-bp product only in the Pm4a-containing lines. These PCR-based markers provide a cost-saving option for marker-assisted selection of Pm4a.

AB Segregation analysis of resistance to powdery mildew in a F-2 progeny from the cross Chinese Spring (CS) x TA2682c revealed the inheritance of a dominant and a recessive powdery mildew resistance gene. Selfing of susceptible F-2 individuals allowed the establishment of a mapping population segregating exclusively for the recessive resistance gene. The extracted resistant derivative showing full resistance to each of 11 wheat powdery mildew isolates was designated RD30. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of bulked segregants from F(3)s showing the homozygous susceptible and resistant phenotypes revealed an AFLP marker that was associated with the recessive resistance gene in repulsion phase. Following the assignment of this AFLP marker to wheat chromosome 7A by means of CS nullitetrasomics, an inspection of simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci evenly spaced along chromosome 7A showed that the recessive resistance gene maps to the distal region of chromosome 7AL. On the basis of its close linkage to the Pm1 locus, as inferred from connecting partial genetic maps of 7AL of populations CS x TA2682c and CS x Virest (Pm1e), and its unique disease response pattern, the recessive resistance gene in RD30 was considered to be novel and tentatively designated mlRD30.

AB Spot blotch, caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana (Sacc.) Shoem. syn. Drechslera sorokiniana (Sacc.) Subrm and Jain (syn. Helminthosporium sativum, teleomorph Cochliobolus sativus), is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in warmer and humid regions of the world. To date, no morphological marker is known to be associated with resistance to this disease. The purpose of this study was to find out the association of leaf tip necrosis (Ltn) with resistance to spot blotch disease. A total of 1407 spring wheat genotypes that originated from the Indian and CIMMYT wheat breeding programs were evaluated for Ltn and resistance to spot blotch for three seasons (1994-1995, 1995-1996, and 1996-1997) under field conditions. Disease severity was recorded at six growth stages under artificially created epidemics. About 75% of the genotypes showing Ltn (Ltn+) were resistant or moderately resistant, whereas 82% not showing it (Ltn-) were moderately susceptible or susceptible. Mean spot blotch rating of the Ltn+ genotypes was significantly lower than the Ltn- genotypes at all growth stages and the genotype X environment interaction was nonsignificant. To confirm the association of Ltn with resistance, individual F-2-derived F-3, F-4, F-5, and F-6 progenies from the cross of the 'HUW234' near-isogenic pair for Ltn were evaluated for spot blotch severity. In each generation, the Ltn+ homozygous progenies had significantly less disease than those homozygous Ltn-. These results confirm that leaf tip necrosis is associated with moderate resistance to spot blotch and can be used as a morphological marker to facilitate selection for resistance.

AB Aluminum tolerance of two sets of hexaploid triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) lines with disomic substitutions of the D-genome chromosomes from Triticum aestivum L. was analyzed by the modified-pulse method. Of the 20 substitution lines in winter triticale Presto, and 18 lines of spring triticale Rhino, six and nine lines, respectively, showed improved tolerance relative to that observed in the control lines. The D-genome chromosomes in substitutions 1D(1B), 3D(3A), 3D(3B), 4D(4A), 4D(4B) and 6D(6B) significantly (p<0.01) improved Al tolerance in both sets of lines. High percentages of tolerant plants were also observed in 2D(2B) and 5D(5A) substitutions in Presto and in 2D(2A), 2D(2B), 5D(5B), 6D(6A) and 7D(7A) substitution lines of Rhino. In no instance, the removal of individual rye chromosomes, by substitutions, improved Al tolerance of the recipient line. Moreover, the presence of a complete rye genome, and especially of chromosome 3R, was necessary for triticale's tolerance to aluminum. The results also indicated some effects of allelic variation present on both rye and wheat chromosomes, and a possibility of interactions of various factors.

AB Resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) to the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), a major insect pest of wheat, is based on a gene-for-gene interaction. Close linkage (3 +/- 2 cM) was discovered between Hessian fly avirulence genes vH3 and vH5. Bulked segregant analysis revealed two DNA markers (28-178 and 23-201) within 10 cM of these loci and only 3 +/- 2 cM apart. However, 28-178 was located in the middle of the short arm of Hessian fly chromosome A2 whereas 23-201 was located in the middle of the long arm of chromosome A2, suggesting the presence of severe recombination suppression over its proximal region. To further test that possibility, an AFLP-based genetic map of the Hessian fly genome was constructed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 20 markers on the genetic map to the polytene chromosomes of the Hessian fly indicated good correspondence between the linkage groups and the four Hessian fly chromosomes. The physically anchored genetic map is the first of any gall midge species. The proximal region of mitotic chromosome A2 makes up 30% of its length but corresponded to <3% of the chromosome A2 genetic map.

AB Based on different marker information content mapping of QTLs for Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat was compared with regard to number and consistency of detected QTLs as well as QTL positions and effects. Therefore, two linkage maps, obtained by 'dominant' and 'codominant genotyping' of hemizygous markers, were constructed with 211 AFLPs, 37 SSRs and the barley RGA marker XaACT/CAA. The 'codominant marker set' comprised 59% codominant markers, whereas the 'dominant map' consisted of only 13%. A segregating wheat population of 94 F-4-RILs was used for QTL analysis. Fusarium head blight resistance was estimated in field trials in six environments. Conventional 'dominant marker scoring' found seven QTLs. The phenotypic variations explained by QTLs detected in single environment analyses ranged from 11.1 to 44.6%. QTL analysis performed with the 'codominant marker set' confirmed not only all QTL positions as revealed by 'dominant QTL analysis', but also 12 additional QTLs were found. QTLs in single environments explained 36.3 up to 55.7% of the phenotypic variation. In the QTL analysis across all environments, none of the QTLs could be confirmed using 'dominant marker scoring'. However, by 'codominant QTL analysis' environment-specific QTLs were retrieved. STS marker XaACT/CAA was found to be significantly associated with FHB resistance only by 'codominant scoring'. Support intervals of QTLs commonly found in both marker sets averaged to 10.3 cM in the 'dominant QTL analysis', whereas the length was shortened to 8.9 cM by 'codominant genotyping'. The advantages of extracting codominant information from dominant markers are discussed.

AB In this study, comparative high resolution genetic mapping of the GA-insensitive dwarfing gene sdw3 of barley revealed highly conserved macrosynteny of the target region on barley chromosome 2HS with rice chromosome 7L. A rice contig covering the sdw3-orthologous region was identified and subsequently exploited for marker saturation of the target interval in barley. This was achieved by (1) mapping of rice markers from the orthologous region of the rice genetic map, (2) mapping of rice ESTs that had been physically localized on the rice contig, or (3) mapping of barley ESTs that show strong sequence similarity to coding sequences present in the rice contig. Finally, the sdw3 gene was mapped to an interval of 0.55 cM in barley, corresponding to a physical distance of about 252 kb in rice, after employing orthologous EST-derived rice markers. Three putative ORFs were identified in this interval in rice, which exhibited significant sequence similarity to known signal regulator genes from different species. These ORFs can serve as starting points for the map-based isolation of the sdw3 gene from barley.

AB PCR selection markers for the identification of null waxy alleles were used to screen for waxy mutations in 168 common wheat cultivars. In all cultivars where the Wx-B1 protein was absent, the Wx-B1 allele was identical to the previously identified mutation carried by Kanto 107. Although most cultivars missing the Wx-A1 protein also carried the same Wx-A1 mutation as found in Kanto 107, all of the Turkey Wx-A1 mutants produced a different PCR fragment, implying the presence of a different mutation. Sequencing of this fragment indicated the mutation, which consisted of a 173-bp insertion in an exon, was in a different location than the previously identified Wx-A1 mutation. An 8-bp duplication of the Wx-A1 sequence flanked each end of the insertion, and an element with reverse complementary sequences was present at both ends of the insertion. These structures correspond with the features of class II transposable elements. Hence, the Turkey null Wx-A1 mutation was likely caused by the movement of a transposon, and this spontaneous mutation appears to be present in a limited geographical area.

AB Amplification of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) is both a useful method for acquiring DNA markers closely linked to disease resistance (R) genes and a potential approach for the rapid cloning of R genes in plants. However, the screening of target sequences from among the numerous amplified RGAs can be very laborious. The amplification of RGAs from specific chromosomes could greatly reduce the number of RGAs to be screened and, consequently, speed up the identification of target RGAs. We have developed two methods for amplifying RGAs from single chromosomes. Method 1 uses products of Sau3A linker adaptor-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) from a single chromosome as the templates for RGA amplification, while Method 2 directly uses a single chromosomal DNA molecule as the template. Using a pair of degenerate primers designed on the basis of the conserved nucleotide-binding-site motifs in many R genes, RGAs were successfully amplified from single chromosomes of pomelo using both these methods. Sequencing and cluster analysis of RGA clones obtained from single chromosomes revealed the number, type and organization of R-gene clusters on the chromosomes. We suggest that Method 1 is suitable for analyzing chromosomes that are unidentifiable under a microscope, while Method 2 is more appropriate when chromosomes can be clearly identified.

AB Dwarf genes have been valuable for improving harvestable yield of several crop plants and may be useful in oilseed Brassica. We evaluated a dwarf gene, dwf2, from Brassica rapa in order to determine its phenotypic effects and genetic characteristics. The dwf2 mutant was insensitive to exogenous GA(3) for both plant height and flowering time, suggesting that it is not a mutation in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway. The dwarf phenotype was controlled by a semidominant allele at a single locus. Near-isogenic lines that were homozygous or heterozygous for dwf2 had 47.4% or 30.0% reduction in plant height, respectively, compared to the tall wild-type line, and the reduction was due to reduced internode length and number of nodes. The dwf2 homozygous and heterozygous lines had the same or significantly higher numbers of primary branches than the wild-type line, but did not differ in flowering time. The DWF2 gene was mapped to the bottom of linkage group R6, in a region having homology to the top of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 2. The map position of DWF2 in comparison to markers in A. thaliana suggests it is a homolog of RGA (repressor of ga1-3), which is a homolog of the wheat "Green Revolution" gene. This dwarf gene could be used to gain more insight on the gibberellin pathway and to reduce lodging problems in hybrid oilseed Brassica cultivars.

AB Four hundred and seventy-eight microsatellite markers derived from expressed sequence tags (EST-SSRs) were screened among three mapping populations (W-7984xOpata 85, WOpop; LumaixHanxuan, LHpop; WenmaixShanhongmai, WSpop). The number of polymorphic EST-SSR primer pairs found in WOpop, LHpop and WSpop was 92, 58 and 29 respectively. A total of 101 EST-SSR loci amplified from 88 primer sets were distributed over the 20 chromosomes of the reference maps (no markers were located on chromosome 4B). These 101 mapped EST-SSR markers add to the existing 450 microsatellite loci previously mapped in bread wheat. Seventy-four of the 101 loci showed significant similarities to known genes, including 24 genes involved in metabolism, 4 in cellular structures, 9 in stress resistance, 12 in transcription, 2 in development, 2 transporters and 21 storage proteins. Besides gliadin and glutenin, most of the 53 genes with putative functions were mapped for the first time by EST-SSR markers in bread wheat. Sequence alignment of the mapped wheat EST-SSR loci allowed tentative assignment of functionality to the other members of grasses family. Colinearity combined with homology information offers an attractive approach to comparative genomics.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling the plant-regeneration ability of Brassica oleracea protoplasts were mapped in a population of 128 F-2 plants derived from a cross between the high-responding, rapid-cycling line and a low-responding, broccoli breeding line of B. oleracea. A modified bulked segregant analysis with AFLP markers identified two QTLs for plant regeneration. In a multiple regression analysis, the two QTLs explained 83% of the total genetic variation for regeneration recorded 15 weeks after initial transfer of microcalli to regeneration medium. Both QTLs showed additive effects, and the alleles contributing to the high regeneration frequencies were derived from the high-responding, rapid-cycling line. Using microsatellites with known location, the two QTLs were mapped to linkage groups O2 and O9 on the map published by Sebastian et al. [(2000) Theor Appl Genet 100:75-81] or to chromosomes C8 and C7 on the map published by Saal et al. [(2001) Theor Appl Genet 102:695-699]. QTLs for the early flowering trait of the rapid-cycling parent have previously been mapped to the same two linkage groups. Association between flowering time and regeneration ability was, however, not found in the present material, indicating that plant-regeneration ability can be transferred between cultivars independently of the early flowering trait. The detection of two major QTLs for plant regeneration in B. oleracea may provide the initial step towards the identification of markers suitable for marker-assisted selection of regeneration ability.

AB The unique bread-making properties of wheat are closely correlated with composition and quantity of high-molecular-mass (HMW) glutenin subunits encoded by the Glu-1 genes. We report the development of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to identify bread wheat genotypes carrying HMW glutenin allele composition of Glu-1 complex loci (Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1) by capillary electrophoresis (CE) with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Two triplex primer sets of HMW glutenin subunit genes were examined. An automated and rapid CE-LIF technique is helpful in the multiplex PCR optimization process. Two fluorescent intercalating dyes (EnhanCE, and YO-PRO-1) are compared for detection of DNA fragments. Amplified DNA fragments of HMW glutenin Glu-1 genes were well separated both by agarose slab-gel electrophoresis and CE, and revealed minor differences between the sequences of 1Ax2*, 1Axnull, 1Bx6, 1Bx7, 1Bx17 and 1Dx5 genes. Moreover. CE technique requires samples of smaller volumes in comparison to slab-gel electrophoresis, and data can be obtained in less than 20 min. There was a very high concordance in the assessment of the molecular size of PCR-generated DNA markers. Fast and accurate identification of molecular markers of Glu-1 genes by CE-LIF can be an efficient alternative to standard procedure separation for early selection of useful wheat genotypes with good bread-making quality.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is considered to be a major problem for crop growth and production on acid soils. The ability of crops to overcome Al toxicity varies among crop species and cultivars. Rye (Secale cereale L.) is the most Al-tolerant species among the Triticeae. Our previous study showed that Al tolerance in a rye F-6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was controlled by a single gene designated as the aluminum tolerance (Alt3) gene on chromosome 4RL. Based on the DNA sequence of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) BAC clone suspected to be syntenic to the Alt3 gene region, we developed two PCR-based codominant markers flanking the gene. These two markers, a sequence-tagged site (STS) marker and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker, each flanked the Alt3 gene at an approximate distance of 0.4 cM and can be used to facilitate high-resolution mapping of the gene. The markers might also be used for marker-assisted selection in rye or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs to obtain M-tolerant lines and (or) cultivars.

AB Cultivated rye (Secale cereale L., 2n = 2x = 14, RR) is an important source of genes for insect and disease resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42). Rye chromosome arm IRS of S. cereale 'Kavkaz' originally found as a 1BL.1RS translocation, carries genes for disease resistance (e.g., Lr26, Sr31, Yr9, and Pm8), while IRS of the S. cereale 'Amigo' translocation (IRSA) Carries a single resistance gene for greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) biotypes B and C and also carries additional disease-resistance genes. The purpose of this research was to identify individual plants that were recombinant in the homologous region of .1AL.1RS(v) and 1AL.1RS(A) using both molecular and phenotypic markers. Secale cereale 'Nekota' (1AL.1RS(A)) and S. cereale 'Pavon 76' (1AL.1RS(v)) were mated and the F-1 was backcrossed to 'Nekota' (1AL.1AS) to generate eighty BC1F2:3 families (i.e., ('Nekota' 1AL.1RS(A) X 'Pavon 76' 1AL.1RS(V)) x 'Nekota' 1AL.1AS). These families were genotyped using the secalin-gliadin grain storage protein banding pattern generated with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to discriminate 1AL.1AS/1AL.1RS heterozygotes from the 1AL.1RS(A+V) and 1AL.1AS homozygotes. Segregation of the secalin locus and PCR markers based on the R173 family of rye specific repeated DNA sequences demonstrated the presence of recombinant 1AL.1RS(A+V) families. Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and greenbug resistance genes on the recombinant IRSA+V arm were mapped in relation to the Sec-1 locus, 2 additional protein bands, 3 SSRs, and 13 RFLP markers. The resultant linkage map of IRS spanned 82.4 cM with marker order and spacing showing reasonable agreement with previous maps of IRS. Fifteen markers lie within a region of 29.7 cM next to the centromere, yet corresponded to just 36% of the overall map length. The map position of the RFLP marker probe mwg68 was 10.9 cM distal to the Sec-1 locus and 7.8 cM proximal to the powdery mildew resistance locus. The greenbug resistance gene was located 2.7 cM proximal to the Sec-1 locus.

AB Rye is known for its high tolerance of aluminium in the soils in comparison with wheat and other cereals. To localize the major gene/genes controlling aluminium tolerance on the rye chromosomes, four series of wheat-rye addition lines, two sets of triticale D(R) substitution lines and several wheat/rye translocation lines were tested in experiments on seedlings grown in nutrient solutions with various concentrations of aluminium. The results indicate that the major locus responsible for Al tolerance in rye is located on the short arm of chromosome 3R. The importance of these results for controlled introgressions into cereals is discussed.

AB Specific oligonucleotide primers, designed for the sequences of known plant disease resistance genes, were used to amplify resistance gene analogues (RGAs) from wheat genomic DNA. This method was applied in a bulked segregant analysis to screen for the RGA markers linked to the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm31, introgressed into common wheat from wild emmer. Two RGA markers (RGA200 and RGA390) were found to be closely linked to Pm31 and completely co-segregating with the marker allele of Xpsp3029 linked to Pm31, with a genetic distance of 0.6 cM. These two RGA markers were then integrated into the formerly established microsatellite map of Pm31 region. The result showed the effectiveness of the RGA approach for developing molecular markers linked to disease resistance genes and demonstrated the efficiency of denaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis for detecting polymerase chain reaction polymorphism.

AB Fertile transgenic pearl millet plants expressing a phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) transgene under control of the maize ubiquitin constitutive promoter were obtained using the transformation system described here. Proliferating immature zygotic embryos were used as target tissue for bombardment using a particle inflow gun. Different culture and selection strategies were assessed in order to obtain an optimised mannose selection protocol. Stable integration of the manA gene into the genome of pearl millet was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Stable integration of the manA transgene into the genome of pearl millet was demonstrated in T-1 and T-2 progeny of two independent transformation events with no more than four to ten copies of the transgene. Similar to results obtained from previous studies with maize and wheat, the manA gene was shown to be a superior selectable marker gene for improving transformation efficiencies when compared to antibiotic or herbicide selectable marker genes.

AB Gametophytic apomixis is asexual reproduction as a consequence of parthenogenetic development of a chromosomally unreduced egg. The trait leads to the production of embryos with a maternal genotype, i.e. progeny are clones of the maternal plant. The application of the trait in agriculture could be a tremendous tool for crop improvement through conventional and nonconventional breeding methods. Unfortunately, there are no major crops that reproduce by apomixis, and interspecific hybridization with wild relatives has not yet resulted in commercially viable germplasm. Pennisetum squamulatum is an aposporous apomict from which the gene(s) for apomixis has been transferred to sexual pearl millet by backcrossing. Twelve molecular markers that are linked with apomixis coexist in a tight linkage block called the apospory-specific genomic region (ASGR), and several of these markers have been shown to be hemizygous in the polyploid genome of R squamulatum. High resolution genetic mapping of these markers has not been possible because of low recombination in this region of the genome. We now show the physical arrangement of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing apomixis-linked molecular markers by high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization on pachytene chromosomes. The size of the ASGR, currently defined as the entire hemizygous region that hybridizes with apomixis-linked bacterial artificial chromosomes, was estimated on pachytene and mitotic chromosomes to be approximately 50 Mbp (a quarter of the chromosome). The ASGR includes highly repetitive sequences from an Opie-2-like retrotransposon family that are particularly abundant in this region of the genome.

AB An advanced backcross population consisting of 80 BC3F3 lines derived from rice vars. Vandana/Moroberekan was analysed for blast resistance and genotyped with 50 candidate genes and 23 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Six candidate defence response genes [thaumatin, three nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat sequences from maize and two resistance gene analogue (RGA) markers] and one SSR marker (RM21) were significantly associated with partial blast resistance in rice (P=0.01). These markers accounted for phenotypic variation ranging from 9.6% to 29.4% and contributed to 76% of the total variation of percentage diseased leaf area (DLA) observed under natural infection. Four candidate genes (oxalate oxidase, 14-3-3 protein and two RGA markers) and four SSR markers (RM21, RM168, RM215 and RM250) were significantly associated with resistance to a single pathogen isolate, PO6-6. Among these, two markers were for DLA, five for lesion number and one for lesion size. These markers accounted for 9.1-28.7% of the phenotypic variation. A moderate correlation (r=0.48, P<0.01) was found between the level of partial resistance measured in the greenhouse and that measured under natural conditions. Analysis of BC3F4 progeny using genotypes of BC3F3 confirmed the phenotypic contribution of these markers. Cluster analysis of DNA profiles showed that the BC3 population was genetically similar (>85%) to the recurrent parent Vandana. Although no obvious relationship between DNA profiles and resistant phenotypes was observed, three lines (VM19, VM46 and VM76) in a cluster with high similarity to Vandana (89-96%) expressed a high level of partial blast resistance in the field. Analysis of disease progress in the field confirmed the performance of selected lines based on greenhouse and nursery analyses. The advanced backcross progeny with resistance phenotypes tagged by markers will be useful for accumulating blast resistance in upland rice.

AB It is reported that chromosome 1 R of rye (Secale cereale L.) convey phosphorus use efficient gene (s), and 1RS/1BL translocation genotype Lovrin No.10 is P use efficient. So we hypothesized whether P efficient gene(s) locate on 1RS, and the high P efficiency of Lovrin No. 10 is from 1RS? To test this hypothesis, we investigated the P use efficiency (PUE) of a doubled haploid (DH) population with 61 lines derived from anther culture of F, hybrid between Lovrin No.10 and phosphorus uptake inefficient genotype Chinese Spring to see whether PUE differs between DH line with and without 1RS/1BL translocation. Acidic polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) of gliadin and genomic DNA in situ hybridization (GISH) were employed to discriminate 1RS/1BL translocation DH lines from the normal 1B DH lines. Among the 61 DH lines investigated, A-PAGE analysis showed that 34 lines contained the 1RS/1BL translocation chromosome, which was characterized by the presence of a 1RS-specific Sec-1 marker bands. Further verification with GISH proved that 33 in the 34 lines contained a pair of homozygous 1RS/1BL translocation chromosomes, only one line was a 1RS/1BL monosomic line. A field experiment was carried out on P deficient soil to investigate grain yield, biomass, numbers of spikes per plant (SPP), P uptake efficiency (PUpE), and P utilization efficiency (PUtE) of the DH lines and their parents under -P (nil P applied) and +P (60 kg P/hm(2) applied) at maturity. Results showed soil P deficiency decreased the values of the first four traits in Lovrin No.10, but were more severe for Chinese Spring. Lovrin No.10 had higher values of all the above tested traits at both -P and +P than Chinese Spring did, but had similar PUtE with Chinese Spring. These five traits segregated, and differed greatly among DH lines under both -P and +P conditions. Although the variations among DH lines exceeded the difference between the two parents, the average values of the DH lines were between the two parents. The average of the above five traits, and P deficiency tolerance (PDT) (measured by relative grain yield of -P/+P) were not different between the DH lines with and without 1RS/1BL translocation. This indicated that there was no association between 1RS and PUE and PDT in Lovrin No.10, and 1RS may not have P efficient gene(s). Therefore, in the offspring of Lovrin No.10, it is possible to combine high PUE and PDT with good quality without the negative effect of 1RS on flour quality.

AB Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been widely used in the physical mapping of genes and chromosome landmarks in plants and animals. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) contain large inserts making them amenable for FISH mapping. We used BAC-FISH to study genome organization and evolution in hexaploid wheat and its relatives. We selected 56 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) locus-specific BAC clones from libraries of Aegilops tauschii (the D-genome donor of hexaploid wheat) and A-genome diploid Triticum monococcum. Different types of repetitive sequences were identified using BAC-FISH. Two BAC clones gave FISH patterns similar to the repetitive DNA family pSc119; one BAC clone gave a FISH pattern similar to the repetitive DNA family pAs1. In addition, we identified several novel classes of repetitive sequences: one BAC clone hybridized to the centromeric regions of wheat and other cereal species, except rice; one BAC clone hybridized to all subtelomeric chromosome regions in wheat, rye, barley and oat; one BAC clone contained a localized tandem repeat and hybridized to five D-genome chromosome pairs in wheat; and four BAC clones hybridized only to a proximal region in the long arm of chromosome 4A of hexaploid wheat. These repeats are valuable markers for defined chromosome regions and can also be used for chromosome identification. Sequencing results revealed that all these repeats are transposable elements (TEs), indicating the important role of TEs, especially retrotransposons, in genome evolution of wheat.

AB Improved bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars for diverse agroecological environments are important for success in the effort to increase food production. In the 1980s, CIMMYT introduced the megaenvironment (ME) concept to breed wheats specifically adapted to different areas. Our objective was to analyze the genetic diversity among 68 advanced CIMMYT wheat lines targeted to different MEs by using 99 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and the coefficient of parentage (COP). The average number of alleles detected was higher for the 47 genomic SSRs (5.4) than for the 52 SSRs derived from expressed sequence tags (EST) (3.3), but gene diversity between MEs was similar for both types of markers. No significant differences among the five MEs were observed for the means of SSR-based genetic similarities (GS), calculated as 1 - Rogers' distance, and COP values. Both measures showed a low correlation (r = 0.43). High levels of genetic diversity were found within the germplasm targeted to each ME. However, principle coordinate analysis based on modified Rogers' distances did not separate the genotypes according to their targeted MEs. We conclude that presence of a single core germplasm can reflect large phenotypic differences. A sufficient number of diverse breeding lines for each ME is required because MEs generally combine various production areas. SSRs represent a powerful tool to quantify genetic diversity in wheat, but genotypic differentiation for adaptation to specific MEs in the CIMMYT program could not be proven.

AB Genotype x environment interactions (GEI) and quantitative trait loci x environment interactions (QEI) are known to influence the expression of agronomic performance traits in wheat. The aim of this study was to provide biological and environmental explanations for large GEI and QEI known to affect the expression of genes on chromosome 3A of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Agronomic performance and molecular marker data available for a population of chromosome 3A recombinant inbred chromosome lines (RICLs-3A) in seven environments was used along with environmental covariate data to construct individual factorial regressions to explain GEI and QEI. Precipitation and temperature before anthesis had the greatest influence on agronomic performance traits for the RICLs-3A, and explained a sizeable portion of the total GEI for those traits. Individual molecular marker x environmental covariate interactions explained a large portion of the total marker x environment interactions for several agronomic traits. Seventy-six percent of the QEI for a major grain yield quantitative trait locus (QTL) was explained by the effect of temperature during preanthesis growth on dissimilar QTL genotype differentials across testing environments. Environmental covariates provided a strong basis for explaining QEI using marker x environmental covariate interactions.

AB In a prior study on the haplomes of wheat using the 5S rRNA gene (Baum ad Bailey 2001) we assigned the long A1 and short A1 unit classes to the A haplome in the diploid T. monococcum. The short A1 unit class is absent in the tetraploids T. turgidum and T. timopheevii and in the hexaploid T. aestivum, although present in the hexaploid T. zhukovskyi. Both T. turgidum and T. aestivum contained a different 5S DNA unit class labeled the short A2.
   The purpose of this paper was to study the short A2 units in the two diploid species to shed light on the theory that the A haplome donor of T. turgidum and T. aestivum was T. urartu. Fifty eight clones were obtained from 12 accessions, sequenced and analyzed. As expected T. baeoticum, which is often classified as a subspecies of T. monococcum, contained the long A1 and the short A1 5S DNA units. Unexpectedly, T. urartu had the long A1 and the short G1 unit classes instead and other units not found so far in Triticum. These findings support the hypothesis that the donor of the A genome in T. zhukovskyi was T. monococcum, as identified by the short A1 units. However, the short A1 units are absent in T. timopheevii, also a carrier of the A genome. The short G1 units found in T. urartu also identify it as a possible donor of the G genome to T. timopheevii. The short G1 units were also found in T. aestivum in our prior study. The long G1 unit class was not found in T. urartu but reported from T. timopheevii and T. zhukovskyi. The implications of these and related findings on the evolution of wheats are discussed.

AB Weedly rice has much stronger seed dormancy than cultivated rice. A wild-like weedy strain SS18-2 was selected to investigate the genetic architecture underlying seed dormancy, a critical adaptive trait in plants. A framework genetic map covering the rice genome was constructed on the basis of 156 BC1 [EM93-1 (nondormant breeding line)//EM93-1/SS18-2] individuals. The mapping population was replicated using a split-tiller technique to control and better estimate the environmental variation. Dormancy was determined by germination of seeds after 1, 11, and 21 clays of after-ripening (DAR). Six dormancy QTL, designated as qSD(S)-4, -6, -7-1, -7-2, -8, and -12, were identified. The locus qSD(S)-7-1 was tightly linked to the red pericarp color gene Rc. A QTL X DAR interaction was detected for qSD(S)-12, the locus with the largest main effect at 1, 11, and 21 DAR (R-2 = 0.14, 0.24, and 0.20, respectively). Two, three, and four orders of epistases were detected with four, six, and six QTL, respectively. The higher-order epistases strongly suggest the presence of genetically complex networks in the regulation of variation for seed dormancy in natural populations and make it critical to select for a favorable combination of alleles at multiple loci in positional cloning of a target dormancy gene.

AB In spite of commercial use of heterosis in agriculture, the molecular basis of heterosis is poorly understood. Improved differential display was used in this study to analyze alterations in gene expression between hybrid and parents in leaves at jointing stage and heading stage in a wheat diallel cross involving 20 hybrids and nine parents, with the purpose of determining the relationship of differential expression patterns with heterosis in nine agronomic traits. About 2800 fragments were displayed front each hybrid and its parents, among which about 30% were differentially expressed between hybrids and their parents. Four patterns of differential expression were observed: (i) fragments observed in both parents but not in F-1 (BPnF(1)); (ii) fragments that occurred in either of the parents but not in F-1 (UNF1); (iii) fragments observed only in F-1 but not in either of the parents (F(1)nBP); (iv) fragments present in one of the parents and F-1 (UPF1). UPnF(1) pattern is negatively correlated with heterosis in seven traits, while F(1)nBP pattern is positively correlated with heterosis in six traits, and UPF1 pattern is positively correlated with heterosis in three traits. BPnF(1) is not known yet, play an important role for hybrids to demonstrate heterosis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this research was to identify Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum)-Lophopyrum genetic lines that might complement FHB resistance in common wheat; and to identify DNA markers that can be used to tag the resistance gene in the alien chromatin (E or el(2) genome) for the development of improved wheat cultivars. FHB resistance was evaluated in 19 Chinese Spring-Lophopyrum elongatum (EE) substitution lines, two Thatcher-L. ponticum (el(1) and el(2)) substitution lines, and four Thatcher-L. ponticum translocation lines. Significant resistance was identified in the substitution lines 7E(7A), 7E(7B), and 7E(7D). The homoeologous chromosome, 7el(2),also showed resistance in the Thatcher genetic background. Both the Thatcher-7el(1) substitution and translocation lines were susceptible, like Thatcher, indicating that there is no resistance gene on the 7el(1) chromosome. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) in homoeologous group 7 chromosomes were used to identify DNA markers located on 7E and 7el(2). As expected, the transferability of wheat SSR markers to Lophopyrum is low. Of the 52 SSR markers that we tested, only five were found to be co-dominant on 7E of L. elongatum versus 7A, 7B, and 7D, one of which is also positive on 7el(2). A CAPS marker, derived from the RFLP probe PSR129, can serve as a dominant marker for 7el(2) chromatin.

AB A set of 41 wheat microsatellite markers (WMS), giving 42 polymorphic loci (two loci on each chromosome), was used to describe genetic diversity in a sample of 559 French bread wheat accessions (landraces and registered varieties) cultivated between 1800 and 2000. A total of 609 alleles were detected. Allele number per locus ranged from 3 to 28, with a mean allele number of 14.5. On the average, about 72% of the total number of alleles were observed with a frequency of less than 5% and were considered to be rare alleles. WMS markers used showed different levels of gene diversity: the highest PIC value occurred in the B genome (0.686) compared to 0.641 and 0.659 for the A and D genomes, respectively. When comparing landraces with registered varieties gathered in seven temporal groups, a cluster analysis based on an F-st matrix provided a clear separation of landraces from the seven variety groups, while a shift was observed between varieties registered before and after 1970. There was a decrease of about 25% in allelic richness between landraces and varieties. In contrast, when considering only registered varieties, changes in diversity related to temporal trends appeared more qualitative than quantitative, except at the end of the 1960s, when a bottleneck might have occurred. New varieties appear to be increasingly similar to each other in relation to allelic composition, while differences between landraces are more and more pronounced over time. Finally, considering a sub-sample of 193 varieties representative of breeding material selected during the twentieth century by the six most important plant breeding companies, few differences in diversity were observed between the different breeding programmes. The observed structure of diversity in French bread wheat collections is discussed in terms of consequences, both for plant breeders and for managers of crop genetic resources.

AB YrQz, a stripe rust disease resistance gene was identified in a common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L) line Qz180. This resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene, which was confirmed by genetic analysis of two F-2 populations derived from the crosses using Qz180 and two susceptible parents (Mingxian 169 and WL1). Bulked segregant analysis using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers was conducted in order to map the chromosomal location of YrQz. The results indicated that YrQz was located on the long arm of wheat chromosome 2B and resided in a region flanked by two SSR loci Xgwm388 and Xgwm526. Two AFLP markers P35M48(452) and P36M61 (163) were closely linked to YrQz with the genetic distance of 3.4 cM and 4.1 cM, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first molecularly mapped stripe rust resistance gene on wheat chromosome 2B.

AB We tested the importance of microenvironmental topographic parameters as predictors of emmer wheat genetic variation using three classes of single-locus (or at most several-loci) genetic markers (allozymes, glutenins, and qualitative traits) and two classes of markers of polygenic inheritance (phenological and morphological traits). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) detected a significant effect of spatially structured environmental variation on genetic differences between plants for allozymes, glutenins, and quantitative morphological and phenological traits. However, after removing a spatial component of variation in partial CCA and partial RDA, the relationship of the remaining environmental variation with these genetic markers could be explained by chance alone, allowing us to rule out microniche topographic specialization in emmer wheat. Topographic autocorrelation exhibited a certain degree of similarity with genetic marker auto-correlation, indicating similar scales of environmental heterogeneity and seed flow. The detected population genetic structure agrees with one expected under isolation by distance as a result of limited gene flow. A negative relationship of genetic similarity with the logarithm of distance between plants was detected for both molecular markers and quantitative traits, which differed in the strength but not the pattern of association.

AB In hexaploid crops, such as bread wheat, it should be possible to fine-tune phenotypic traits by identifying wild type and null genes from each of the three genomes and combining them in a calculated manner. Here, we demonstrate this with gene combinations for two starch synthesis genes, SSIIa and GBSSI. Lines with inactive copies of both enzymes show a very dramatic change in phenotype, so to create intermediate phenotypes, we used marker-assisted selection to develop near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying homozygous combinations of null alleles. For both genes, gene dosage effects follow the order B > D >= A; therefore, we completed detailed analysis of starch characteristics for NIL 3-3, which is null for the B-genome copy of the SSIIa and GBSSI genes, and NIL 5-5, which has null mutations in the B- and D-genome-encoded copies of both of these genes. The effects of the combinations on phenotypic traits followed the order expected on the basis of genotype, with NIL 5-5 showing the largest differences from the wild type, while NIL 3-3 characteristics were intermediate between NIL 5-5 and the wild type. Differences among genotypes were significant for many starch characteristics, including percent amylose, chain length distribution, gelatinization temperature, retrogradation, and pasting properties, and these differences appeared to translate into improvements in end-product quality, since bread made from type 5-5 flour showed a 3 day lag in staling,

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most widespread diseases in common wheat globally. The Chinese wheat cultivar Zhoumai 22 is highly resistant to leaf rust at the seedling and adult stages. Seedlings of Zhoumai 22 and 36 lines with known leaf rust resistance genes were inoculated with 13 P. triticina races for gene postulation. The leaf rust response of Zhoumai 22 was different from those of the single gene lines. With the objective of identifying and mapping, the new gene(s) for resistance to leaf rust, F-1, F-2 plants and F-2:3 lines from the cross Zhoumai 22/Chinese Spring were inoculated with Chinese P. triticina race FHDQ at the seedling stage. A single dominant gene, tentatively designated LrZH22, conferred resistance. To identify other possible genes in Zhoumai 22, ten P. triticina races avirulent on Zhoumai 22 were used to inoculate 24 F2: 3 lines. The same gene conferred resistance to all ten avirulent races. A total of 1300 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 36 EST markers on 2BS were used to test the parents, and resistant and susceptible bulks. Resistance gene LrZH22 was mapped in the chromosome bin 2BS1-0.53-0.75 and closely linked to six SSR markers (barc183, barc55, gwm148, gwm410, gwm374 and wmc474) and two EST markers (BF202681 and BE499478) on chromosome arm 2BS. The two closest flanking SSR loci were Xbarc55 and Xgwm374 with genetic distances of 2.4 and 4.8 cM from LrZH22, respectively. Six designated genes (Lr13, Lr16, Lr23, Lr35, Lr48 and Lr73) are located on chromosome arm 2BS. In seedling tests, LrZH22 was temperature sensitive, conferring resistance at high temperatures. The reaction pattern of Zhoumai 22 was different from that of RL 4031 (Lr13), RL 6005 (Lr16) and RL 6012 (Lr23), Lr35 and Lr48 are adult-plant resistance genes, and Lr73 is not sensitive to the temperature. Therefore, LrZH22 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene or allele.

AB Leaf, stripe and stem rust are considered one of the most important diseases of wheat in Pakistan. The use of rust resistant varieties is the most economical and environment friendly way to reduce losses due to rust diseases. For this purpose a study was planned to combine genes for enhancing rust resistance and high yield potential in wheat. The experiments for identification of durable rust resistance genes i.e. Sr2/Yr30, Lr34/Yr18, Lr46/Yr29 on the basis of phenotypic markers like pseudo black chaff (Pbc) and leaf tip necrosis (Ltn1 & Ltn2) were conducted in augmented design during the years 2010-11 and 2011-12 at Wheat Research Institute, Faisalabad and Summar Agricultural Research Station, Kaghan. Total 750 head rows were selected from F6 generation and planted at SARS, Kaghan. The outstanding 345 lines were selected and planted for further evaluation and on the basis of rust reactions, phenotypic uniformity and high yield under the field conditions, 220 lines were selected for further testing. The results indicate that among 220 entries, 67 entries showed Lr34/Yr18, 23 entries showed Lr46/Yr29 and 62 entries showed Sr2/Yr30 genes combination. While in yield testing, among test entries, 99 entries were found to be high yielding ranging from 3973-4786 kg/ha. From the study, it is concluded that fourteen test entries i.e. V-11211, V-11212, V-11218, V-11227, V-11262, V-11288, V-11296, V-11304, V-11308, V-11319, V-11338, V-11353, V-11365 and V-11396 are the most prominent lines because these lines showed the combination of all three slow rusting genes as well as high yield potential. These selected genotypes will be very useful for the wheat breeders and pathologist of the country in planning of future hybridization program.

AB Sorghum is one of the world's most important food, feed, and fiber crops as well as a potential feedstock for lignocellulosic bioenergy. Early-season planting extends sorghum's growing season and increases yield in temperate regions. However, sorghum's sensitivity to low soil temperatures adversely impacts seed germination. In this study, we evaluated the 242 accessions of the ICRISAT sorghum mini core collection for seed germination and seedling vigor at 12 degrees C as a measure of cold tolerance. Genome-wide association analysis was performed with approximately 162 177 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Only one marker locus (Locus 7-2) was significantly associated with low-temperature germination and none with vigor. The linkage of Locus 7-2 to low-temperature germination was supported by four lines of evidence: strong association in three independent experiments, co-localization with previously mapped cold tolerance quantitative trait loci (QTL) in sorghum, a candidate gene that increases cold tolerance and germination rate when its wheat homolog is overexpressed in tobacco, and its syntenic region in rice co-localized with two cold tolerance QTL in rice. This locus may be useful in developing tools for molecular breeding of sorghums with improved low-temperature germinability.

AB The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is the most important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. subsp. aestivum) in the southeastern United States, and the deployment of genetically resistant wheat is the most effective control. However, the use of resistant wheat results in the selection of pest genotypes that can overcome formerly resistant wheat. We have evaluated the effectiveness of 16 resistance genes for protection of wheat from Hessian fly infestation in the southeastern United States. Results documented that while 10 of the genes evaluated could provide protection of wheat, the most highly effective genes were H12, H18, H24, H25, H26, and H33. However, H12 and H18 have been reported to be only partially effective in field evaluations, and H24, H25, and H26 may be associated with undesirable effects on agronomic traits when introgressed into elite wheat lines. Thus, the most promising new gene for Hessian fly resistance appears to be H33. These results indicate that identified highly effective resistance in wheat to the Hessian fly is a limited resource and emphasize the need to identify novel sources of resistance. Also, we recommend that the deployment of resistance in gene pyramids and the development of novel strategies for engineered resistance be considered.

AB Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, frequently produces new races overcoming resistance in wheat cultivars. A recently identified race, V26 with virulence to Yr26 and many other stripe rust resistance genes, has a high potential to cause epidemics in China. In this study, teliospores from a single-urediniospore isolate of V26 (Pinglan 17-7) produced on the wheat line 92R137 (Yr26) were used to produce a sexual population through selling by infecting Berberis shensiana plants under controlled conditions. One hundred and eighteen progeny isolates and the parental isolate were phenotyped for virulence/avirulence on 24 Yr gene lines of wheat. These progeny isolates were all avirulent to Yr5, Yr8, Yr15, and YrTr1 and virulent to Yr1, Yr2, Yr7, Yr9, Yr10, Yr17, Yr24, Yr25, Yr26, YrA, YrExp2, and YrV23, indicating that the parental isolate is homozygous avirulent or homozygous virulent at these loci. The progeny population segregated for avirulence to Yr6, Yr43, and YrSP at one locus (3 avirulent:1 virulent ratio); for virulence to Yr27 and Yr28 at one locus (3 virulent:1 avirulent); and for Yr4, Yr32, and Yr44 at two loci (15 virulent:1 avirulent). Among the eight segregating avirulence/virulence loci, association was found between virulence to Yr4 and Yr32, as well as between virulence to Yr6 and Yr43 based on chi(2) tests. From 82 genotypically different progeny isolates, 24 pathotypes and 82 multi locus genotypes were identified. The results show that a highly diverse population can be produced from a single isolate by selfing on a barberry plant and sexually produced population can be used to genetically characterize virulence of the stripe rust pathogen.

AB Wheat breeders worldwide are seeking new sources of resistance to Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. To prioritize field-resistant landraces for follow-up genetic studies to test for the presence of new resistance genes, seedling response to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK, molecular markers linked to specific Sr genes, segregation ratios among progeny from crosses, and bulked segregant analyses (BSA) were used. In total, 33 spring wheat landraces with seedling resistance to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK were crossed to a susceptible genotype, LMPG-6. The segregation ratios of stem rust reactions in F-2 seedlings fit a single dominant gene model in 31 populations and progeny from two crosses gave ambiguous results. Using the 90K wheat single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping platform, BSA showed that the seedling resistance in 29 accessions is probably controlled by loci on chromosome 2BL. For the three remaining accessions, BSA revealed that the seedling resistance is most likely controlled by previously unreported genes. For confirmation, two populations were advanced to the F-2:3 and screened against P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. Segregation of the F-2:3 families fit a 1:2:1 ratio for a single dominant gene. Using the F-2:3 families, BSA located the TTKSK locus on chromosome 6DS to the same location as Sr42.

AB Heterodera avenae is a cereal cyst nematode that reduces wheat yields in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Barley is also susceptible but there were no previous reports of resistance or tolerance to H. avenae in the United States. Spring barley cultivars were assayed in H. avenae-infested fields over 2 years. Cultivars were planted in plots treated or not treated with aldicarb. Forty-five cultivars were evaluated for the market classes of two- and six-row feed barley cultivars and two- and six-row malt barley cultivars. One two-row feed barley ('Lenetah') was ranked as resistant and four were tolerant or very tolerant. In total, 1 two-row malt barley ('Odyssey') was very resistant and 10 were tolerant or very tolerant. Two six-row feed and two six row malt barley cultivars were tolerant or very tolerant but none were resistant. Seven feed barley cultivars were ranked as having a balance of at least moderate resistance plus moderate tolerance: 'Champion', Lenetah, 'Xena', 'Idagold II', 'Transit', 'Millennium', and 'Golden eye'. This is the first report of resistance and tolerance of barley in H. avenae-infested fields in the Pacific Northwest. Barley productivity can be improved by planting resistant plus tolerant cultivars or by using highly resistant and highly tolerant cultivars as parents in barley improvement programs.

AB The barley grass stripe rust (BGYR) pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. pseudohordei was first detected in Australia in 1997. While studies have established that it is virulent on wild barley grass, and can infect several barley cultivars, the basis of genetic resistance to this pathogen in barley is largely unknown. Understanding the genetic basis of host resistance and ensuring the selection of germplasm with multiple resistance genes are important to mitigate the potential impact of BGYR in barley production. Genetic analysis of seedling resistance to BGYR in two barley doubled haploid populations, Amaji Nijo/WI2585 (AN/WI) and Galleon/Haruna Nijo (GL/HN), indicated that resistance is governed by several genes. Marker regression analysis of the seedling resistance data from the AN/WI population detected a major QTL, BGYR_WI1 (resistance contributed by WI2585 with the closest marker explaining 52 % of the total phenotypic effect) on chromosome 1HS, flanked by the loci Xabg59 and Xabc310b at map positions 0.0 and 6.9 cM, respectively. Similarly, a major QTL, BGYR_HN1, (resistance contributed by Haruna Nijo with the closest marker explaining 70 % of the total phenotypic effect) was detected in the GL/HN population and was mapped to 1HS, flanked by the loci Xbcd135 and XHOR1 at map positions 12.8 and 24.5 cM, respectively. In addition, several minor loci that provided resistance against BGYR were detected in both populations. While defined QTL intervals were large, the analysis nonetheless provides new information on sources of major QTL controlling resistance to BGYR.

AB The genes controlling earliness of plants include genes responsible for vernalisation (Vrn) and photoperiod (Ppd), and those that are not entirely associated with a response to temperature or light. The last group of loci is known as earliness per se (Eps). Eps genes have been most commonly reported in the scientific literature as quantitative trait loci (QTL). The objective of this study was to use a bidirectional selective genotyping (BSG) method for the identification of loci controlling Eps, assessed at the heading stage in a newly developed rye population of recombinant inbred lines. We identified four linkage groups representing fragments of chromosomes, 1R, 5R, 6R and 7R, and containing, in total, 155 DArT markers significantly associated with earliness in rye. The results are discussed in the context of previously published QTL analyses.

AB Limited remobilization of Zn from vegetative tissues into grains via phloem is a major physiological barrier against Zn loading into cereal grains. In present experiment, doubled-haploid mapping population (150 lines, derived from Clipper xSahara) of barley was genetically characterized for differential Zn remobilization.
   The germplasm was grown under glasshouse conditions. Leaves (upper three), stem (the rest of the plant) and mature grains were sampled from the main-tillers at anthesis and maturity for Zn analysis. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulating time to anthesis, plant biomass, Zn concentration in vegetative tissues and remobilization of Zn from these tissues into grains were identified using a genetic linkage map of 485 markers.
   A significant variation existed in grain Zn concentration among the lines (27-75 mu g Zn g(-1)), and it correlated with the amount of Zn remobilized from vegetative tissues into grains. Sahara remobilized 37 % of pre-anthesis Zn reserves into grains; the presence of its alleles at all QTL associated with leaf (3 QTL) and stem (2 QTL) Zn remobilization increased the trait score.
   Present study provided an insight into the genetic basis of Zn remobilization from vegetative tissues into barley grains. Such information is useful in breeding for Zn biofortification.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), is an important pest of small-grain cereals, particularly wheat, worldwide. The most efficient strategy against the RWA is to identify sources of resistance and to introduce them into susceptible wheat genotypes. This study was conducted to determine the mode of inheritance of the RWA resistance found in ICARDA accession IG 100695, to identify wheat microsatellite markers closely linked to the gene and to map the chromosomal location of the gene. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker scores were identified in a mapping population of 190F(2) individuals and compared, while phenotypic screening for resistance was performed in F-2:3 families derived from a cross between Basribey' (susceptible) and IG 100695 (resistant). Phenotypic segregation of leaf chlorosis and rolling displayed the effect of a single dominant gene, temporarily denoted Dn100695, in IG 100695. Dn100695 was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 7D with four linked SSR markers, Xgwm44, Xcfd14, Xcfd46 and Xbarc126. Dn100695 and linked SSR markers may be useful for improving resistance for RWA in wheat breeding.

AB Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is a destructive pathogen in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Host resistance is the most effective way to control this virus. To date, Wsm2 is the only wheat resistance gene that is genetically mapped. The objective of this study was to identify germplasm lines that might carry resistance genes different from Wsm2. Eight newly reported resistant germplasm lines were examined by allelic tests. To validate the allelic test results, five of them were further analysed for the inheritance of WSMV resistance. A Wsm2-linked marker was also genotyped on populations developed for the inheritance study. Our results suggested that the WSMV resistance in lines CItr9358, PI225288, PI243652, PI245439, PI245526 and PI478095 was controlled by either Wsm2 or a gene very closely linked to Wsm2. The resistance in PI243753 and PI321730, however, is likely controlled by a gene different from, but linked to Wsm2. The resistance in PI321730 might also involve some minor genes. This study provided useful information for breeders to select appropriate resistant lines to improve WSMV resistance in wheat.

AB Key message Breeding for field resistance to common bunt in wheat will need to account for multiple genes and epistatic and QTL by environment interactions. Loci associated with quantitative resistance to common bunt are co-localized with other beneficial traits including plant height and rust resistance.
   Common bunt, also known as stinking smut, is caused by seed borne fungi Tilletia tritici (Bjerk.) Wint. [syn. Tilletia caries (DC.) Tul.] and Tilletia laevis Kuhn [syn. Tilletia foetida (Wallr.) Liro.]. Common bunt is known to cause grain yield and quality losses in wheat due to bunt ball formation and infestation of the grain. The objectives of this research were to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for common bunt resistance, to study the epistatic interactions between the identified QTL, and investigate the co-localization of bunt resistance with plant height. A population of 261 doubled haploid lines from the cross Carberry/AC Cadillac and checks were genotyped with polymorphic genome wide microsatellite and DArTA (R) markers. The lines were grown in 2011, 2012, and 2013 in separate nurseries for common bunt incidence and height evaluation. AC Cadillac contributed a QTL (QCbt.spa-6D) for common bunt resistance on chromosome 6D at markers XwPt-1695, XwPt-672044, and XwPt-5114. Carberry contributed QTL for bunt resistance on chromosomes 1B (QCbt.spa-1B at XwPt743523) 4B (QCbt.spa-4B at XwPt-744434-Xwmc617), 4D (QCbt.spa-4D at XwPt-9747), 5B (QCbt.spa-5B at XtPt-3719) and 7D (QCbt.spa-7D at Xwmc273). Significant epistatic interactions were identified for percent bunt incidence between QCbt.spa-1B x QCbt.spa-4B and QCbt.spa-1B x QCbt.spa-6D, and QTL by environment interaction between QCbt.spa-1B x QCbt.spa-6D. Plant height QTL were found on chromosomes 4B (QPh.spa-4B) and 6D (QPh.spa-6D) that co-located with bunt resistance QTL. The identification of previously unreported common bunt resistance QTL (on chromosomes 4B, 4D and 7D), and new understanding of QTL x QTL interactions will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for common bunt resistance.

AB Key message Rphq2 , a minor gene for partial resistance to Puccinia hordei , was physically mapped in a 188 kbp introgression with suppressed recombination between haplotypes of rphq2 and Rphq2 barley cultivars.
   Partial and non-host resistances to rust fungi in barley (Hordeum vulgare) may be based on pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity. Understanding partial resistance may help to understand non-host resistance, and vice versa. We constructed two non-gridded BAC libraries from cultivar Vada and line SusPtrit. Vada is immune to non-adapted Puccinia rust fungi, and partially resistant to P. hordei. SusPtrit is susceptible to several non-adapted rust fungi, and has been used for mapping QTLs for non-host and partial resistance. The BAC libraries help to identify genes determining the natural variation for partial and non-host resistances of barley to rust fungi. A major-effect QTL, Rphq2, for partial resistance to P. hordei was mapped in a complete Vada and an incomplete SusPtrit contig. The physical distance between the markers flanking Rphq2 was 195 Kbp in Vada and at least 226 Kbp in SusPtrit. This marker interval was predicted to contain 12 genes in either accession, of which only five genes were in common. The haplotypes represented by Vada and SusPtrit were found in 57 and 43 %, respectively, of a 194 barley accessions panel. The lack of homology between the two haplotypes probably explains the suppression of recombination in the Rphq2 area and limit further genetic resolution in fine mapping. The possible candidate genes for Rphq2 encode peroxidases, kinases and a member of seven-in-absentia protein family. This result suggests that Rphq2 does not belong to the NB-LRR gene family and does not resemble any of the partial resistance genes cloned previously.

AB Key message The wheat ortholog of the rice gene OsXA21 against bacterial leaf blight showed resistance to multiple pests in bread wheat but different interacting proteins.
   A quantitative trait locus QYr.osu-5A on the long arm of chromosome 5A in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD) was previously reported to confer consistent resistance in adult plants to predominant stripe rust races, but the gene causing the quantitative trait locus (QTL) is not known. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to saturate the QTL region. Comparative and syntenic regions between wheat and rice (Oryza sativa) were applied to identify candidate genes for QYr.osu-5A. TaXA21-A1, which is referred to as a wheat ortholog of OsXA21-like gene on chromosome 9 in rice, was mapped under the peak of the QYr.osu-5A. TaXA21-A1 not only explained the phenotypic variation in reaction to different stripe rust races but also showed significant effects on resistance to powdery mildew and Hessian fly biotype BP. The natural allelic variation resulted in the alternations of four amino acids in deduced TaXA21-A1 proteins. The interacting proteins of TaXA21-A1 were different from those identified by OsXA21 on rice chromosome 11 against bacterial leaf blight. TaXA21-A1 confers unique resistance against multiple pests in wheat but might not have common protein interactors or thus overlapping functions with OsXA21 in rice. XA21 function has diverged during evolution of cereal crops. The molecular marker developed for TaXA21-A1 would accelerate its application of the candidate gene at the QYr.osu-5A locus in wheat breeding programs.

AB Key message YrSM139-1B maybe a new gene for effective resistance to stripe rust and useful flanking markers for marker-assisted selection were developed.
   Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat. Two dominant stripe rust resistant genes YrSM139-1B and YrSM139-2D were pyramided in bread wheat cultivar Shaanmai 139; one from wild emmer and the other from Thinopyrum intermedium. Three near-isogenic F-7:8 line pairs (contrasting RILs), N122-1013R/S, N122-185R/S, and N122-1812R/S, independently derived from different F-2 plants and differing at the YrSM139-1B locus were generated from the cross Shaanmai 139 x Hu 901-19 through marker-assisted selection. A large F-2:3 population from cross N122-1013R x N122-1013S tested for stripe rust response and subjected to analysis with markers in the 1BS10-0.5 bin region using SSR expressed sequence tags (EST) and site-specific sequence markers developed from the 90 K Illumina iSelect SNP array. Five EST-STS markers and four allele-specific PCR markers were mapped to the YrSM139-1B region. The 30.5 cM genetic map for YrSM139-1B consisted of nine markers, two of which were closer to YrSM139-1B than Xgwm273, which was used in producing the contrasting RIL pairs. Race response data and allelism tests showed that YrSM139-1B is different from Yr10, Yr15, and Yr24/26/CH42.

AB Key message Hard red wheats can donate genes to hard white wheats for tolerance to preharvest sprouting, the effects are quantitative in nature, and may be tracked with previously described DNA markers.
   Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can negatively impact end-use quality and seed viability at planting. Due to preferences for white over red wheat in international markets, white wheat with PHS tolerance has become increasingly desired for worldwide wheat production. In general, however, red wheat is more tolerant of sprouting than white wheat. The main objective of this study was the identification of PHS tolerance conditioned by genes donated from hard red winter wheat, using markers applicable to the Great Plains hard white wheat gene pool. Three red wheat by white wheat populations, Niobrara/NW99L7068, NE98466/NW99L7068 and Jagalene/NW99L7068 were developed, and white-seeded progenies were analyzed for PHS tolerance and used to identify markers for the trait. In the three populations, marker loci with significant allelic effects were most commonly located on chromosomes of group 2, 3, 4 and 5, though additional markers were detected across the wheat genome. Chromosome 3A was the only chromosome with significant markers in all three populations. Markers were inconsistent across the three populations, and markers linked to tolerance-inducing loci were identified in both tolerant and susceptible parents. Additive effects of marker loci were common. In the present investigation, a wide range of PHS tolerance was observed, even though all lines were fixed for the recently reported positive TaPHS1 allele. PHS tolerance is controlled by additive major gene effects with minor gene effects where variations of minor gene effects were still unclear.

AB Although bioassay approaches are useful for identifying chemicals of potential concern, they provide little understanding of the mechanisms of chemical toxicity. Without this understanding, it is difficult to address some of the key challenges that currently face aquatic ecotoxicology. To overcome this, the toxicity potential of the water samples was assessed and surviving organisms (Physa acuta) were used for protein activity measurements and gene expression profiling by making use of complementary DNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) analysis. From the data it was evident that the impacts of specific pollutants (e.g. sewage) on organisms at the cellular level could be identified, and that the expressed stressor genes can be used as bioindicators/markers/genetic signatures or fingerprints during identification of point source pollution. From an ecosystem management point of view these insights could assist with the forecasting and reduction of environmental risks on catchment level by implementing suitable management interventions.

AB Leaves of many angiosperm species develop trichomes. These epidermal outgrowths have been exploited to the study the determination of cell fate, plant cell differentiation mechanisms and cell morphogenesis in the model plant species. It was found that even simple shape trichomes (leaf hairs) offer protection against both biotic and abiotic stress factors. Currently, in monocotyledonous plants, the genetic basis of leaf hair formation is poorly understood. This study sought to establish the genetic control of leaf pubescence formation in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in terms of leaf hair patterning and growth. A set of cultivars and lines carrying allelic combinations of three pubescence controlling genes, Hl1, Hl3 and Hl2 (aesp) was used for quantitative phenotyping. It was demonstrated that these genes differ in their effect on leaf hair formation: Hl1 and Hl3 more affected leaf hair initiation and growth, while Hl2 (aesp) modified leaf hair length. Their action was independent to a large extent. A model of Hl1, Hl3 and Hl2 (aesp) genes action is proposed.

AB Tan spot, a major foliar disease of wheat, is caused by an ascomycete Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (PTR). Association mapping on germplasm collection is a novel approach for the discovery and validation of major genes/QTLs for a trait. Linkage disequilibrium, the genetic basis of association mapping, can be an important tool to identify genomic regions associated with tan spot resistance. Association analysis utilizing the population structure and additive genetic covariance between relatives was conducted for tan spot resistance on a set of historical bread wheat germplasm comprising of 170 lines developed at CIMMYT, Mexico with the genotypic data generated with 1644 molecular markers. Tan spot resistance data was obtained by screening the germplasm with PTR race 1 isolate Ptr-1. Two weeks old seedlings were inoculated and rated 8 days later on a lesion type disease scale. Three experiments were conducted in the greenhouse with each experiment as arranged in completely randomized design with two replicates. Over half of the entries were resistant to tan spot induced by PTR race 1. The genome-wide scan revealed significant marker-phenotype associations on the short arm of chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 6B and long arm of chromosomes 4A, 6A(1), 6A(2), 2B, 3B, 5B, and 7B that play an important role in conferring resistance to tan spot. Although some genomic regions contributing to tan spot resistance have been previously identified; novel regions on long arm of chromosomes 6A(1), 6A(2), and 7B, were identified in this study. Findings of this study reveal that a high proportion of CIMMYT wheat germplasm is resistant to tan spot caused by PTR race 1 and genetic base of CIMMYT germplasm resistance involves race specific and non-race specific resistance genes.

AB To determine if Chinese and Japanese wheat landraces and varieties have unique sources of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance, an association mapping panel of 195 wheat accessions including both commercial varieties and landraces was genotyped with 364 genome-wide simple sequence repeat and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, and evaluated for type II FHB resistance in three greenhouse experiments using single floret inoculation. Population structure analysis stratified this population into five groups with Chinese landraces in four groups. Thirty-two of 51 Chinese landraces and 24 of 27 Japanese accessions were placed in one group. Association analysis using a mixed model identified 11 markers having significant associations with FHB resistance in at least two experiments. Most of these markers coincided with known quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance with one potentially novel QTL associated with Xgdm138-5DS and Xgwm358-5DS. Xbarc19-3AS was significant in all three experiments, and the frequency of favorable alleles was more than 53 %. Chinese landraces and Japanese accessions had more favorable alleles at the majority of reproducible marker loci. Nine QTL combinations were identified according to the number of favorable alleles. Mean FHB severities increased with decreasing numbers of favorable alleles at reproducible loci. The resistance loci characterized here will further diversify the wheat FHB resistance gene pool, and provide breeders with additional sources of resistance for improvement of FHB resistance in wheat.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe causes devastating losses in wheat globally. 'Truman' winter wheat, developed and released by the University of Missouri has excellent broad-based FHB resistance in a superior soft red winter wheat background. This research identified QTL associated with greenhouse type II resistance and field resistance for incidence, severity, Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK), and deoxynivalenol (DON) based on phenotypic data collected in Missouri, Kentucky and Indiana. Two years of replicated phenotypic data were collected on a set of 167 recombinant inbred lines. Genetic linkage maps were constructed using 160 SSR and 530 DArT polymorphic markers. Across years, QTL for type II resistance were identified on chromosomes 1BSc, 2BL, 2DS and 3BSc, for incidence on 2ASc, 2DS, and 3DS and for severity on 2DS and 3BSc. QTL were also detected for incidence on 1DLc and 2DS and for severity on 1BL, 3AL and 3BLC from data collected in Indiana and Kentucky, respectively. Common QTL for FDK on chromosomes 2ASc and 3BLc and for DON on chromosomes 2ASc and 2DS were identified from data from both Missouri and Kentucky, respectively with additional individual QTL for FDK and DON identified from tests at each independent location. All alleles were from Truman and associated with significant reductions in the respective traits. QTL on 2ASC, 2DS and 3DS may be novel and once further validated, should diversify the FHB gene pool globally and be useful for enhancing FHB resistance through marker assisted selection.

AB Background: Variability of heading date may assist in wheat adaptation to local environments. Thereafter, discovery of new heading date determinants is important for cereal improvement. In this study we used common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) and the substitution line of CS with 5B chromosome from T. dicoccoides (CS-5Bdic), different in their heading date by two weeks, to detect determinants of heading date on 5B chromosome.
   Results: The possible influence of the VRN-B1 gene, the most powerful regulator of flowering, located on 5B chromosome, to differences in heading time between CS and CS-5Bdic was studied. The sequencing of this gene from CS-5Bdic showed that an insertion of a nucleotide triplet produced an additional amino acid in the corresponding protein. No changes in the transcription levels of each homoeologous VRN-1 loci were found in CS-5Bdic by comparison with CS. To ascertain the loci determining heading date difference, a set of 116 recombinant inbred 5. chromosomal lines as a result of hybridization of CS with CS-5Bdic were developed and their heading dates were estimated. Using the Illumina Infinium 15 k Wheat platform, 379 5B-specific polymorphic markers were detected and a genetic map with 82 skeletal markers was constructed. Phenotype (heading date)-genotype association analysis revealed seventy eight markers in pericentromeric region of 5B chromosome significantly associated with heading date variation. Based on this estimation and synteny with model crop genomes we identified the three best candidate genes: WRKY, ERF/AP2 and FHY3/FAR1.
   Conclusions: We supposed that the difference in activity of WRKY, ERF/AP2 and/or FHY3/FAR1 transcription factors between CS and CS-5Bdic to be a probable reason for the observed difference in heading dates. Data obtained in this study provide a good basis for the subsequent investigation of heading time pathways in wheat.

AB Soil salinity is a limiting factor of crop yield. The soybean is sensitive to soil salinity, and a dominant gene, Glyma03g32900 is primarily responsible for salt-tolerance. The identification of high throughput and robust markers as well as the deployment of salt-tolerant cultivars are effective approaches to minimize yield loss under saline conditions. We utilized high quality (15x) whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) on 106 diverse soybean lines and identified three major structural variants and allelic variation in the promoter and genic regions of the GmCHX1 gene. The discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with structural variants facilitated the design of six KASPar assays. Additionally, haplotype analysis and pedigree tracking of 93 U.S. ancestral lines were performed using publically available WGRS datasets. Identified SNP markers were validated, and a strong correlation was observed between the genotype and salt treatment phenotype (leaf scorch, chlorophyll content and Na+ accumulation) using a panel of 104 soybean lines and, an interspecific bi-parental population (F-8) from PI483463 x Hutcheson. These markers precisely identified salt-tolerant/sensitive genotypes (>91%), and different structural-variants (>98%). These SNP assays, supported by accurate phenotyping, haplotype analyses and pedigree tracking information, will accelerate marker-assisted selection programs to enhance the development of salt-tolerant soybean cultivars.

AB High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are important seed storage proteins in wheat (Triticum aestivum) that determine wheat dough elasticity and processing quality. Clarification of the defined effectiveness of HMW-GSs is very important to breeding efforts aimed at improving wheat quality. To date, there have no report on the expression silencing and quality effects of 1Bx20 and 1By20 at the Glu-B1 locus in wheat. A wheat somatic variation line, AS208, in which both 1Bx20 and 1By20 at Glu-B1 locus were silenced, was developed recently in our laboratory. Evaluation of agronomic traits and seed storage proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) indicated that AS208 was highly similar to its parental cultivar Lunxuan987 (LX987), with the exception that the composition and expression of HMW-GSs was altered. The 1Bx20 and 1By20 in AS208 were further identified to be missing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Based on the PCR results for HMW-GS genes and their promoters in AS208 compared with LX987, 1Bx20 and 1By20 were speculated to be deleted in AS208 during in vitro culture. Quality analysis of this line with Mixograph, Farinograph, and Extensograph instruments, as well as analysis of bread-making quality traits, demonstrated that the lack of the genes encoding 1Bx20 and 1By20 caused various negative effects on dough processing and bread-making quality traits, including falling number, dough stability time, mixing tolerance index, crude protein values, wet gluten content, bread size, and internal cell structure. AS208 can potentially be used in the functional dissection of other HMW-GSs as a plant material with desirable genetic background, and in biscuit making industry as a high-quality weak gluten wheat source.

AB Littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.) is one of the most common and troublesome weeds infesting wheat crop in India. Repeated use during the last two decades of the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide (clodinafop) to control this weed has resulted in the occurrence of resistance. Fifty-three P. minor populations were collected from wheat fields in Haryana and Punjab states of India. The dose-response assays indicated that 29 populations were resistant, 23 populations were susceptible and one population was moderately resistant to clodinafop. Sequence analysis of the CT domain of ACCase gene among resistant and susceptible populations revealed two non-synonymous mutations, Trp(2027) to Cys and Ile(2041) to Asn in the resistant populations. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed to differentiate between wild-type and resistant codons at positions 2027 and 2041 of ACCase in P. minor which enables molecular assays for rapid detection and resistance diagnosis for efficient weed management in wheat. This is the first report from India of a target site mutation corresponding to resistance to clodinafop in P. minor.

AB The study of reliability of morphological characterization of lightsprouts for differentiation of potato varieties was performed at the Agricultural Institute of Slovenia in cooperation with Biotechnical Faculty Podgorica in order to introduce simple method for further characterization of potato accessions in Montenegrin gene bank. Seven selected, potentially different, potato accessions preserved in the Montenegrin gene bank were used for morphological characterization of lightsprouts. Using UPOV guidelines 11 lightsprout traits were estimated. Molecular assessment was carried out in parallel with morphological characterization by six microsatellite (SSR) markers. The latter successfully distinguished all accessions but two, while four different lightsprout phenotypes were identified in morphological characterization. Though molecular markers showed more strength in resolving relationships between genotypes, characterization of lightsprouts still demonstrated its usefulness due to cheap, simple and rapid procedure.

AB An optimum heading date is essential for sustainable crop productivity and ensuring high yields. In the present study, F-2:3, populations were generated by crossing an early-heading accession, Y2280, with a late-heading accession, Y2282. The heading dates of the F-2 and F-3 populations were investigated in a field study. Using publicly available simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, the early heading date gene HdAey2280 was mapped onto Aegilops tauschii chromosome 7DS between the flanking markers wmc438 and barc126 at distances of 15 and 9.1 cM, respectively. Further analysis indicated that HdAey2280 is a novel heading date gene. New SSR markers were developed based on the Ae. tauschii draft genome sequence, resulting in four new markers that were linked to the heading date gene HdAey2280. The closest distance of these markers was 1.9 cM away from the gene. The results collected in this study will serve as a framework for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs in the future.

AB Knowledge of specific peroxidases that respond to aphid herbivory is limited in C-4 grasses, but could provide targets for improving defence against these pests. A sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) peroxidase (SbPrx-1; Sobic.002G416700) has been previously linked to biotic stress responses, and was the starting point for this study. Genomic analyses indicated that SbPrx-1 was part of a clade of five closely related peroxidase genes occurring within a similar to 30kb region on chromosome 2 of the sorghum genome. Comparison of this similar to 30-kb region to syntenic regions in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) identified similar related clusters of peroxidases. Infestation of a susceptible sorghum cultivar with greenbugs (Shizaphis graminum Rondani) induced three of the five peroxidases. Greenbug infestation of switchgrass and foxtail millet plants showed similar inductions of peroxidases. SbPrx-1 was also induced in response to aphid herbivory in a greenbug-resistant sorghum line, Cargill 607E. These data indicate that this genomic region of C-4 grasses could be valuable as a marker to assess potential insect resistance in C-4 grasses.

AB China is one of the largest stripe rust epidemic areas in the world. Central Shaanxi, an important overwintering region, serves as a 'bridge' between the western over-summering and eastern epidemic regions. Understanding of resistance levels and Yr-gene distribution in regional wheat breeding lines may provide valuable recommendations for releasing resistant cultivars for managing the disease. A total of 183 wheat breeding lines developed for central Shaanxi were tested for seedling resistance to nine Chinese races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) in the greenhouse. In field tests, entries were evaluated for stripe rust resistance in Yangling, Shaanxi, an overwintering region for the pathogen and artificially inoculated with selected races. In Tianshui, Gansu Province, an over-summering region, entries were evaluated under natural infection of Pst. Molecular markers for Yr5, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr26 and Yr61 were used to determine the presence and absence of the genes. Among the 183 entries, 4 (2.2%) entries had effective all-stage resistance; 15 (8.2%) entries had adult-plant resistance; and 164 (89.6%) entries were susceptible to one or more races, especially to the potentially important races V26/CM42 and V26/Gui22. Over 95% of entries showed seedling stage susceptibility in Tianshui across years. Resistance genes Yr9, Yr17 and Yr24/Yr26 were postulated in some of the breeding lines based on the seedling responses and molecular markers. Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, Yr18 and Yr61 were not present in any of the breeding lines. These results suggest that, when multiple races of Pst disperse into Shaanxi from southern Gansu Province, over 90% of wheat breeding lines are susceptible. Based on the results, recommendations are made for releasing or not releasing the individual lines, and a strategy of combining genes for effective all-stage and adult-plant resistance is proposed for developing wheat cultivars with high-level durable resistance to stripe rust.

AB Stripe rust is a serious foliar disease posing a grave threat to wheat production worldwide. The most economical and environmentally friendly way to control this disease is to breed and deploy resistant cultivars. Zhongmai 175 is an elite winter wheat cultivar conferring resistance to a broad spectrum of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) races. To identify the resistance gene in the cultivar, genetic analysis was conducted using the parents, F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations derived from the cross of Lunxuan 987/Zhongmai 175. Segregations in the F-2 and F-2:3 populations indicated a single dominant gene conferring resistance to stripe rust in Zhongmai 175, temporarily designated YrZM175. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) with wheat iSelect 90K SNP array determined a preliminary location of YrZM175. Subsequently, YrZM175 was mapped on chromosome 2AS using simple sequence repeats (SSR), expressed sequence tags (EST) and newly-developed kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers, being flanked by Xgwm636 and Xwmc382 at genetic distances of 4.9 and 8.1 cM, respectively. Comparison of reaction patterns of YrZM175 on 23 Pst races or isolates and pedigree analysis with other genes on chromosome 2AS suggested that it is likely to be a new gene for resistance to stripe rust. The resistance gene and linked molecular markers will be useful in wheat breeding targeting for the improvement of stripe rust resistance.

AB Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) provides an efficient system for cytogenetic analysis of wild relatives of wheat for individual chromosome identification, elucidation of homoeologous relationships, and for monitoring alien gene transfers into wheat. This study is aimed at developing cytogenetic markers for chromosome identification of wheat and Aegilops geniculata (2n = 4x = 28, (UUMMg)-U-g-M-g-M-g) using satellite DNAs obtained from flow-sorted chromosome 5M(g). FISH was performed to localize the satellite DNAs on chromosomes of wheat and selected Aegilops species. The FISH signals for satellite DNAs on chromosome 5M(g) were generally associated with constitutive heterochromatin regions corresponding to C-band-positive chromatin including telomeric, pericentromeric, centromeric, and interstitial regions of all the 14 chromosome pairs of Ae. geniculata. Most satellite DNAs also generated FISH signals on wheat chromosomes and provided diagnostic chromosome arm-specific cytogenetic markers that significantly improved chromosome identification in wheat. The newly identified satellite DNA CL36 produced localized M-g genome chromosome-specific FISH signals in Ae. geniculata and in the M genome of the putative diploid donor species Ae. comosa subsp. sub-ventricosa but not in Ae. comosa subsp. comosa, suggesting that the M-g genome of Ae. geniculata was probably derived from subsp. subventricosa.

AB In this study, when germinated Triticum aestivum L. seeds were treated with 0, 2, 4 and 6 mM ethyl glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), root growth was suppressed and the mitotic index decreased. These inhibitory effects were positively correlated with EGTA concentration. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of several gene markers related to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle were significantly down-regulated. Confocal microscopy of Fluo-3/AM-stained roots showed chelation of nearly all of the Ca2+ within the root meristematic regions. Both random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and coupled restriction enzyme digestion-random amplification (CRED-RA) techniques showed significant increases in the levels of genomic DNA polymorphisms and degree of DNA methylation. The study provides information concerning the impact of Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, on the growth, expression of cell cycle transition marker genes, and changes in DNA structure and methylation in the wheat roots.

AB Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f.sp. tritici Erikss., is one of the most damaging diseases in wheat and is especially damaging for winter and facultative wheat. The objective of this study was to understand stripe rust resistance in 100 wheat and facultative wheat entries from the International Winter Wheat Improvement Program by conducting experiments in a greenhouse and in four field environments in Washington State, USA, and by genotyping molecular markers linked to Yr genes. Percentages of entries resistant to the rust races at the seedling stage were: PST-17, 44%; PST-37, 32%; PST-43, 45%; PST-45, 49%; PST-116, 18%; PST-100, 17%; and PST-127, 8%. Molecular markers were positive for genes Yr9, Yr17, and Yr18 and negative for Yr5, Yr10, and Yr15. Yr18 was present in 44 entries (44%). By using the highly virulent races PST-127 and PST-100 under controlled conditions, 16 entries were shown to have high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance and resistant-moderately resistant field reactions at all four field sites. Resistant entries, especially those with HTAP resistance, were also identified in the field experiments.

AB Cytoplasmic effects are important agronomical phenomena that have generated widespread interest in both theory and application. In the present study, five high yield rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) in large-scale cultivation in northeast China were determined to possess Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica-type cytoplasm using cytoplasmic subspecies-specific molecular markers. This was confirmed by cytoplasmic genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functional gene sequencing. Two of these five japonica cultivars were core breeding parents with high yield and the other three were super-high-yield varieties registered by the Ministry of Agriculture of China. We constructed nuclear substitution lines to further demonstrate whether and how this indica-type cytoplasm contributed to yield improvement by comparing yield components. The results showed that under the same japonica nuclear background, the lines with indica-type cytoplasm had a significant decrease in tillers in exchange for increased grain number per panicle compared with their recurrent parents. Our results implied that botanical basis of this cytoplasmic effect was to reduce the plant's branching differentiation to produce more floral organs under the constant nutrition. Our findings open another door for the utilization of inter-subspecific hybridization for the improvement of rice cultivar.

AB The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system fails to accurately predict disease recurrence in a considerable number of patients. Although node-negative (stage II) colon cancer is considered to have an overall good prognosis, the 5-year cancer-specific survival is reported at 81-83% in patients who did not have adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, reliance on node status alone has led to undertreatment in a subgroup of stage II patients with an unfavorable prognosis. The search for new and better prognosticators in stage II colon cancer has suggested several proposed biomarkers of better prognostication and prediction. However, few such biomarkers have reached widespread clinical utility. For the clinician swimming in the sea of emerging biomarkers, it may be hard to recognize the true floating aid from the surrounding debris in the search for more precise decision-making. Proposed markers include microsatellite instability (MSI) and KRAS and BRAF mutations, but a number of gene panels and consensus molecular subtypes are proposed for clinical prediction and prognostication as well. Although several studies suggest such biomarkers or panels to have a prognostic role in subgroups of patients, a number of studies are reported in heterogeneous groups with in part discordant findings, which again distorts the predictive and prognostic ability of each marker. Lack of homogeneous cohorts, underpowered studies in strict subgroups and challenges in analytical and clinical validity may hamper the progress toward widespread clinical utility. The harvest of prognostic biomarkers in colon cancer has yielded a huge number of candidates for which it is now time to separate the wheat from the chaff.

AB Retrotransposons are ubiquitous components of plants genomes, making them useful molecular markers for genetic diversity studies. We used inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) and retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) markers to assess genetic diversity and survey activity of LTR retrotransposon elements in 106 sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) genotypes from different research centers. We found 118 (out of 128) and 113 (out of 120) polymorphic loci using 14 IRAP and 14 REMAP primers, respectively. The Mantel test between IRAP and REMAP cophenetic matrices revealed low correlation (r = 0.55) between them. Dice similarities based on combined (IRAP + REMAP) data ranged from 0.34 to 0.93 among ("11 x 12" and "F1250/03") and ("HA335B" and "TMB51") genotypes, respectively. Classification of genotypes using the Dice similarity matrix derived from IRAP + REMAP data based on the unweighted pair-group method using the arithmetic average algorithm resulted in nine distinct groups. The studied genotypes were divided into seven groups considering their origins (research centers). Classification of genotypes can be useful to assess the genetic variation and gene flow between and within research centers. Analysis of molecular variance based on IRAP + REMAP data revealed a higher level of genetic variation within (94%) than between (6%) research centers. A high amount of gene flow was detected among USDA, ASGROW, and ENSAT groups. Because environmental factors have no influence on molecular markers, the construction of heterotic groups based on retrotransposon markers will be useful for the selecting of parents with a high probability of producing superior hybrids.

AB Lipid transfer protein (LTP) is a kind of small molecular protein, which is named for its ability to transfer lipid between cell membranes. It has been proved that the protein is involved in the responding to abiotic stresses. In this study, TaLTP-s, a genomic sequence of TaLTP was isolated from A genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum L). Sequencing analysis exhibited that there was no diversity in the coding region of TaLTP-s, but seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 by insertion/deletion (InDel) were detected. in the promoter regions of different wheat accessions. Nucleotide diversity (pi) in the region was 0.00033, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) extended over almost the entire TaLTP-s region in wheat. The dCAPS markers based on sequence variations in the promoter regions (SNP-207 and SNP-1696) were developed, and three haplotypes were identified based on those markers. Association analysis between the haplotypes and agronomic traits of natural population consisted of 262 accessions showed that three haplotypes of TaLTP-s were significantly associated with plant height (PH). Among the three haplotypes, HapIII is considered as the superior haplotype for increasing plant height in the drought stress environments. The G variance at the position of 207 by could be a superior allele that significantly increased number of spikes per plant (NSP). The functional marker of TaLTP-s provide a tool for marker-assisted selection regarding to plant height and number of spikelet per plant in wheat.

AB Activators of plant defence responses against pathogens are a potential alternative to fungicides, and the well-known resistance inducer salicylic acid (SA) protects wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) against powdery mildew. The aim of our work was to investigate through biochemical and molecular approaches whether lipid metabolism alteration could be considered as a characteristic feature of induced resistance in wheat upon SA infiltration. Expression levels of lox, PI-PLC2 and ltp genes encoding for a lipoxygenase (LOX), a phospholipase C2 and a lipid-transfer protein, respectively, were investigated. Increase of phosphatidic acid (PA) content 48h after SA infiltration in wheat leaves, upregulation of PI-PLC2 gene expression and increased diacylglycerol content were recorded, indicating the involvement of the PLC pathway in the PA synthesis. The wheat octadecanoid pathway was shown to be highly responsive to SA infiltration through simultaneous increases in lox gene expression and LOX activity, as well as a reduction in the content of linolenic acid. Changes in several FA contents and increases of the ltp gene expression were also recorded during the latest hours after SA infiltration. The status of lipid metabolism, as well as the connections between its components as markers of SA-induced resistance in wheat, are discussed.

AB Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch is a well-known medicinal plant in China. Despite its common use, very few molecular markers are available for this species, severely impeding any improvement of key agronomic traits. In this study, gene-based SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers were mined from the R. glutinosa transcriptome, assembled from leaf and root libraries, to obtain polymorphic information content (PIC). A total of 1,812 SSR (>= 18 bp) loci were identified from 1,747 transcripts, in which 1,018 transcripts had significant homology to known proteins, and 35 transcripts were identified as non-coding RNA. Of all SSR loci, AG/GT was the most frequent SSRs repeat type, and bias of base composition presented SSRs loci from non coding RNA. A set of 279 SSR primers (>= 20 bp) were synthesized, of which 204 were successfully amplified in the Wen85-5 genome and 91 had a polymorphic information content between 0.33 and 0.90. Seven pairs of polymorphic SSR primers were selected to evaluate the genetic diversity of 36 R. glutinosa germplasms, and results demonstrated that cultivars are differ considerably from wild strains and that distinct genetic relationships exist among wild strains. The SSRs identified in this study provide critical information for future R. glutinosa breeding. (C) 2016 Friends Science Publishers

AB Common wheat line N0324, derived from the cross wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides Thell) accession 5055 and Shaan 253, provides effective protection to powdery mildew. Analysis of 205 individuals in the segregating F-2 population generated by crossing N0324 with the susceptible cultivar Shaanyou 225 revealed that resistance in N0324 line was controlled by a single recessive gene designated temporarily as Pm5055. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were used to characterize the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm5055. Four SSR markers such as Xwmc441, Xbarc7, Xbarcl3 and Xbarc55 were linked to the gene with genetic distances of 10.6, 23, 23 and 23.9 cM, respectively. Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines were used to assign the chromosomal locations of the linked markers. The results suggested that this gene might be located on chromosome 2B. Pm5055 can be used to diversify powdery mildew resistance sources in future wheat breeding programs.

AB In this study, we compared the efficiency of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP) markers for analyzing genetic diversity, genetic relationships, and population structure of 87 super sweet corn inbred lines from different origins. SSR markers showed higher average gene diversity and Shannon's information index than SSAP markers. To assess genetic relationships and characterize inbred lines using SSR and SSAP markers, genetic similarity (GS) matrices were constructed. The dendrogram using SSR marker data showed a complex pattern with nine clusters and a GS of 53.0%. For SSAP markers, three clusters were observed with a GS of 50.8%. Results of combined marker data showed six clusters with 53.5% GS. To analyze the genetic population structure of SSR and SSAP marker data, the 87 inbred lines were divided into groups I, II, and admixed based on the membership probability threshold of 0.8. Using combined marker data, the population structure was K = 3 and was divided into groups I, II, III, and admixed. This study represents a comparative analysis of SSR and SSAP marker data for the study of genetic diversity and genetic relationships in super sweet corn inbred lines. Our results would be useful for maize-breeding programs in Korea.

AB Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are highly informative, polymorphic, and co-dominant Mendelian markers that provide an important genomic resource for genetic research. Recently, the use of large-scale transcriptome sequence has become a reliable and efficient approach for the identification and development of new EST-SSR markers. In this study, 8389 potential SSRs with a minimum of five repetitions for all motifs were identified from 121,210 unigenes. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the unigenes containing SSR loci participate in various biological processes of regulation, growth, development, metabolism, and apoptosis in wheat. As in many other plants, trinucleotide repeats were found to be the most abundant repeat units with a frequency of 62.33%. A subset of 300 EST-SSRs was randomly selected for the applicability of EST-SSRs to be evaluated. Of the 300 primer pairs tested, 177 (59%) yielded unambiguous PCR products among five wheat cultivars. Using the Chinese Spring nullitetrasomic line, 131 of the 177 EST-SSR primer pairs yielded products and 178 loci were found to be located on all the 21 wheat chromosomes. These findings suggest that the novel EST-SSR markers, as a basis for future genetic linkage and gene tagging analysis, are a valuable tool for genetic mapping, marker assisted selection, and comparative genome analysis.

AB Upon pathogen or insect attack, plants respond with production of a specific blend of the alarm signals salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), which are recognized as key players in the regulation of the signaling pathways involved. SA and JA responsive genes and SA/JA cross talk were well characterized in dicotyledonous species, but little is known in monocotyledonous plants. Using qRT-PCR, the expression profiles of SA and JA responsive genes were investigated after SA and JA treatments in monocots wheat. The results showed that Glu2 and PR-2 responded almost exclusively to SA, PR-3 and LOX2 responded positively to methyljasmonate (MeJA) treatment, while Lipase and PR-1.1 were induced in response to treatment with SA or MeJA. Furthermore, either by pathogen infection or exogenous application of hormones can activate the antagonistic effect between SA and JA in wheat, which has been well elucidated in dicotyledonous species. The outcomes of SA-JA interactions could be affected by the relative concentration of each hormone. This study shed light on marker genes that can represent SA and JA pathways in wheat and provided some clues for better understanding their interactions in monocot. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There are nearly 1000 rice landrace varieties in the Taihu basin, China. To assess the genetic diversity of the rice, 24 intragenic molecular markers (representing 17 starch synthesis-related genes) were investigated in 115 Taihu basin rice landraces and 87 improved cultivars simultaneously. The results show that the average genetic diversity and polymorphism information content values of the landraces were higher than those of improved cultivars. In total, 41 and 39 allele combinations (of the 17 genes) were derived from the landraces and improved cultivars, respectively; only two identical allele combinations were found between the two rice variety sources. Cluster analysis, based on the molecular markers, revealed that the rice varieties could be subdivided into five groups and, within these, the japonica improved rice and japonica landrace rice varieties were in two separate groups. According to the quality reference criteria to classify the rice into grades, some of the landraces were found to perform well, in terms of starch quality. For example, according to NY/T595-2002 criteria from the Ministry of Agriculture of China, 25 and 33 landraces reached grade 1, in terms of their apparent amylose content and gel consistency. The varieties that had outstanding quality could be used as breeding materials for rice quality breeding programs in the future. Our study is useful for future applications, such as genetic diversity studies, the protection of rice variety and improvment of rice quality in breeding programs.

AB Aegilops searsii (2n = 2x = 14, (SSs)-S-s), a wild relative of wheat, is a potentially important source of agriculturally useful genes for wheat breeding. The incorporation of Ae. searsii chromosome segments 1S(s) or 2S(s) into the wheat genome could significantly improve wheat flour quality and powdery mildew resistance, respectively. However, monitoring of wheatAe. searsii introgressions involving 1S(s) or 2S(s) chromosomes is difficult due to the lack of Ae. searsii-specific molecular markers. In this study, a total of 476 EST-or SSR-based primer pairs were synthesized and screened against a set of Chinese Spring (CS)-Ae. searsii addition lines and the control background variety CS. As a result, 17 molecular markers specific either for 1S(s) or 2S(s) chromosomes have been developed, among them, 1, 4, 2 and 10 markers have been assigned to chromosome arms 1S(s)S, 1S(s)L, 2S(s)S and 2S(s)L, respectively. All 17 markers can be successfully used to screen segregating populations. These markers are completely consistent with genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) results, indicating that these markers could be used for detecting Ae. searsii chromatin in wheat background.

AB A diversity study was carried out to genetically characterize 375 oat landraces (Avena sativa L. and Avena byzantina K. Koch) collected from Turkey and preserved in different gene banks. New assays interrogating oat-based microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism loci were used to characterize the landraces. The assays interrogated 176 alleles at 68 loci with an average of 4.5 alleles per locus. The polymorphism information content of the simple sequence repeats was relatively high with a mean value of 0.76. The first two principal components from the principal component analysis (PCA) separated two groups of accessions and explained 9.3% of the variation in the marker data. When the accessions were divided into two groups based on the first two principal components, the geographic origin matched well with the PCA grouping. Similarly, when classified by plant growth habit, the spring types originated mostly from the highlands of East Anatolia and from inner Anatolia. A heat map constructed based on marker data corresponded to province of origins of the landraces. The landraces with the geographical information are clustered into three major groups based on growth habit: winter, spring, or facultative. Population structure analysis also detected two subpopulations based on allele frequency and indicated a similar grouping with diversity analysis. Crown rust suggested that most of the lines did not contain major resistance genes. Of the landraces tested, only one (TL214) was considered resistant. Overall, this study has provided genetic characterization of unique germplasm from the center of oat domestication, which will be useful to oat breeding programs.

AB Some Spanish barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) landraces perform better than modern cultivars at low-production sites. The objective of this study was to identify favourable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for interesting agronomic traits contributed by the landrace SBCC073. To achieve this objective, a population of 100 BC1F5 lines was derived from the cross between the elite cultivar Orria, with high productivity, and the Spanish landrace SBCC073, which was the best performer in low-production trials. The population was evaluated in field trials for 3 years (2011, 2013, and 2014) in Zaragoza, Spain. The population was genotyped with a DArTseq genotyping-by-sequencing assay. A genetic linkage map was developed by using markers of four flowering-time genes and 1227 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of good quality. The genetic map resulted in 11 linkage groups, covering a total distance of 871.1 cM. Five QTLs for grain yield were detected on 2H.1, 4H, 5H and 6H.2. Alleles from SBCC073 contributed to increased yield in three of them. A region at the end of chromosome 5H contains favourable alleles for early vigour, higher grain yield and earlier flowering, all derived from SBCC073. Alleles from Orria contributed to increasing grain yield and simultaneously to reducing plant height on the same region of 6H.2, and to increasing 1000-kernel weight on chromosomes 3H and 5H.

AB Genetic stocks were developed for the localization and eventual cloning of the stem rust resistance gene SrR that occurs in wheat lines carrying the 1RS translocation from Secale cereale 'Imperial' rye. We have used a mutation-based approach for molecular analysis of the SrR region in rye. Forty-one independent mutants resulting in loss of SrR resistance were isolated: many of these were deletions of various sizes that were used to locate SrR with respect to chromosome group S markers. The analysis of the mutants showed that markers about 1 Mb apart flanking the barley Mla locus also flank SrR. Additionally, three of the approximately 20 closely related sequences of Mla in rye are deleted in each of six interstitial deletion mutants of SrR. The results indicate that the SrR region in rye is syntenic to the Mla region in barley or that SrR is possibly orthologous to the Mla locus.

AB Recurrent selection facilitated by dominant male sterility has been conducted to broaden the genetic basis for cultivar development in Brassica napus. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic variation in four base populations (C0-C3) and breeding lines from two of the populations produced during recurrent selection by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Genetic variation in four populations declined gradually with the advance of selection cycles as measured by expected genetic heterozygosity (from 0.2058 in C0 to 0.1536 in C3) but the decline was not statistically significant. When compared with the average genetic distances for 21 germplasm collections with wide geographical and genetic origins (0.4712) and seven breeding lines from pedigree selection (0.2059), seven breeding lines selected from the C1 population and 11 from the C3 population had a larger average genetic distance (0.5339 and 0.5486, respectively). Clustering analysis indicated that the lines from recurrent selection had a much lower genetic similarity than lines from pedigree selection. Our results suggest that base populations derived from recurrent selection could provide a wider genetic variation for selection of breeding lines with more broad genetic bases.

AB The tetraploid wheat Triticum timopheevii Zhuk (A(t)A(t)GG) is known as a source of genes determining resistance to many diseases. An introgressive line 842, with durable resistance to leaf rust was established by crossing T. aestivum cv. 'Saratovskaya29' with T. timopheevii ssp. viticulosum and used for mapping leaf rust resistance genes. Molecular analysis of the line 842 with polymorphic microsatellite markers detected introgressions of T. timopheevii into the homoeologous group 2 chromosomes of common wheat. Translocation breakpoints of introgressed fragments were localized between the markers Xgwm95 and Xgwm817 on chromosome 2A, as well as Xgwm1128 and Xgwm1067 on chromosome 2B. Linkage analysis demonstrated the association of disease resistance at the seedling stage with chromosome 2A. The gene was found to be linked with marker Xgwm817 at a genetic distance of 1.5 cM. The alien leaf rust resistance gene was temporarily designated as lrTt1.

AB PCR primers were designed for 78 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs), which represented a subset of over 800 SSRs that were located by us in wheat EST database. When tested for functionality on several varieties of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) including Chinese Spring, 64 of these 78 primer pairs were found to be functional. These 64 functional primer pairs were used for a study of transferability and polymorphism among 18 Triticeae species belonging to Triticum-Aegilops complex. These species had as many as seven genomes in their constitution and represented three ploidy levels (2x, 4x, 6x). The primer pairs each gave amplified products not only in progenitor species containing A, B (including S and G) and D genomes, but also in alien species that contained other genomes (M, N, C and U). The cross-species transferability was as high as 84%, and the fragments of expected size were available with 92% EST-SSR primers in one or more species. This suggested a high level of conservation of DNA sequences belonging to the transcribed portion of the genome, and also indicated that each wheat EST-SSR is perhaps derived from an SSR in an ancestral genome of Triticeae. A very high proportion (88%) of the above 92% EST-SSRs, which gave amplified fragments of expected size, detected polymorphism. The number of alleles ranged from 2 to 14 with an average of 6.8 alleles per locus. A number of EST-SSR primers also proved useful in discriminating different genera, species within a particular genus and the different genomes of the tribe Triticeae. Therefore, EST-SSRs may be used in studies on polymorphism, genetic diversity, gene mapping and synteny conservation across different species of Triticeae. This is in sharp contrast to the situation with genomic SSRs, which are more locus specific. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber transcripts coding for a germin-like protein (GLP) was revealed by differential display analysis in which early stages of cotton fiber development between a wild type line, Texas Marker-1 (TM1) and a near isogenic mutant, Naked Seed (N1) were compared. Transcripts of the cotton GLP (GhGLP1) accumulated specifically in TM1, but did not accumulate in the mutant although the GhGLP1 gene was present in both lines. The deduced protein sequence of GhGLP1 is similar to Prunus persica auxin-binding proteins, a barley ADP-glucose pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase and two different classes of hydrogen peroxide-producing enzymes: wheat germin oxalate oxidase and moss extracellular Mn-superoxide dismutase. Cotton GLPs constitute a multigene family like those of Arabidopsis, rice, soybean, and barley. GhGLP1 transcripts accumulated to their highest levels during the period of fiber expansion, followed by a sharp decline when the rate of cell expansion decreased. While germins and GLPs appear to be involved in defense mechanisms in some plants, both biotic and abiotic stress down-regulated the expression of GhGLP1. Numerous functions have been proposed for dicot GLPs. However, to date, there is little direct evidence for how these proteins function in vivo. The association of maximal GhGLP1 expression with stages of maximal cotton fiber elongation suggests that some GLPs may be important for cell wall expansion.

AB Stripe or yellow rust of wheat, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease in many wheat-growing regions of the world. A number of major genes providing resistance to stripe rust have been used in breeding, including one gene that is present in the differential tester Carstens V. The objective of this study was to locate and map a stripe rust resistance gene transferred from Carstens V to Avocet S and to use molecular tools to locate a number of genes segregating in the cross Savannah/Senat. One of the genes present in Senat was predicted to be a gene that is present in Carstens V. For this latter purpose, stripe rust response data from both seedling and field tests on a doubled haploid population consisting of 77 lines were compared to an available molecular map for the same lines using a non-parametric quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Results obtained in Denmark suggested that a strong component of resistance with the specificity of Carstens V was located in chromosome arm 2AL, and this was consistent with chromosome location work undertaken in Australia. Since this gene segregated independently of Yr1, the only other stripe rust resistance gene known to be located in this chromosome arm, it was designated Yr32. Further QTLs originating from Senat were located in chromosomes 1BL, 4D, and 7DS and from Savannah on 5B, but it was not possible to characterize them as unique resistance genes in any definitive way. Yr32 was detected in several wheats, including the North American differential tester Tres.

AB The leaf rust resistance gene Lr41 in wheat germplasm KS90WGRC10 and a resistance gene in wheat breeding line WX93D246-R-1 were transferred to Triticum aestivum from Aegilops tauschii and Ae. cylindrica, respectively. The leaf rust resistance gene in WX93D246-R-1 was located on wheat chromosome 2D by monosomic analysis. Molecular marker analysis of F-2 plants from non-critical crosses determined that this gene is 11.2 cM distal to marker Xgwm210 on the short arm of 2D. No susceptible plants were detected in a population of 300 F-2 plants from a cross between WX93D246-R-1 and TA 4186 (Lr39), suggesting that the gene in WX93D246-R-1 is the same as, or closely linked to, Lr39. In addition, no susceptible plants were detected in a population of 180 F-2 plants from the cross between KS90WGRC10 and WX93D246-R-1. The resistance gene in KS90WGRC10, Lr41, was previously reported to be located on wheat chromosome 1D. In this study, no genetic association was found between Lr41 and 51 markers located on chromosome 1D. A population of 110 F-3 lines from a cross between KS90WGRC10 and TAM 107 was evaluated with polymorphic SSR markers from chromosome 2D and marker Xgdm35 was found to be 1.9 cM proximal to Lr41. When evaluated with diverse isolates of Puccinia triticina, similar reactions were observed on WX93D246-R-1, KS90WGRC10, and TA 4186. The results of mapping, allelism, and race specificity test indicate that these germplasms likely have the same gene for resistance to leaf rust.

AB A chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library from germplasm line, FLIP 84-92C, was constructed to facilitate positional cloning of disease resistance genes and physical mapping of the genome. The BAC library has 23,780 colonies and was calculated to comprise approximately 3.8 haploid-genome equivalents. Studies on 120 randomly chosen clones revealed an average insert size of 100 kb and no empty clones. Colony hybridization using the RUBP carboxylase large subunit as a probe resulted in a very low percentage of chloroplast DNA contamination. Two clones with a combined insert size of 200 kb were isolated after the library was screened with a Sequence Tagged Microsatellite Site (STMS) marker, Ta96, which is tightly linked to a gene (Foc3) for resistance to fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.: Fr. f. sp. ciceris (Padwick) race 3 at a genetic distance of 1 cM. Also, these two clones were analyzed with several resistance gene analog (RGA) markers. End sequencing of these clones did not identify repetitive sequences. The development of the BAC library will facilitate isolation of Foc3 and allow us to perform physical mapping of this genomic region where additional R genes against other races of the wilt causing pathogen are positioned.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) is an economically important diploid model for the Triticeae; and a better understanding of low-temperature tolerance mechanisms could significantly improve the yield of fall-sown cereals. We developed a new resource for genetic analysis of winter hardiness-related traits, the 'Nure' x 'Tremois' linkage map, based on a doubled-haploid population that is segregating for low-temperature tolerance and vernalization requirement. Three measures of low-temperature tolerance and one measure of vernalization requirement were used and, for all traits, QTLs were mapped on chromosome 5H. The vernalization response QTL coincides with previous reports at the Vrn-1/Fr1 region of the Triticeae. We also found coincident QTLs at this position for all measures of low-temperature tolerance. Using Composite Interval Mapping, a second proximal set, of coincident QTLs for low-temperature tolerance, and the accumulation of two different COR proteins (COR14b and TMC-Ap3) was identified. The HvCBF4 locus, or another member of the CBF loci clustered in this region, is the candidate gene underlying this QTL. There is a CRT/DRE recognition site in the promoter of cor14b with which a CBF protein could interact. These results support the hypothesis that highly conserved regulatory factors, such as members of the CBF gene family, may regulate the stress responses of a wide range of plant species.

AB The inheritance of shoot regeneration through shoot-tip meristem culture derived from maize seedling was evaluated, and the markers (RAPD and SSR) associated with this regeneration character were identified both in a group of North American maize inbreds and a crossing population. A discrete distribution of percent regeneration and no. of shoots per explant was observed in the inbred group and the F-2 population. The results suggested that this regenerable trait was controlled by several major genes. Five RAPD markers were identified to be relevant to percent regeneration in maize shoot-tip culture system. One RAPD marker and three SSR markers were associated with no. of shoot per explant and its relevant traits. Of them marker BC603-1600 explained 18% of the variation for no. of shoot per explant and 16% of the variation for callus size. The BC603-1600 was sequenced and assigned in linkage group 7 based on a NCBI blast search. The information provided here should benefit to determine the genetic mechanisms involved in the maize regeneration response related to shoot meristem culture pathway and benefit to select high regenerable germplasm by using marker assisted selection.

   MAPS; CONSTRUCTION; GENOME; GENE; DNA
AB A study was undertaken to determine the utility in bread wheat of anchored PCR for the development of single locus SSR markers targeted at compound repeat motifs. In anchored PCR, microsatellite amplification is achieved using a single primer complementary to the flanking sequence, and one which anchors to the repeat junction of the compound SSR. The recovery rate of useable markers was found to be similar (43%) to that reported for conventionally generated SSRs. Thus, anchored PCR can be used to reduce the costs of marker development, since it requires that only half the number of primers be synthesised. Where fluorescence-based platforms are used, marker deployment costs are lower, since only the anchoring primers need to be labelled. In addition, anchored PCR improves the recovery of useful markers, as it allows assays to be generated from microsatellite clones with repeat sequences located close to their ends, a situation where conventional PCR amplification fails as two flanking primers cannot be designed. Strategies to permit the large-scale development of compound SSR markers amplified by anchored PCR are discussed.

AB The elite UK winter wheat cv. Riband was transformed with constructs containing rbcS in sense and antisense orientations driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter with a transformation efficiency of 1.2%. Of 77 primary transformants 31% of the sense-rbcS transformed lines and 78% of the antisense-rbcS transformed lines had decreased rubisco content compared to wild-type and marker-only controls, with decreases of up to 60%. However, in the T1 progeny which inherited the transgene, only 5% showed significantly decreased rubisco content and these effects were on the margins of significance. Five potential T2 homozygous lines from T1 parents which had transgene segregation consistent with a single locus were identified. There was no significant decrease in rubisco content relative to wildtype in any of these lines (LSD of 8% for P = 0.05). Expression of antisense rbcS transgenes in two of these T2 lines was low but was increased following exposure of the plants to 37 degreesC for 48 h. However this did not induce a significant decrease in rubisco protein content relative to controls. Southern analysis of two antisense lines showed that they had low copy number and 1-2 insertion events. In one of the two lines there was increased methylation of the ubiquitin intron in T2 samples compared to the T0 primary transformant. Further work is required to establish whether methylation occurred in all the lines which lost the phenotype, and therefore the likelihood of this being the cause. The disappearance of the decreased rubisco-content phenotype between generations may therefore be attributable to (1) greater activity of the ubiquitin promoter due to greater stress in the T0 generation plants and/or (2) increased methylation of the transgene promoter region between generations.

AB Inter-simple sequence repeat markers were employed to study the genetic structure of Fusarium graminearum populations collected from three Canadian provinces. Our study suggested high genetic diversity and frequent gene flow among population samples analysed. The analysis of molecular variance indicated that most of the gene diversity (91.78% to 97.23%) was distributed within populations. Frequent gene flow among the western prairie provinces and cluster analysis results indicated that the population sample from Alberta was closer to Saskatchewan than Manitoba, which could be the result of movement of the pathogen via infected grain or through wind-borne ascospore dispersal. Analysis of multilocus associations showed that all populations were in linkage equilibrium, indicating that sexual recombination is a frequent phenomenon in F graminearum populations from western Canada.

AB A review is presented of genetic strategies deployed in a 3-yr project on drought tolerance in barley. Data were collected on genetic, physiological and agronomic traits in non-irrigated and irrigated field trials in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. A wide range of barley germplasm (developed from African and European cultivars, adapted landraces and wild barleys) was tested, and positive traits were found in each gene pool. The contrasting environments of the three North African countries had major effects on plant/genotype performance. Genetic effects were also detected, as were genotype x environment interactions.
   A range of strategies were deployed to investigate the physiology and genetics of quantitative traits associated with field performance. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using backcross lines, recombinant inbred lines and doubled haploid mapping populations. A detailed genetic map was generated in the Tadmor x (ER/Apm) recombinant inbred lines, an important mapping population specifically developed by ICARDA (Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas) and CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) to study drought. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain yield and other important morphological and physiological traits were also identified in a population of doubled haploids derived from F 2 BC, plants from a cross between a cultivar and a wild barley accession. Significantly, the wild parental line was found to contribute a number of positive alleles for yield.
   Effects of major developmental genes could explain many of the responses observed. QTLs were found to cluster around major genes controlling flowering time (sgh1), plant stature (sdw1 and arie.GP) and ear type (vrs1), and it is highly likely that the associations represent pleiotropic effects. Some QTLs were associated with candidate genes such as dehydrins and rubisco activase. One of the most significant results was the identification and generation of material that out performed the best local standards in the three participating North African countries; the selected lines have now entered local breeding programmes. The strategies adopted provided information on physiological traits, genotypes and genetic markers that could be used for marker-assisted selection. Target QTLs and their associated genetic markers may be deployed in marker assisted selection programmes to match crop phenology to the field environment.

AB The use of two Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains for transformation of Triticum aestivum L. cv. Vesna was studied. Immature embryos, isolated 15 d after pollination, were co-cultivated with the super-binary LBA4404/pTOK233 and the binary AGL1/pDM805 vectors. While the transient GUS-intron expression was high (69.9 and 80.0%), the number of plants regenerated on selective media containing hygromycin or phosphinotricin did not exceed 0.4 and 0.13%, respectively. Nevertheless, the regenerated plants were fertile and produced seeds. The T-0 plants, as well as the T-1 seedlings, displayed the activity in the beta-glucuronidase histochemical assay and a positive signal in PCR analysis for the presence of uidA gene sequences in their genomes. The data suggest that the transformation of wheat cv. Vesna with both Agrobacterium strains is feasible.

AB To promote the implementation of genetic analyses and breeding programs, a set of microsatellite markers in sweetpotato should be developed, which cover the entire sweetpotato genome. To achieve this objective, 102 polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed using three different methods: 1) screening of a small-insert genomic library, 2) construction of a microsatellite-enriched library (51-fold enrichment) and 3) mining of EST databases. Approximately 8,000 clones of the small-insert library were screened with (GA)(20) and (CA)20 probes, and 42 positive clones were identified. One hundred and twenty-two clones containing microsatellites were identified from the enriched library, which consisted of 800 clones. Thirty-two and 47 primer pairs were designed for these clones containing microsatellites from the small-insert library and enriched library, respectively. Among the sweetpotato accessions examined, 27 of these microsatellite markers showed polymorphism. Eventually, 4,153 sequences from a published expressed sequence tag (EST) databases were mined as a source for the development of microsatellite markers, and 379 sequences containing microsatellites were identified. A total of 151 primer pairs were designed and 120 scorable microsatellite markers were obtained. Seventy-five EST-SSR loci showed length polymorphisms. Of these polymorphic loci, 71% were associated with some genes.

AB A set of Thatcher near-isogenic lines and two breeding lines were used to examine sequence tagged site (STS) markers linked to leaf rust resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr28, Lr29, Lr35, and a simple sequenced repeat (SSR) marker for Lr39. The selected STS markers for resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24 and Lr28 were identified in seven accessions by seven European laboratories. Near-isogenic lines of the spring wheat Thatcher were used as positive controls. Markers for resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24 were identified in all seven laboratories as amplification products of 1100 bp, 310 bp, 130 bp and 3 10 bp, respectively. The STS markers linked to resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr29, Lr35 and the SSR marker for Lr39 were robust and highly specific for these genes and will be useful in marker-assisted selection in wheat. However, the amplification product of 378 bp that corresponded with resistance gene Lr28 was detected in all accessions including genotypes lacking this gene in all seven laboratories. This marker needs to be improved.

AB Genotyping of 98 wheat cultivars/lines was carried out with molecular markers that are linked to the Pm1 locus: two bi-allelic (dominant) markers: the sequence-tagged site Xsts638-7A and the amplified fragment length polymorphism XE39M58-77-7A; and the multi-allelic simple sequence repeat marker Xgwm344-7A. Employing segregation data recorded in the population Chinese Spring x Virest (Pm1e), genetic mapping revealed that Xgwm344-7A and XE39M58-77-7A were distally linked to Pm1e in the repulsion phase with respective linkage distances of 0.9 cM and 4.8 cM, while Xsts638-7A was found to co-segregate with Pm1e in the coupling phase. The genotyping results of Xsts638-7A and XE39M58-77-7A confirmed disease scoring, except for the accessions of cultivars Omega, Remus and Weihenstephan Stamm M1N. The SSR marker Xgwm344 amplified 15 different fragments ranging from 102 bp to 147 bp, with 15 entries being null-allelic at the 7A and 7B homoeoloci. It was found that wheat lines having resistance alleles at the Pm1 locus mainly show the null allele at the Xgwm344-7A locus. Due to their fast-evolving nature, the use of multi-allelic SSRs for genotype determination may be complicated. However, the combined use of multiple linked marker alleles seems to be a promising approach for genotyping a broad range of plant materials.

AB Based on seedling resistance tests, five resistance genes (Lr10, Lr3, Lr13, Lr14a and Lr37) against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) were identified in 16 cultivars of European winter wheat. STS and SCAR markers were used to verify the presence of the resistance genes Lr37 and Lr10 against leaf rust in cultivars, near-isogenic lines and segregating populations. The Lr37 gene is present in a small translocation from Triticum ventricosum Ces. (Aegilops ventricosa Tausch) and is tightly linked with resistance genes Yr17 and Sr38. The Lr37 gene was identified in the cultivars Kris, Clever, Slade, Apache, Caphorn, Lorraine, Balthasar, Renan and confirmed by two PCR markers. The F-3 progenies of the crosses Kris (Lr37) x Nutka (Lr37 not present) were used for map construction. Two STS/SCAR markers specific for Lr37 were mapped in relation to nine polymorphic microsatellites on chromosome 2AS. The mirosatellite marker Xgwm1176 mapped relatively close to the STS and SCAR markers for Lr37 with a linkage distance of 4.1 cM.

AB The range of publicly available data on plant nucleotide sequences opens a new possibility in the design of SNP assays. The purpose of this study was to identify point mutations in genomic sequences closely linked to the Lr1 leaf rust resistance gene, and to develop SNP markers based on primer extension (SNuPE) facilitating efficient marker-based selection procedures, e.g. the pyramiding of resistance genes. Studies were performed on the panel of 37 wheat cultivars, the set of 41 Thatcher near-isogenic lines of spring wheat and on the 21 individuals derived from doubled-haploid (DH) lines derived from 'Henika' (Lr1) x 'IPG-SW-14'. A minisequencing reaction run with Lr1_98F primer detected four genotypes (T, C+T, C and "null") in the set of all Triticum aestivum varieties tested. In this study, it turned out that the T allele is associated with the Lr1 gene in a wide genetic background.

AB Three combinations of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains and vectors were used in the transformation of selected Polish wheat cultivars. The combinations were: two hypervirulent strains, AGLI, containing the pDM805 binary plasmid, and EHA101, containing pGAH; and the common Agro strain LBA4404, harboring the super-binary pTOK233 vector. pDM805 contained bar under the control of Ubil promoter, pGAH had nptII under nos, and pTOK233 had hpt under 35S. Additionally, pDM805 and pTOK233 carried the gus reporter gene under the Act1 promoter or 35S promoter, respectively. The highest selection rate was 12.6% and was obtained with EHA101(pGAH) on a kanamycin-containing medium. Sixty-five of the plants grown on that medium were PCR positive. The second best combination was LBA4404(pTOK233) and kanamycin selection, which gave an average transformation rate of 2.3%. Phosphinothricin selection gave 1.0% transformation efficiency, while hygromycin, depending on the strain/vector used, gave from 0.2 to 0.4%. PCR tests in T-1 revealed that 67% of the lines showed a 3:1 segregation ratio, and 11% a 15:1 ratio, while in 22%, segregation was non-Mendelian. The high number of T-0 transgenic plants containing one copy of the transgene was confirmed via Southern blot analysis. Kanamycin resistance in the T-1 generation was very low; in some lines, all the progeny were kanamycin sensitive. GUS expression, only tested in young T-1 plants, was in agreement with Mendelian segregation in three out of the twelve tested. The factors influencing the efficiency of selection and transgene expression are discussed in this paper.

AB Stripe rust (yellow rust) is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. The most effective control method of stripe rust is the use of resistance genes. A very effective stripe rust resistance gene, Yr26, originating from Triticum turgidum L., was transferred into two common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars of Turkey through backcrossing using closely linked microsatellite markers. A 6VS/6AL translocation line (92R149) was used as the source of Yr26 because this gene was originally thought to be located in the short arm of chromosome 6V. Wheat cultivars, Gerek-79 and Gun-91, were used as the recurrent parents in backcrossing. Resistant backcross lines were selected using closely linked chromosome 1B microsatellite markers (Xgwm11 and Xgwm18). Resistant backcross lines were also screened with a 6VS specific SCAR marker (SCAR(1265)), and results reconfirmed that Yr26 was not carried on 6VS. Highly resistant BC4F3 plants of Gerek-79 and Gun-91 were produced and the existence of Yr26 was confirmed with the linked Xgwm11 and Xgwm18 microsatellite markers.

AB Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko) is a cosmopolitan pest of wheat. Development of resistant genetic sources is economically and environmentally effective. The objective of this study was to localize and tag a Russian wheat aphid resistance gene in Iranian tetraploid wheat line `1881', using microsatellite markers. Thirty pairs of microsatellite primers of group 7 chromosomes of wheat were screened, using bulked-segregant analysis. Four microsatellite primer pairs of chromosome 7B revealed polymorphism between susceptible and resistant parents and bulk DNA samples of resistant and susceptible individuals, among which the linkage of 2 markers was confirmed. The locus Xgwm46-7B was the closest to the RWA resistance locus with a distance of 10 cM. The identified locus on chromosome 713 of the tetraploid wheat line `1881' may be orthologous to one of the previously identified RWA resistance loci on chromosome 7D.

AB Brachypodium distachyon is a ubiquitous, temperate grass species which is being developed and exploited as an alternative model to rice, in order to gain access to important syntenic regions of the genomes of less tractable relatives such as wheat. As part of this initiative, this paper describes for the first time the cytotaxonomy of members of the polyploid series of this species, and challenges the assumption that the series evolved simply by chromosome doubling. In situ hybridization using genomic DNA probes and rDNA markers uncovers a hybrid origin of several of the polyploid ecotypes, and sheds light upon the complex evolution of this species and its close relatives.

AB MAD2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2) is a highly conserved protein involving in spindle checkpoint control. MAD2 locates at spindle-unattached kinetochores during prophase and dissolves from spindle-attached kinetochores towards metaphase. In this study, we isolated homologous genes encoding for MAD2 from hexaploid wheat. The three homoeologous genes on the long arms of the group-2 chromosomes shared approximately 99% similarity of the nucleotide sequence in coding regions. The intron-exon structures of the three homoeologues were also conserved, showing high similarities to that of the Arabidopsis MAD2 gene. All three homoeologues were transcribed in roots and spikes but not in leaves. We generated antibodies against the polypeptides with amino acid sequences derived from the cDNA sequences of the wheat MAD2 homologues. Using these antibodies, we found MAD2 in wheat root-tip cells to change in location and amount through the cell cycle, similar to those reported for human MAD2. Intense immunostaining signals were observed at the centromeres of all metaphase chromosomes when root-tips were treated with colchicine, a microtubule-destabilizing drug, but no signals were observed in untreated chromosomes. Thus, the wheat MAD2 protein could be a good marker for the functional kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes in wheat.

AB Available winter hardy lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) germplasm has prompted interest in the development and use of cultivars that can be fall planted in cold highland areas. This change in production of lentil from normally spring sown to fall sown is environmentally sound and increases yield potential. Understanding the mode of inheritance of winter hardiness in lentil would assist breeding efforts. The objectives of this study were to determine the inheritance and heritability of winter hardiness in lentil. Ten F-6 derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations from crosses of winter hardy germplasm lines with nonhardy germplasm were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications at Haymana, and Sivas, Turkey, and at Pullman, WA, USA, between 1997 and 2001. Meaningful data for an analysis of the inheritance of winter hardiness were available only at Haymana in 1997-1998 and at Pullman in 1998-1999, indicating infrequent occurrences of sufficiently cold winters to provide differential killing. Percent survival was calculated on the basis of plant stand counts recorded after establishment in the fall and regrowth in the spring. Parental line WA8649041 was the most winter hardy followed by WA8649090, ILL-1878, and ILL-669. General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were significant at both locations. Heritability estimates among the 10 RIL populations ranged from 15.9 to 90.7%. Inheritance patterns of winterhardiness appeared to be quantitative on the basis of frequency distributions and the lack of discrete segregation classes. Since winter hardiness in lentil appears to be a quantitative trait, accumulation of genes responsible for winter survival will probably require stringent field testing or marker assisted selection.

AB Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) germplasm with sufficient winter hardiness to survive most winters in cold northern areas is available. However, the use of that germplasm in breeding programs is hampered by variable winter conditions that make field evaluations needed for effective breeding and selection difficult. Our objectives were to gain additional information on the genetics of winter hardiness in lentil by QTL analysis and to identify markers for use in marker-assisted selection. A total of 106 F-6 derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross WA8649090/Precoz were evaluated for winter survival in the field at Pullman, WA, USA, Haymana, Turkey, and Sivas, Turkey, in a randomized complete block design with three replications over 3 yr. Winter survival was based on plant stand counts before and after winter. In addition, winter injury was monitored at Pullman during the 1998-1999 winter season. Mean survival of the RILs was 49.7, 5.3, and 89.5% at Haymana in 1997-1998, at Pullman in 1998-1999, and at Haymana in 1999-2000, respectively. For QTL analysis of winter survival, three QTL were detected at Haymana in 1997-1998, one QTL was detected at Pullman in 1998-1999, and three QTL were identified at Haymana in 1999-2000. Only one of the QTL was common to all environments. For winter injury scores at Pullman in 1999, four QTL were identified that influenced winter survival. Overall results indicated that winter hardiness is influenced by several genes and the cumulative effects of winter stress.

AB Effective cumulative temperature (ECT) after heading would be a more reasonable parameter for seed sampling of pre-harvest sprouting/seed dormancy (SD) tests in segregating populations than the days after flowering. SD is an important agronomic trait associated with grain yielding, eating quality and seed quality. To identify genomic regions affecting SD at different grain-filling temperatures, and to further examine the association between SD and ECT during grain-filling, 127 double haploid (DH) lines derived from a cross between ZYQ8 (indica)/JX17 (japonica) by anther culture were analyzed. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and their digenic epistasis for SD were identified using a molecular linkage map of this population. A total of four putative QTLs for SD (qSD-3, qSD-5, 6 and 11) were detected on chromosomes 3, 5, 6 and 11, together explaining 41.4% of the phenotypic variation. Nine pairs of digenic epistatic loci were associated with SD on all but chromosome 9, and their contributions to phenotypic variation varied from 2.87%-8.73%. The SD QTL on chromosome 3 was identical to the QTLs found in other mapping populations with different genetic backgrounds, which could be a desirable candidate for gene cloning and marker-assisted selection in rice breeding.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive disease of wheat worldwide. FHB resistance genes from Sumai 3 and its derivatives such as Ning 7840 have been well characterized through molecular mapping. In this study, resistance genes in Wangshuibai, a Chinese landrace with high and stable FHB resistance, were analyzed through molecular mapping. A population of 104 F-2 -derived F-7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from the cross between resistant landrace Wangshuibai and susceptible variety Alondra's'. A total of 32 informative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs (EcoRI/MseI) amplified 410 AFLP markers segregating among the RILs. Among them, 250 markers were mapped in 23 linkage groups covering a genetic distance of 2,430 cM. In addition, 90 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were integrated into the AFLP map. Fifteen markers associated with three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance (P < 0.01) were located on two chromosomes. One QTL was mapped on 113 and two others were mapped on 3B. One QTL on 3BS showed a major effect and explained up to 23.8% of the phenotypic variation for type II FHB resistance.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), is a significant insect pest of wheat worldwide. Morphological and molecular markers associated with RWA resistance could be used to increase the accuracy and efficiency of selection of resistant germplasm and facilitate transfer to desirable wheat genotypes. The objective of this work was to identify microsatellite (SSR) markers linked to the RWA resistance gene (Dn4) and glume-colour gene (Rg2) using a population of F-2-derived F-3 families originating from a cross between a susceptible line (synthetic hexaploid-11) and a resistance cultivar (Halt). Two microsatellite markers Xgwm106 and Xgwm337 flanked Dn4 on the short arm of chromosome I D at 5.9 and 9.2 cM, respectively. Two other microsatellite markers, Xpsp2999 and Xpsp3000, at the distal part of this chromosome arm are linked to Dn4 and to Rg2. The accuracy and efficiency of marker-assisted selection were calculated for homozygous Dn4Dn4 genotypes in the F-2 generation. The gene Rg2 for red glume colour can also be used for marker-assisted selection of Dn4 gene individually and in combination with microsatellite markers. When used together, the closest markers Xgwm106 and Xgwm337, provide 100% accuracy and 75% efficiency. One hundred percent accuracy is also achieved when the morphological marker red glume is used in combination with either Xgwm106 or Xgwm337. Using these flanking markers, it may be possible to fix resistance to RWA in the first segregating generation of an F-2 population without infestation with aphids.

AB Photoperiod response is a major determinant of duration of growing stages in wheat. Conscious selection for these photoperiod response genes in plant breeding programs will yield genotypes with better adaptation to diverse environments. To provide a starting point for the development of molecular markers useful for the selection process, genetic maps around the photoperiod insensitive gene Ppd-B1 were built employing three segregating populations. Of 25 markers that were selected for the Ppd-B1 region, only two could be mapped across all three populations. In pairwise comparisons, the extent of transferable markers ranged from three to eight. Recombination frequencies of markers distal to Ppd-B1 were more homogeneous than those of proximal markers. This finding suggested a closer proximity of Ppd-B1 to the markers that were mapped distal to breakpoint 0.83 in the physical map of chromosome 2BS.

AB The wheat microsatellite XGWM261 is of interest to wheat breeders because of its linkage to a commercially significant reduced height gene (Rht8). Previous studies have indicated that there are three major alleles at the XGWM261 locus and that the majority (90%) of varieties are homozygous, generating PCR products of 192, 174, or 165 bp. As a preliminary investigation of heterozygosity and sequence variation at the XGWM261 locus in Australian wheat varieties, we cloned and sequenced PCR products from 24 hexaploid varieties of significance in Australian breeding programmes. Three major alleles of 192, 174 and 164 bp were found, but a 165 bp allele was not detected. Prior genotyping via electrophoretic methods had indicated that 2 of the 24 (8%) varieties were heterozygous. Our results indicate that 6 varieties (25%) carry 2 or more of the major alleles. It is not clear whether this results from heterozygosity within individual seeds, or from heterogeneity of breeding stocks. With respect to the microsatellite region itself, we found that the 174 bp and 164 bp alleles actually represent (CT)(11)AG and (CT)(6)AG motifs (respectively) rather than (CT)(12) and (CT)(7). This finding has diagnostic potential. A further 2 varieties also carry an interrupted (CT)(n)CC(CT)(n) microsatellite not previously recorded. It is unclear whether this represents a separate allelic lineage or is simply the result of replication error.

AB Z-DNA forms transiently behind the active RNA polymerases, because of the mechanical torsional stress produced during transcription. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the distribution of Z-DNA stretches signals the sites related to nuclear transcription. To localize transcription, the in situ assay for active RNA polymerases, that allows the elongation of the already initiated transcripts but no initiation of new ones (run-on experiments), was carried out in isolated nuclei of Allium cepa L. root meristems. Both nucleolar and non-nucleolar sites appeared labelled. Nucleoli were most active in transcription than the multiple non-nucleolar foci altogether. In situ immunodetection of Z-DNA provided images that were comparable to those obtained after the run-on assay, with one exception: while Z-DNA and transcription sites were scattered throughout the whole nucleus, Z-DNA also accumulated in the nuclear periphery, where no transcription foci were detected in the run-on assays. The peripheral Z-conformation signals might correspond to dsRNA segments present in the pre-mRNA in the process of their export to cytoplasm. The Z-containing structures nearly disappeared when non-nucleolar RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription had been previously abolished by the adenosine analogue DRB (5,6-dichloro-l-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole). This inhibition selectively decreased the amount of all nucleoplasmic Z structures. On the other hand, the inhibition of the nucleolar RNA polymerase I by cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) prevented the presence of Z-DNA in nucleoli. We propose to use the in situ immunodetection of Z-DNA as a marker of the transcription level in both nucleolus and non-peripheral nucleoplasmic regions of nuclei. Co-detection of Z-DNA and of intermediate filament (IF) proteins, the major components of the nuclear matrix, was also carried out. The IFA antibody recognises a conserved epitope essential for dimerization of the multiple IF proteins. They co-localized with most nucleolar Z-DNA, but not with the nucleoplasmic ones. In the nuclear periphery, the Z-positive signals were adjacent to the IF proteins constituting the lamina, though both signals did not often co-localize.

SO HEREDITAS
LA English
DT Article
ID THERMOSTABILITY; WHEAT
AB Allelic diversity and inheritance of polymorphic sites of the intron III-exon IV region of the seed specific beta-amylase gene Bmy1 were studied in a set of 55 barley accessions composed mainly of old Latvian and Scandinavian commercial varieties and three Hordeum spontaneum lines from Israel. A CAPS-marker was used for genotyping the C-698 --> T polymorphism encoding alleles of beta-amylase with different thermostability. The genotype C-698 which is diagnostic for a more thermostable isoform of the beta-amylase was detected in 13 of the investigated accessions. In most cases the origin of the C-698 genotype could be traced back to the old Danish variety Binder in the pedigree. However, this genotype was lost in later varieties originating from Binder. A 6+1 bp deletion event in intron III of the beta-amylase gene was in all cases linked to the presence of the C-698 mutation, while the repeat number of a microsatellite in intron III had no correlation to the presence of the C-698 mutation. Sequence analysis revealed a number of haplotypes within exon IV that did not result in amino acid changes due to the degenerated genetic code.

AB Leaf rust resistance gene Lr28 has been transferred form Aegilops speltoides into bread wheat on chromosome 4AL. To identify the molecular markers linked to Lr28 the available microsatellite markers for wheat chromosome arm 4AL were surveyed on near isogenic lines (NILs) of Triticum aestivum cultivars having Lr28 gene, other Lr genes and susceptible cultivars. A null allelle of Xgwm 160 marker was found to be associated with Lr28. Linkage between the marker and the Lr28 resistance gene was confirmed using F-2 mapping population of cross PBW343 and HD2329 + Lr28.

AB The identification and mapping of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with virus resistance in maize (Zea mat's L.) are reviewed. Genes or major QTL for resistance to Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), Maize mosaic virus, Maize streak virus, High Plains virus and Maize chlorotic dwarf virus have been mapped in the maize genome. Resistance to other viruses including Maize rayado fino virus, maize fine streak virus and maize necrotic streak virus has been identified, but not characterized genetically. Clusters of maize virus resistance genes are located on chromosomes 3, 6 and 10. The cluster on chromosome 6 (bin 6.01 near umc85) carries resistance to three members of the Potyviridae (MDMV, SCMV and WSMV). The clusters on chromosomes 3 (bin 3.05 near umc102) and 10 (bin 10.05 near umc44) carry resistance to phylogenetically diverse viruses as well as bacterial and fungal pathogens.

AB A wheat germin gene, with oxalate oxidase (OxO) activity, can be used as a sensitive reporter gene in both monocot and dicot transformations. Detection of H2O2 generated from OxO oxidation of oxalate provides simple, rapid detection of gene expression. Inexpensive substrates are required for both assays. OxO activity, could be detected histochemically in minutes, without chlorophyll clearing procedures. This assay was used to optimize transformation procedures and to track stable transgene expression in breeding populations over many generations. A simple spectrophotometric quantitative enzyme activity assay was used to select lines with various levels of transgene expression and to monitor transgene silencing phenomena. The quantitative OxO assay can also be used as an internal DNA delivery standard with a second reporter gene used in gene expression studies. The simplicity of the assay is ideal for screening large populations to identify primary transgenics, for monitoring transgene segregation in large populations in field studies and for assessing stability of transgene expression over numerous generations.

AB Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are useful markers for gene diagnosis and mapping of genes on chromosomes. However, polyploidy, which is characteristic of the evolution of higher plants, complicates the analysis of SNPs in the duplicated genes. We have developed a new method for SNP analysis in hexaploid wheat. First, we classified a large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from wheat in silico. Those grouped into contigs were anticipated to correspond to transcripts from homoeologous loci. We then selected relatively abundant ESTs, and assigned these contigs to each of the homoeologous chromosomes using a nullisomic/tetrasomic series of Chinese Spring wheat strains in combination with pyrosequencing. The ninety genes assigned were almost evenly distributed into seven homologous chromosomes. We then created a virtual display of the relative expression of these genes. Expression patterns of genes from the three genomes in hexaploid wheat were classified into two major groups: (1) genes almost equally expressed from all three genomes; and (2) genes expressed with a significant preference, which changed from tissue to tissue, from certain genomes. In 11 cases, one of the three genes in the allopolyploid was found to be silenced. No preference for gene-silencing in particular genomes or chromosomes was observed, suggesting that gene-silencing occurred after polyploidization, and at the gene level, not at the chromosome or genome level. Thus, the use of this SNP method to distinguish the expression profiles of three homoeologous genes may help to elucidate the molecular basis of heterosis in polyploid plants.

AB The fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum attacks the seed spikes of barley and wheat, causing sterility, reduced seed weight and accumulation of mycotoxins. To explore infection patterns in barley and in the Arabidopsis model system, the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) was used to transform F. graminearum. Inoculation of intact barley spikes resulted in rapid colonization of the brush hairs (ovary epithelial hairs) at the extruded seed tip within 7 It. Colonization followed a pattern of rapid basipetal growth along the pericarp epithelium (interior to the lemma and palea), accompanied by slower growth inward through the pericarp and testa. However, at 16 days after infection the aleurone and starchy endosperm remained uninfected, despite heavy colonization of the pericarp. Colonization of the outer lemma also occurred but was much slower. No increase in amylase enzyme activities was found, discounting the possibility that F. graminearum utilizes gibberellin-induced host enzymes to tap the endosperm for nutrients. The transformed Fusarium strain readily infected Arabidopsis thaliana leaves and produced copious spores within distant leaves. Results show the utility of gfp in tracing the growth of this pathogen, without misinterpretation due to contaminating fungi, and for resistance studies utilizing the Arabidopsis model system.

AB Experiments were conducted to produce transgenic barley plants following infection of immature embryos with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Transformed callus was obtained using hygromycin resistance as a selectable marker and either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter. Significantly reduced plant transformation frequencies were obtained with the GFP gene compared to GUS. However, GFP proved to be an excellent reporter of early transformation events and was used to compare four barley cultivars for efficiency in two phases of transformation: the generation of stably transformed barley callus and the regeneration of plantlets from transformed callus. Transformed callus was generated at a high frequency (47-76%) in all four cultivars. Regeneration of transformed plantlets was also achieved for all four cultivars although the frequency was much higher for Golden Promise than for the other three genotypes, reiterating that genotype is an important determinant in the regenerative ability of barley. This study has demonstrated for the first time that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation can be used to transform the Australian cultivars Sloop and Chebec.

AB The effects of factors known to influence the level of polymorphism at microsatellite loci were studied using 99 markers and seven lines of bread wheat. Mutational factors as well as indirect selective events shape diversity at these loci. Theory predicts that the selection of favorable alleles should reduce polymorphism at neutral neighboring loci in genomic areas with low recombination rates. In wheat, local recombination rate is positively correlated with physical distance from the centromere. Seventy four loci among the 99 used could be physically located on the chromosome. We studied how the following affected the diversity among a set of inbred lines: the length of the alleles, the motif (CA versus CT), the structure of the loci (perfect versus imperfect) and the chromosomal position of the loci. For each locus, we determined whether the polymorphism observed at a locus was compatible with the Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM) or the Two-Phase Model (TPM). Both the mutation rate and the compatibility with the SMM or the TPM were shown to be variable between loci. Wheat microsatellite loci were found to be more variable when segregating alleles were perfect and had long motifs (composed of many repetitions). Diversity observed at 19 loci was not compatible with the SMM. Loci located in distal regions, with presumably high recombination rates, had longer allele sizes and were more polymorphic than loci located in proximal regions. We conclude that both mutation factors and indirect selective events vary according to the local recombination rate and therefore jointly influence the level of polymorphism at microsatellite loci in wheat.

AB Here we report the first genomic library of wild rice constructed on a plant-transformation-competent binary vector (BIBAC2) and transformation of the large insert DNA into rice via Agrobacterium. We selected Oryza officinalis for genomic library construction. The library consists of 55,296 clones and stored in one hundred forty-four 384-well plates. Random sampling of 140 clones indicated an average insert size of 71 Kb at a range of 15-235 Kb and 4.8% empty vectors. Four wheat chloroplast probes and four maize mitochondrial probes were hybridized separately to the library, showing that contamination with organellar DNAs is very low (0.61% and 0.04%, respectively). The binary bacterial artificial chromosome (BIBAC) library provides 5.3 haploid genome equivalents, implying a 99.5% probability of recovering any specific sequence of interest. A stability test indicated that the large DNA inserts were stable in this BIBAC vector both in host cells of Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium. Two restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers R288 and C820, which co-segregate with brown planthopper (BPH) resistance gene Qbp2, were used to screen the library, and identified seven and eight positive clones, respectively. The candidate clones of target gene isolated from the library are directly used to transform cultivated rice. After screening the Agrobacterium strains and helper plasmids, and using an improved procedure of transformation, a BIBAC clone with. 120 Kb O. officinalis DNA insert was successfully transferred into the rice genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The system developed here should serve as source for gene discovery, gene cloning and genome-related research in wild rice. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The response regulator gene gacA influences the production of several secondary metabolites in both pathogenic and beneficial Pseudomonas spp. In this study, we developed primers and a probe for the gacA gene of Pseudomonas species and sequenced a 425 bp fragment of gacA from ten Pseudomonas strains isolated from different plant-associated environments. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern hybridization showed that gacA is highly conserved within the genus Pseudomonas: multiple strains of different Pseudomonas species all responded positively to the probe, whereas no response was obtained from 18 other strains representing 14 species that belong to eight different genera of Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas. Furthermore, from a total of approximately 550 indigenous bacterial isolates obtained from the rhizosphere of wheat, all isolates that hybridized with the gacA probe were classified as Pseudomonas spp. by group-specific primers. Isolates that did not respond with the gacA probe and primers were identified as bacterial genera other than Pseudomonas, including Stenotrophomonas, Cryseomonas and Comamonas spp. These results indicate that gacA can be used as a complementary genetic marker for detection of Pseudomonas spp. in environmental samples. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from the newly sequenced gacA fragments and the sequences of gacA homologues present in the databases, showed six distinct clusters that correspond to the following bacterial families: Pseudomonaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Alteromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, Burkholderia and Xanthomonas. Within the Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, polymorphisms within gacA and its homologues allowed identification of six and five subclusters respectively. Comparison of the gacA gene and GacA protein-based trees with the tree inferred from 16S rDNA sequences yielded a similar overall clustering. These results suggest that gacA and its homologues may provide complementary markers for phylogenetic studies of Pseudomonas spp. and Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas.

The primers amplified fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and were designed following alignment of comparable sequences for a range of predator and prey species. Each of the primer pairs proved to be species-specific to a Collembola species, amplifying DNA fragments from 211 to 276 base pairs in length. Following consumption of a single collembolan, prey DNA was detectable in 100% of spiders after 24 h of digestion. We report the first use of DNA-based techniques to detect predation by arthropods on natural populations of prey in the field. All three species of Collembola were consumed by the spiders. By comparing the ratios of the Collembola species in the field with the numbers of spiders that gave positive results for each of those species, it was possible to demonstrate that the spiders were exercising prey choice. Overall, a single target species of Collembola was eaten by 48% of spiders while a further 16% of spiders contained DNA from two different species of Collembola. Preference was particularly evident for I. anglicana, the species most frequently found in spider guts yet the least numerous of the three target species in the field.

AB Differential responses in host-nematode pathotype interactions occur in wheat lines carrying different cereal cyst nematode resistance (Cre) genes. Cre1, located on chromosome 213, confers resistance to most European nematodes and the sole Australian pathotype, while Cre3, present on chromosome 2D, is highly resistant to the Australian pathotype and susceptible to a number of European pathotypes. Genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins that cosegregate with the Cre3 locus cross hybridize to homologues whose restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns distinguish near-isogenic Cre1 nematode-resistant wheat lines. Genetic mapping showed that the NBS-LRR gene members that distinguished the Cre1 near-isogenic lines were located on chromosome 2BL at a locus, designated Xcsl107, that cosegregates with the Cre1 locus. A haplotype of NBS-LRR genes from the Xcsl107 locus provides a diagnostic marker for the presence of Cre1 nematode resistance in a wide collection of wheat lines and segregating families. Genetic analysis of NBS-LRR haplotypes that cosegregate with Cre1 and Cre3 resistance, together with flanking cDNA markers and other markers from homoeologous group 2 chromosomes, revealed a conserved gene order that suggests Cre1 and Cre3 are homeoloci.

AB The pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1b) of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a marker for the attack by the powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, Bgh) and other pathogens. PR-1b consists of 164 amino acids and has a potential signal peptide for export into the cell wall. Here, we show that PR-lb is differentially expressed in near-isogenic barley lines exhibiting various forms of defence phenotypes including papilla formation and the hypersensitive cell death. To elucidate PR-1b function, we transiently silenced PR-1 expression by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) interference in the moderately susceptible barley double mutant line A89 (genotype: mlo5-ror1), which shows a papillae-based defence phenotype. Upon bombardment of leaf segments with PR-1b dsRNA and a GFP marker gene construct, Bgh slightly more frequently penetrated the plant cell wall of transformed epidermal cells relative to cells bombarded with human control dsRNA. We conclude that PR-1b contributes to penetration resistance to the powdery mildew fungus in barley. We also observed that PR-1b expression correlates with the production of H2O2 in responses to Bgh and Bipolaris sorokiniana and was induced upon infiltration of the H2O2 producing mixture of glucose and glucose oxidase.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley and wheat, caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a continual problem worldwide. Primarily, FHB reduces yield and quality, and results in the production of the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which can affect food safety. Identification of QTLs for FHB severity, DON level and related traits heading-date (HD) and plant-height (HT) with consistent effects across a set of environments, would provide the basis for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and potentially increase the efficiency of selection for resistance. A segregating population of 75 double-haploid lines, developed from the three-way cross Zhedar 2/ND9712//Foster, was used for genome mapping and FHB severity evaluation. A linkage map of 214 RFLP, SSR and AFLP markers was constructed. Phenotypic data were collected in replicated field trials from five environments in two growing seasons. The data were analyzed using MQTL software to detect quantitative trait locus (QTL) x environment (E) interactions. Because of the presence of QTL x E, the MQM procedure in MAPQTL was applied to identify QTLs in single environments. We identified nine QTLs for FHB severity and five for low DON. Many of the disease-related QTLs identified were coincident with FHB QTLs identified in previous studies. Only two of the QTLs identified in this study were consistent across all five environments, and both were Zhedar 2 specific. Five of the FHB QTLs were associated with HD, and two were associated with HT. Regions that appear to be promising candidates for MAS and further genetic analysis include the two FHB QTLs on chromosome 2H and one on 6H, which were also associated with low DON and later heading-date in multiple environments. This study provides a starting point for manipulating Zhedar 2-derived resistance by MAS in barley to develop cultivars that will show effective resistance under disease pressure.

AB One hundred and ninety three parental lines obtained from 26 countries for an international rice molecular breeding program were evaluated using 101 well-distributed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. An overall genetic diversity of 0.68 and an average of 6.3 alleles per locus were revealed, indicating a high level of genetic variation in these lines. Cluster analysis of the 193 accessions showed three major groups and nine subgroups. Group I corresponded to the classical indica subspecies, whereas groups II and III belong to the japonica subspecies. Indica and japonica differentiation accounted for only 6.5% of the total variation in the entire sample and 93.5% was due to within-subspecies diversity. Differentiation among eco-geographic regions accounted for 24% of the diversity within the subspecies. Larger amounts of the eco-geographical differentiation were resolved within japonica than within indica. The largest indica-japonica differentiation based on the single locus level was detected by markers on chromosomes 9 and 12, while the smallest differentiation was detected by markers on chromosomes 4 and 8. Furthermore, genetic differences at the single-locus and two-locus levels, as well as components due to allelic and gametic differentiation, were revealed between indica and japonica and among the main geographic regions. The multilocus analysis in genetic diversity showed a higher proportion of variation caused by predominant non-random associations of different loci within and among the classified subspecies and geographic subdivisions. The results suggest that selection for eco-geographical adaptation on multilocus associations was largely responsible for the maintenance of the extensive variation in the primary gene pool of rice.

AB The Yr5 gene confers resistance to all races of the wheat stripe rust pathogen [Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks. (P. s. tritici)] identified so far in the USA. Cosegregating resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers for Yr5 are available but their use requires skills in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and may not be polymorphic across various varieties. To develop better markers to be used in marker-assisted selection for the Yr5 resistance, sequence tagged site (STS) primers were designed on the basis of the sequences of RGAP markers Xwgp-18 (AY167598) from the spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS) and Xwgp-17 (AY167597) from the Yr5 near isogenic line (NIL) in the AVS background carrying the Yr5 gene from T. aestivum subsp. spelta (L.) Thell. cv. Album (TSA). Three sets of STS markers (two codominant and one dominant) were developed to amplify a region including a polymorphic 6-base pairs (bp) insertion-deletion (indel). The cosegregation of the STS markers with Yr5 was confirmed with 114 BC7:F-3 lines developed from the cross between AVS and TSA. The STS markers worked well in five out or 17 non-Yr5 wheat varieties, but the remaining varieties had a similar size of fragment to the Yr5 marker. Because the codominant STS markers were based on a 6-bp indel, they could not be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were then developed on the basis of a DpnII restriction site that is present in all non-Yr5 varieties and absent in the Yr5 NIL. The CAPS markers for the Yr5 NIL and non-Yr5 varieties can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The codominant STS markers are easier to score than the original RGAP markers. The CAPS markers are not only easier to score, but also can be used in crosses of an Yr5 donor with a much wider range of wheat germplasms. These markers should be valuable tools to accelerate the introgression of Yr5 into commercial cultivars and to combine Yr5 with other genes for durable resistance to stripe rust.

AB Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] cultivars derive from a narrow gene pool, and studies of genetic diversity in Pennisetum germplasm suggest promising opportunities for the use of undomesticated materials for improving pearl millet varieties. However, efficient utilization of wild germplasm will require effective DNA marker-based fingerprinting strategies for rapid assessment of genetic relationships. The present study aims at development and utilization of a collection of microsatellite (SSR, simple sequence repeat) markers for assessing the genetic diversity of 53 lines of millet. A small insert genomic library was screened with a (CT)(15) oligonucleotide probe. A total of 34 (CT)(n)-containing clones were identified, and specific primers were designed for 18 of these. Of 18 new microsatellites developed as a part of this work, 11 were used to estimate the genetic diversity, along with 19 from other sources. Cluster analysis by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) showed two major and eight minor clusters, suggesting that the millet germplasm could readily be distinguished by UPGMA. The coefficients of genetic distance among germplasm lines were high and averaged D = 0.60 (range 0.28-0.92). Genetic diversity averaged 0.38. These results demonstrated that genotypes with potential traits are maximally different from the cultivated gene pool and could readily he distinguished. Development and utilization of polymerase-chain-reaction-(PCR)-based markers such as SSRs is a valuable asset for estimating genetic diversity, the identification of unique genotypes as potentially important new sources of alleles for enhancing important characteristics, and analyzing the evolutionary and historical development of cultivars at the genomic level in pearl millet breeding programs.

AB A reciprocal chromosomal transposition was identified in several annual oilseed Brassica napus genotypes used as parents in crosses to biennial genotypes for genetic mapping studies. The transposition involved an exchange of interstitial homeologous regions on linkage groups N7 and N16, and its detection was made possible by the use of segregating populations of doubled haploid lines and codominant RFLP markers. RFLP probes detected pairs of homeologous loci on N7 and N16 for which the annual and biennial parents had identical alleles in regions expected to be homeologous. The existence of an interstitial reciprocal transposition was confirmed by cytological analysis of synaptonemal complexes of annual X biennial F-1 hybrids. Although it included approximately one-third of the physical length of the N7 and N16 chromosomes, few recombination events within the region were recovered in the progenies of the hybrids. Significantly higher seed yields were associated with the parental configurations of the rearrangement in segregating progenies. These progenies contained complete complements of homeologous chromosomes from the diploid progenitors of B. napus, and thus their higher seed yields provide evidence for the selective advantage of allopolyploidy through the fixation of intergenomic heterozygosity.

AB Factors influencing the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species have been widely investigated. These factors include manipulating Agrobacterium strains and plasmids, growth conditions for vir gene induction, plant genotype, inoculation and eo-culture conditions, and the selection agents and their application regime. We report here a novel physical parameter during co-culture, desiccation of plant cells or tissues post-Agrobacterium infection, which greatly enhances transfer DNA (T-DNA) delivery and increases stable transformation efficiency in wheat. Desiccation during co-culture dramatically suppressed Agrobacterium growth, which is one of the factors known to favor plant cell recovery. Osmotic and abscisic acid treatments and desiccation prior to inoculation did not have the same enhancement effect as desiccation during co-culture on T-DNA delivery in wheat. An efficient transformation protocol has been developed based on desiccation and is suitable for both paromomycin and glyphosate selection. Southern analysis showed approximately 67% of transgenic wheat plants received a single copy of the transgene.
