AB Achieving durable resistance to leaf rust (LR), caused by Puccinia triticina, in wheat has been one of the main objectives of breeding programs. Durability of LR resistance is considered to be associated with adult plant resistance (APR) genes that are quantitatively inherited and whose expression is largely influenced by environment. Our objective was to study the effects and interactions of APR genes Lr34, Lr68 and Sr2 on LR response in Uruguay using two BC1F6 populations ('LE2304*2/Parula' and 'ORL99192*2/Parula'). The experimental material was screened for LR in three artificially inoculated environments (La Estanzuela 2012 and 2013 and Young 2012). Linked molecular markers were used to detect the presence of the genes conferring resistance to LR. Gene Lr34 was fixed in the 'LE2304*2/Parula' population. Lr68+Sr2 resulted in a reduction of 79 % of the LR area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), while the presence of Lr68 alone resulted in a reduction of 51 %. In the 'ORL99192*2/Parula' population, the combined effect of Lr34+Lr68+Sr2 led to the highest reduction of LR AUDPC (73 %). Individually, Lr34 and Lr68 resulted in a reduction of the LR AUDPC of 14 and 50 %, respectively. Sr2 alone did not reduce LR AUDPC but enhanced the effect of either Lr34 or Lr68. Unlike previous reports Lr68 conferred a higher level of LR resistance than Lr34 in Uruguay.

AB Yellow (or stripe) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is an important wheat disease worldwide. The development of wheat cultivars with adult plant resistance (APR) has been given increasing emphasis in recent years because of the reputed durability of APR compared to all-stage resistance. Wheat landrace Caoxuan 5 showed a high level of APR in field nurseries from 2008 to 2014. Bulked segregant analysis using resistance gene analog polymorphism, simple sequence repeat and sequence-tagged site markers identified molecular markers linked to resistance genes. A total of 176 F-3 lines were evaluated for stripe rust response in field nurseries at two sites for 2 years. Broad sense heritability of APR in the population was estimated as 0.81. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) QYrcx.nafu-3BS and QYrcx.nafu-6AL conferring adult plant resistance and they explained 17.3-38.1 % and 9.7-19.8 % of the phenotypic variations, respectively. Based on molecular markers, both QTL appear to be different from previously identified stripe rust resistance genes. The resistance QTL and their molecular markers identified in Caoxuan 5 should be useful in breeding for stripe rust resistance.

AB Predicting wheat growth stages using ecophysiological models is of particular interest as it allows anticipating important agricultural managements. Numerous ecophysiological models exist but they need cultivar-specific parameterization, which is often costly and time consuming. The work presented here proposes a simple approach to predict wheat growth stages using the allelic composition of wheat cultivars. It relies on using the prediction of a modified version of the ARCWHEAT model for a well parameterized reference cultivar (Soissons) and the marker-based predicted deviation in days to the reference cultivar. First, the deviations to the reference cultivar Soissons for the beginning of stem elongation (87.30) and heading date (delta Z55) were calculated for a large panel of cultivars. Analysis of variance showed prominent genetic effects for delta Z30 and delta Z55 and possible genotype x environment interactions (G x E) for delta Z30. Genotypic means 6230 and delta Z55 were used in association genetics revealing 90 and 83 genetic markers associated to these traits, respectively. Multiple linear regression models predicting delta Z30 using 11 genetic markers (R-2= 76%) or delta Z55 using 17 markers (R-2 =85%) were obtained by a stepwise procedure. Marker PPD-D1 had the largest impact in both models. Finally, marker-based deviations added to the prediction for the reference cultivar Soissons allowed predicting Z30 or Z55 for a large independent validation dataset. The root mean square error of prediction for Z30 and Z55 using the approach proposed in this paper (6.8 and 4.7 days, respectively) was comparable to the one obtained using the conventional approach with cultivar-specific parameters values (6.5 and 4.1, respectively). The models proposed in this paper appeared sufficient in order to predict growth stages of cultivars which cannot be parameterized such as new cultivars coming out on the market. Moreover, genetic markers involved in the multiple linear regression models predicting delta Z30 and delta Z55 may provide interesting candidates to unravel new genes determining earliness in winter wheat.

SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS

DT Article
ID BREAD WHEAT; MAP; TRAITS; VALUES
AB Wheat yellow mosaic virus resistance of Madsen is governed by two complementary QTLs, Qym1 and Qym2 , located on chromosome arms 2DL and 3BS.
   Wheat yellow mosaic, caused by Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), is one of the most serious wheat diseases in East Asia. In this study, recombinant inbred lines (RILs, F-9) from a cross between cultivars Madsen (resistant) and Hokushin (susceptible) grown in a WYMV-infected nursery field were tested for the presence of WYMV in leaves by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and genotyped by using genome-wide molecular markers. Two major QTLs were detected: Qym1 located between Xgwm539 and Xgwm349 on chromosome 2DL and Qym2 located between Xbarc147 and Xwmc623 on chromosome 3BS. The resistance alleles for both QTLs originated from Madsen. The third QTL Qym3 located near Xwmc457 on chromosome 4D, where the resistant allele for this QTL originated from Hokushin. Although the Qym3 was rather minor, it was essential to complement Qym1 and Qym2 for complete avoidance of WYMV infection. Near-isogenic lines carrying the resistance QTLs were developed by repeated backcrosses using Madsen as the donor parent and Hokushin as the recurrent parent. The lines that were resistant to WYMV (as tested by ELISA) were homozygous for the Madsen alleles at both Qym1 and Qym2. Qym1 dominance was partial, whereas that of Qym2 was nearly complete. Qym1 was closely linked to Xwmc41; Qym2 was closely linked to Xwmc754. These markers will be useful in marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding for WYMV resistance; this study will facilitate cloning the WYMV resistance genes.

AB Selection for QLr.cau - 1AS (a major QTL detected in wheat for reducing leaf rust severity) based on the DNA marker gpw2246 was as effective as selection for Lr34 based on cssfr5.
   Leaf rust is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Utilization of slow-rusting resistance constitutes a strategy to sustainably control this disease. The American wheat cultivar Luke exhibits slow leaf-rusting resistance at the adult plant stage. The objectives of this study were to detect and validate QTL for the resistance in Luke. Three winter wheat populations were used, namely, 149 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Luke x Aquileja, 307 RILs from Luke x AQ24788-83, and 80 F-2:3 families selected from Lingxing66 x KA298. Aquileja and Lingxing66 are highly susceptible to leaf rust. AQ24788-83 shows high (susceptible) infection type but contains the slow-rusting gene Lr34 as diagnosed by the gene-specific marker cssfr5. KA298, an F-9 RIL selected from Luke x AQ24788-83, contains Lr34 and QLr.cau-1AS (a major QTL originated from Luke, this study). These wheats were evaluated for leaf rust in 12 field and greenhouse environments involving four locations and five seasons. Genotyping was done using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and diversity arrays technology markers. Of the detected QTLs, QLr.cau-1AS was significant consistently across all the genetic backgrounds, test environments, and likely a wide range of pathogen races. QLr.cau-1AS explained 22.3-55.2 % of leaf rust phenotypic variation, being comparable to Lr34 in effect size. A co-dominant SSR marker (gpw2246, http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml) was identified to be tightly linked to QLr.cau-1AS. Selection based on gpw2246 for QLr.cau-1AS was as effective as the selection based on cssfr5 for Lr34. QLr.cau-1AS will be helpful for increasing the genetic diversity of slow leaf-rusting resistance in wheat breeding programs.

AB By applying comparative genomics analyses, a high-density genetic linkage map of the Wax 1 ( W1 ) locus was constructed as a framework for map-based cloning.
   Glaucousness is described as the scattering effect of visible light from wax deposited on the cuticle of plant aerial organs. In wheat, the wax on leaves and stems is mainly controlled by two sets of genes: glaucousness loci (W1 and W2) and non-glaucousness loci (Iw1 and Iw2). Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that Wax1 (W1) is located on chromosome arm 2BS between markers Xgwm210 and Xbarc35. By applying comparative genomics analyses, colinearity genomic regions of the W1 locus on wheat 2BS were identified in Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 5, rice chromosome 4 and sorghum chromosome 6, respectively. Four STS markers were developed using the Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring 454 contig sequences and the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) survey sequences. W1 was mapped into a 0.93 cM genetic interval flanked by markers XWGGC3197 and XWGGC2484, which has synteny with genomic regions of 56.5 kb in Brachypodium, 390 kb in rice and 31.8 kb in sorghum. The fine genetic map can serve as a framework for chromosome landing, physical mapping and map-based cloning of the W1 in wheat.

Powdery mildew disease caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici can result in significant loss in both grain yield and quality in wheat. In this study, the wheat powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW170 locus located at the Triticum dicoccoides chromosome 2B short arm was further characterized by constructing and sequencing a BAC-based physical map contig covering a 0.3 cM genetic distance region (880 kb) and developing additional markers to delineate the resistance gene within a 0.16 cM genetic interval (372 kb). Comparative analyses of the T. dicoccoides 2BS region with the orthologous Aegilops tauschii 2DS region showed great gene colinearity, including the structure organization of both types of RGA1/2-like and RPS2-like resistance genes. Comparative analyses with the orthologous regions from Brachypodium and rice genomes revealed considerable dynamic evolutionary changes that have re-shaped this MlIW170 region in the wheat genome, resulting in a high number of non-syntenic genes including resistance-related genes. This result might reflect the rapid evolution in R-gene regions. Phylogenetic analysis on these resistance-related gene sequences indicated the duplication of these genes in the MlIW170 region, occurred before the separation of the wheat B and D genomes.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most widespread diseases of wheat worldwide. Resistance breeding is constantly pursued for decades to tackle the variations of prevalent Pst races. Zhongliang 16 has wide adaptability, strong resistance to abiotic stresses, excellent biological characteristics, and higher resistance to stripe rust. In this study, Zhongliang 16 was crossed with a susceptible genotype, Mingxian 169, to identify the resistance gene(s). Seedlings of the parents, F-1, F-2, F-2:3, and BC1 progenies were tested for resistance with Chinese Pst race CYR29 and CYR30 in greenhouse conditions. Zhongliang 16 possessed different dominant genes for resistance to each race, temporarily designated as Yrzhong16-1 and Yrzhong16-2. Yrzhong16-1 conferring resistance to CYR29 was flanked by Xbarc212 and Xwmc177 on the short arm of 2A at genetic distances of 5.4 and 6.6 cM; and Yrzhong16-2 conferring resistance to CYR30 was flanked by Xgwm644 and Xbarc95 on the long arm of 7B at genetic distances of 2.3 and 3.5 cM, respectively. Chromosomal locations and race and allelism tests indicated that the two genes are different from previously reported stripe rust resistance genes. These genes and their flanking markers should be useful in marker assisted selection-breeding programs against wheat stripe rust. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying and mobilizing useful genetic variation from germplasm banks to breeding programs is an important strategy for sustaining crop genetic improvement. The molecular diversity of 1,423 spring bread wheat accessions representing major global production environments was investigated using high quality genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) loci, and gene-based markers for various adaptive and quality traits. Mean diversity index (DI) estimates revealed synthetic hexaploids to be genetically more diverse (DI = 0.284) than elites (DI = 0.267) and landraces (DI = 0.245). GBS markers discovered thousands of new SNP variations in the landraces which were well known to be adapted to drought (1273 novel GBS SNPs) and heat (4473 novel GBS SNPs) stress environments. This may open new avenues for pre-breeding by enriching the elite germplasm with novel alleles for drought and heat tolerance. Furthermore, new allelic variation for vernalization and glutenin genes was also identified from 47 landraces originating from Iraq, Iran, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The information generated in the study has been utilized to select 200 diverse gene bank accessions to harness their potential in pre-breeding and for allele mining of candidate genes for drought and heat stress tolerance, thus channeling novel variation into breeding pipelines. This research is part of CIMMYT's ongoing 'Seeds of Discovery' project visioning towards the development of high yielding wheat varieties that address future challenges from climate change.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has been cultivated for human consumption for millennia. However, most North Americans do not regularly consume barley as a foodstuff. In the last decade, there has been renewed interest in barley production for human consumption. A number of quality traits are used to estimate nutritional value and are useful for food processing. These include beta-glucan, grain protein, kernel hardness, solvent retention capacity (SRC), and hull type. The Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the US is a high-yielding region that has a reputation for setting dietary and nutritional trends. However, there are currently no winter food barleys adapted to this area. To determine the potential suitability of winter growth habits for food barley production in the PNW, we developed and tested 14 advanced lines. The germplasm was developed via marker-assisted and phenotypic selection and included hulled lines with waxy starch and hull-less lines with normal starch. Agronomic and food quality traits were measured on samples from three representative environments (dryland, irrigated, and high rainfall) over a 2-yr period allowing for assessment of performance within and across locations, as well as genotype x environment interaction. Lines with waxy starch had significantly higher levels of. beta-glucan, harder kernels, and higher water retention capacity. Hull-less lines had, on average, slightly lower yields than hulled lines, with an average difference of 105 kg ha(-1). Our future food barley variety development will focus exclusively on hull-less types because of the simplified processing and consumer interest in the nutritional benefits of whole grain.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the devastating diseases of small grain crops, including barley and wheat. Breeding for resistance is one of the best and ecofriendly strategies to manage the FHB. However, the existing methods used for screening genotypes, both under field and greenhouse conditions, often resulted in high experimental error, leading to inconsistent ranking of genotypes over years. In the postgenomic era, precise assessment of resistance is crucial to identify candidate genes. Here, we report a pathogen inoculation procedure and a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based protocol for the quantification and discrimination of quantitative resistance among barley and wheat genotypes to FHB. Using Fusarium specific primer pair Tri6_10, for the trichothecene biosynthetic cluster (Tri6) gene, we successfully quantified the relative fungal biomass in both spikelets and rachis. A qPCR of spikelets and rachis collected on 6 dpi, from inoculated three alternate spikelet regions, discriminated resistance with less experimental error than those based on the proportion of spikelets diseased (PSD) at 9 dpi. This method can be applied for medium to high-throughput barley and wheat breeding programmes to discriminate quantitative resistance among genotypes against FHB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lutein is a naturally occurring plant carotenoid compound that is also an important micro-nutrient for humans. While the biosynthesis of lutein in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is well understood, in contrast, there is little information on the mechanism or the genetic control involved in conversion of lutein to lutein esters during storage of wheat grain. The purpose of this research was to investigate the genetic control of lutein ester formation in wheat.
   Lutein esterification varied between accessions of bread wheat, some related species and even grain tissues. A single locus controlling lutein esterification (designated Lute) was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 7D using a mapping population derived from zero-ester and high-ester parents. A GDSL-like lipase gene was identified in a syntenic region of the rice genome and wheat sequences with similarity to that gene were genetically mapped at the same position as Lute.
   Since lutein esters seem to be more stable than free lutein, improved understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of lutein esterification could be useful for optimising the retention of lutein during the storage, handling and processing of wheat and other products that contain this important micronutrient (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In wheat, exotic genotypes harbor a broad range of spike-related traits, and can be used as a source of new genes for germplasm enhancement in wheat breeding programs. In the present study, a population of 163 recombinant inbred lines was derived from a cross between an elite line (WCB414) and an exotic line (WCB617) with branched spike (supernumerary spikelet; SS) head morphology. The population was evaluated over four to six environments to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nine spike-related traits and 10 agronomic traits. A genetic map consisting of 939 diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers was constructed. Composite interval mapping identified a total of 143 QTL located on 17 different wheat chromosomes and included 33 consistent and definitive QTL. The amount of phenotype variation explained (PVE) by individual QTL ranged from 0.61 to 91.8%. One major QTL for glume pubescence was located in a QTL-rich region on the short arm of chromosome 1A, where loci for other traits such as for kernels per spike (KS) and spike length (SL) were also identified. Similarly, a cluster of QTL associated with yield-related, agronomic and spike-related traits contributing up to 40.3% of PVE was found on the short arm of chromosome 2D, in the vicinity of a major QTL for SS-related traits. Consistent and major QTL identified in the present study may be useful in markerassisted breeding programs to facilitate transfer of desirable alleles into other germplasm. Desirable QTL alleles were also contributed by the exotic line, suggesting the possibility of enriching the breeding germplasm with alleles from SS genotypes.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., is one of the most widespread diseases of wheat and breeding for resistance is one of the most effective methods of control. Lr16 is a wheat leaf rust resistance gene (R-gene) that provides resistance at both the seedling and adult stages. Simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been used to map Lr16 to the distal end of chromosome 2B. The objectives of this study were to use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and in silico subtraction to identify new R-gene analogs (RGAs) and use them as Lr16 markers. RNA was isolated from the susceptible wheat cultivar Thatcher (Tc) and the resistant Tc isolines TcLr10, TcLr16, TcLr21, and sequenced using Illumina technology. Using in silico subtraction, sequences from the resistant Tc isolines were aligned to a Tc reference expressed sequence tag (EST) set. Sequences not aligning to the Tc reference were assembled into contigs and analyzed using BLASTx to determine putative gene functions. Primer pairs were designed for 181 RGA sequences, of which, 137 amplified in at least one of the parents. A mapping population was developed with 165 F-2 lines from a cross between the rust-susceptible cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) and TcLr16. Two RGA markers XTaLr16_RGA266585 and XTaLr16_RGA22128 were identified that mapped proximally 1.2 and 23.8 cM from Lr16, respectively. Three SSR markers Xwmc764, Xwmc661, and Xbarc35 mapped between these two RGA markers at distances of 5.0, 10.9, and 16.1 cM from Lr16, respectively. In silico subtraction is an effective technique for isolating RGAs linked to R-genes of interest.

AB The partial rust resistance genes Lr34 and Sr2 have been used extensively in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement, as they confer exceptional durability. Interestingly, the resistance of Lr34 is associated with the expression of leaf tip necrosis (LTN) and Sr2 with pseudo-black chaff (PBC). Genome-wide association mapping using CIMMYT's stem rust resistance screening nursery (SRRSN) wheat lines was done to identify genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers linked to LTN and PBC. Phenotyping for these traits was done in Ithaca, New York (fall 2011); Njoro, Kenya (main and off-seasons, 2012), and Wellington, India (winter, 2013). Using the mixed linear model (MLM), 18 GBS markers were significantly associated with LTN. While some markers were linked to loci where the durable leaf rust resistance genes Lr34 (7DS), Lr46 (1BL), and Lr68 (7BL) were mapped, significant associations were also detected with other loci on 2BL, 5B, 3BS, 4BS, and 7BS. Twelve GBS markers linked to the Sr2 locus (3BS) and loci on 2DS, 4AL, and 7DS were significantly associated with PBC. This study provides insight into the complex genetic control of LTN and PBC. Further efforts to validate and study these loci might aid in determining the nature of their association with durable resistance.

AB Assembly of the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genome is complicated by its large size (5.1 Gb) and proportion of repetitive elements (84%). This process is facilitated by high resolution maps for aligning bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs along chromosomes. Available genetic maps, however, do not provide accurate information on the physical position of a large portion of the genome located in recombination-poor regions. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping is an alternative approach, which is based on radiation-induced deletions along the length of chromosomes. In this study, the first RH map for barley chromosome 3H was developed. In total, 373 in vivo RH lines were generated by irradiating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-barley chromosome 3H addition lines and crossing them to a normal wheat cultivar. Each RH informative line (containing deletions) had, on average, three deletions. The induced deletion size varied from 36.58 Kb to 576.00 Mb, with an average length of 52.42 Mb. This initial chromosome 3H radiation hybrid (3H-RH) map had a 9.53 x higher resolution than an analogous genetic map, reaching a maximum of >262.40 x resolution in regions around the centromere. The final RH map was 3066.1 cR in length, with a 0.76 Mb resolution. It was estimated that the map resolution can be improved to an average of 30.34 Kb by saturating the 3H-RH map with molecular markers. The generated RH panel enabled alignment of BAC and sequenced contigs as small as 1.50 Kb in size. The high resolution and the coverage of poor-recombination regions make RH maps an ideal resource for barley genome assembly, as well as other genetic studies.

AB Genetic diversity represents the fundamental key to breeding success, providing the basis for breeders to select varieties with constantly improving yield performance. On the other hand, strong selection during domestication and breeding have eliminated considerable genetic diversity in the breeding pools of major crops, causing erosion of genetic potential for adaptation to emerging challenges like climate change. High-throughput genomic technologies can address this dilemma by providing detailed knowledge to characterize and replenish genetic diversity in breeding programs. In hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the staple food for 35% of the world's population, bottlenecks during allopolyploidisation followed by strong artificial selection have considerably narrowed diversity to the extent that yields in many regions appear to be unexpectedly stagnating. In this study, we used a 90,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) wheat genotyping array to assay high-frequency, polymorphic SNP markers in 460 accessions representing different phenological diversity groups from Asian, Australian, European, and North American bread wheat breeding materials. Detailed analysis of subgroup diversity at the chromosome and subgenome scale revealed highly distinct patterns of conserved linkage disequilibrium between different gene pools. The data enable identification of genome regions in most need of rejuvenation with novel diversity and provide a high-resolution molecular basis for genomic-assisted introgression of new variation into chromosome segments surrounding directionally selected metaloci conferring important adaptation and quality traits.

AB Rice amylose content (AC) is a key determinant for grain end-use quality attributes. The base substitution ((G -> T) at +1 loci of the first intron (In1) of Waxy (Wx), a major gene controlling AC in rice, results in decreased AC. A new SNP typing method of Wx In1 based on polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP) was reported here: first its practicability was confirmed by 23 varieties with known SNP and AC; and then the segregation ratio at target SNP loci were checked and it fitted well for 1: 2: 1 single gene segregation; at last SNP typing and AC assay with 150 mini core collections (MCC) in China showed that average AC of 53 G type varieties (22.5%) was significantly higher than that of 97 T type varieties (13.7%) (p < 0.01) and the target SNP loci explained 77.8% AC variation. So this method could be used to estimate AC of rice variety roughly or in marker-assisted breeding, that is, using variety with known and desired AC as Wx allele donor parent and aided with crossbreed, backcross and marker-assisted selection (MAS) reported here, rice breeders could improve AC of varieties with comprehensively excellent performance to meet special end-products.

AB The goal of this work was to establish a transformation pipeline for upland Curinga rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) with bar gene selection employing bialaphos and phosphinothricin as selection agents. The following genes of interest: AtNCED3, Lsi1, GLU2, LEW2, PLD-alpha, DA1, TOR, AVP1, and Rubisco were cloned into the binary vector p7i2x-Ubi and were transferred into Agrobacterium strain EHA 105. Embryogenic calli derived from the mature embryos were transformed, and transgenic cells and shoots were selected on the medium supplemented with bialaphos or phosphinothricin (PPT) using a stepwise selection scheme. Molecular analyses were established using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot for the bar gene and the NOS terminator. Overall, 273 putative transgenic plants were analyzed by Southern blot with 134 events identified. In total, 77 events had a single copy of the transgene integrated in the plant genome while 29 events had two copies. We tested backbone integration in 101 transgenic plants from all constructs and found 60 transgenic plants having no additional sequence integrated in the plant genome. The bar gene activity was evaluated by the chlorophenol red test and the leaf painting test using phosphinothricin with several transgenic plants. The majority of T0 plants carrying the single copy of transgene produced T1 seeds in the screen house.

AB Longer coleoptile is a desirable trait in wheat for sowing under drought stress environments with moisture availability in the deeper layers of the soil. In the present study, WL711/C306 wheat RIL population and the parents were phenotyped for coleoptile length under deep sowing conditions in the field and plant growth chamber. C306, a tall traditional cultivar had longer coleoptile compared to the semi dwarf parent WL711 carrying Rht-B1b gene. The RIL population showed considerable variation, normal distribution and transgressive segregation for coleoptile length under field and controlled environment conditions. The genetic linkage map of WL711/C306 RIL population was constructed comprising of 346 markers. The total map distance was 4,526.8 cM with an averaged interval of 12.9 cM between the adjacent markers. Major novel consistent QTLs for coleoptile length were identified on 4BS, co-located with the Rht-B1b gene and on 3BS. Also major QTL was identified on chromosome 3BL for coleoptile length explaining up to 12.4 % of phenotypic variation. On comparison with the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA sequences syntenic to wheat chromosome 4BS and 3BS, two candidate genes were identified namely gibberellin C-20 oxidase 1 and alpha-Expansin. These genes play a role in cell wall expansion in the young expanding tissue in the coleoptile. QTLs qCL.4B.1 and qCL.3B.1 emerge to be important for coleoptile length in the WL711/C306 RIL population suggesting their potential value for use in marker assisted selection after validation for longer coleoptile length and improved establishment.

AB A set of NILs carrying major blast resistance genes in a Basmati rice variety has been developed. Also, the efficacy of pyramids over monogenic NILs against rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae has been demonstrated.
   Productivity and quality of Basmati rice is severely affected by rice blast disease. Major genes and QTLs conferring resistance to blast have been reported only in non-Basmati rice germplasm. Here, we report incorporation of seven blast resistance genes from the donor lines DHMASQ164-2a (Pi54, Pi1, Pita), IRBLz5-CA (Pi2), IRBLb-B (Pib), IRBL5-M (Pi5) and IRBL9-W (Pi9) into the genetic background of an elite Basmati rice variety Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1). A total of 36 near-isogenic lines (NILs) comprising of 14 monogenic, 16 two-gene pyramids and six three-gene pyramids were developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Foreground, recombinant and background selection was used to identify the plants with target gene(s), minimize the linkage drag and increase the recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery (93.5-98.6 %), respectively, in the NILs. Comparative analysis performed using 50,051 SNPs and 500 SSR markers revealed that the SNPs provided better insight into the RPG recovery. Most of the monogenic NILs showed comparable performance in yield and quality, concomitantly, Pusa1637-18-7-6-20 (Pi9), was significantly superior in yield and stable across four different environments as compared to recurrent parent (RP) PB1. Further, among the pyramids, Pusa1930-12-6 (Pi2+Pi5) showed significantly higher yield and Pusa1633-7-8-53-6-8 (Pi54+Pi1+Pita) was superior in cooking quality as compared to RP PB1. The NILs carrying gene Pi9 were found to be the most effective against the concoction of virulent races predominant in the hotspot locations for blast disease. Conversely, when analyzed under artificial inoculation, three-gene pyramids expressed enhanced resistance as compared to the two-gene and monogenic NILs.

AB Identified DArT and SNP markers including a first reported QTL on 3AS, validated large effect APR on 3BS. The different genes can be used to incorporate stripe resistance in cultivated varieties.
   Stripe rust [yellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst)] is a serious disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum). This study employed genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) to identify markers linked to stripe rust resistance genes using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArTA (R)) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Infinium 9K assays in 200 ICARDA wheat genotypes, phenotyped for seedling and adult plant resistance in two sites over two growing seasons in Syria. Only 25.8 % of the genotypes showed resistance at seedling stage while about 33 and 44 % showed moderate resistance and resistance response, respectively. Mixed-linear model adjusted for false discovery rate at p < 0.05 identified 12 DArT and 29 SNP markers on chromosome arms 3AS, 3AL, 1AL, 2AL, 2BS, 2BL, 3BS, 3BL, 5BL, 6AL, and 7DS significantly linked to Pst resistance genes. Of these, the locus on 3AS has not been previously reported to confer resistance to stripe rust in wheat. The QTL on 3AS, 3AL, 1AL, 2AL, and 2BS were effective at seedling and adult plant growth stages while those on 3BS, 3BL, 5BL, 6AL and 7DS were effective at adult plant stage. The 3BS QTL was validated in Cham-6 x Cham-8 recombinant inbred line population; composite interval analysis identified a stripe resistance QTL flanked by the DArT marker, wPt-798970, contributed by Cham-6 parent which accounted for 31.2 % of the phenotypic variation. The DArT marker "wPt-798970" lies 1.6 cM away from the 3BS QTL detected within GWAM. Epistatic interactions were also investigated; only the QTL on 1AL, 3AS and 6AL exhibited interactions with other loci. These results suggest that GWAM can be an effective approach for identifying and improving resistance to stripe rust in wheat.

AB Gamma radiation induced a series of structural aberrations involving Thinopyrum bessarabicum chromosome 4J. The aberrations allowed for deletion mapping of 101 4J-specific markers and fine mapping of blue-grained gene BaThb.
   Irradiation can induce translocations and deletions to assist physically locating genes and markers on chromosomes. In this study, a 12-Gy dosage of Co-60-gamma was applied to pollen and eggs of a wheat (Triticum aestivum) landrace Chinese Spring (CS)-Thinopyrum bessarabicum chromosome 4J disomic addition line (DA4J), and the gametes from irradiated plants were fertilized with normal CS eggs or pollen to produce M-1 seeds. Based on genomic in situ hybridization analysis of 261 M-1 plants, we identified 74 lines carrying structural aberrations involving chromosome 4J with the higher aberration rate in treated pollen (31.2 %) than in the treated eggs (21.3 %). We further identified 43 (53.8 %) lines with structural aberrations on chromosome 4J by analyzing another 80 M-1 plants with 74 4J-specific markers, indicating that combining molecular and cytological methods was more efficient for detecting chromosome aberrations. Marker analysis thus was performed prior to cytogenetic identification on M-2-M-4 seeds to detect chromosome structural aberrations. Sixty-eight M-3 lines with structural aberrations on chromosome 4J and six previously obtained chromosome 4J alien lines were then analyzed using 101 chromosome 4J-specific markers. After combining marker results with chromosome aberrations in each line, chromosome 4J was physically divided into 24 segmental blocks with 7 in the short arm and 17 in the long arm. The blue-grained gene BaThb was further mapped into the region corresponding to block 4JL-11. The chromosome aberrations and the physical map developed in this research provide useful stocks and tools for introgression of genes on chromosome 4J into wheat.

AB Making use of wheat chromosomal resources, we developed 11 gene-associated markers for the region of interest, which allowed reducing gene interval and spanning it by four BAC clones.
   Positional gene cloning and targeted marker development in bread wheat are hampered by high complexity and polyploidy of its nuclear genome. Aiming to clone a Russian wheat aphid resistance gene Dn2401 located on wheat chromosome arm 7DS, we have developed a strategy overcoming problems due to polyploidy and enabling efficient development of gene-associated markers from the region of interest. We employed information gathered by GenomeZipper, a synteny-based tool combining sequence data of rice, Brachypodium, sorghum and barley, and took advantage of a high-density linkage map of Aegilops tauschii. To ensure genome- and locus-specificity of markers, we made use of survey sequence assemblies of isolated wheat chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D. Despite the low level of polymorphism of the wheat D subgenome, our approach allowed us to add in an efficient and cost-effective manner 11 new gene-associated markers in the Dn2401 region and narrow down the target interval to 0.83 cM. Screening 7DS-specific BAC library with the flanking markers revealed a contig of four BAC clones that span the Dn2401 region in wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring'. With the availability of sequence assemblies and GenomeZippers for each of the wheat chromosome arms, the proposed strategy can be applied for focused marker development in any region of the wheat genome.

AB A locus of major effect for stem rust resistance, effective against Ug99 and possibly a target of a suppressor on chromosome arm 7DL in wheat cultivar Canthatch, was mapped to 7AL.
   Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is responsible for major production losses around the world. The development of resistant cultivars is an effective and environmentally friendly way to manage the disease, but outbreaks can occur when new pathogen races overcome the existing host resistance genes. Ug99 (race TTKSK) and related Pgt races are virulent to the majority of existing cultivars, which presents a potential threat to global wheat production. The hexaploid wheat cultivar Canthatch has long been known to carry a suppressor of stem rust resistance on chromosome arm 7DL. Multiple "non-suppressor" mutants of Canthatch are reported to have gained resistance to Pgt races, including Ug99 (TTKSK) and related races TTKST and TTTSK. To genetically map the suppressor locus, a mapping population was developed from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Columbus, thought to possess the suppressor, and Columbus-NS766, a resistant, near-isogenic line believed to contain a mutant non-suppressor allele introgressed from Canthatch. Genetic mapping using a 9K SNP genotyping assay and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) on bulked segregants led to the identification of markers linked to a locus of stem rust resistance. Surprisingly, genomic sequence information revealed the markers to be located on 7AL instead of 7DL, indicating that the resistance phenotype was due to a new resistance locus, rather than the inactivated suppressor. We suggest that the 7AL locus of resistance is most likely suppressed by the 7DL suppressor.

AB Pyramiding QTL for FHB resistance from multiple sources presents an opportunity to enhance the Fhb1 derived resistance of elite spring wheat germplasm. Conventionally, pyramiding QTL using a marker assisted-selection approach requires preliminary mapping studies to identify the resistance QTL from each parental line and validation studies to assess the QTL effects in multiple genetic backgrounds. This study evaluates IBD-based linkage analysis for the purpose of mapping, validation and marker-assisted pyramiding of resistance QTL simultaneously in breeding populations. Eight hundred and twenty nine segregating F-1 progeny from 43 four-way crosses among multiple sources of resistance were evaluated in the greenhouse and in field-based progeny tests. IBD-based linkage analysis was conducted using a mixed model extension of Haseman-Elston sib-pair regression. QTL for FHB resistance were identified on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3B and 7B, cumulatively explaining 18-21 % of the variance for FHB severity in different evaluations. The QTL on chromosome 3B corresponded with Fhb1, and the QTL on chromosomes 2B and 7B are corroborated by previous mapping studies. The QTL mapped to chromosome 2A potentially represents a novel source of resistance derived from elite North American spring wheat germplasm. Marker haplotypes for these QTL regions are being used for marker-assisted selection of resistance alleles in subsequent generations of these breeding populations.

AB Wheatgrass Thinopyrum intermedium (Host), or Agropyron intermedium (Host) (2n = 42; genome formula, EEE(st)E(st)StSt) is one of the most valuable sources of highly effective resistance genes in wheat breeding. Bread wheat cultivars Tulaikovskaya 5, Tulaikovskaya 10, and Tulaikovskaya 100 derived from wheat-Thinopyrum crosses are highly resistant to leaf rust and powdery mildew, and moderately resistant to stem and yellow rust. C-banding, in situ hybridization, and assays with PLUG and SSR markers have demonstrated that wheat chromosome 6D in all three cultivars is substituted by the Th. intermedium homoeologous chromosome, 6Ai. This chromosome was designated 6Ai#2, because it differs from the earlier described homoeologous chromosome 6Ai#1. In situ hybridization with Pseudoroegneria spicata and Dasypyrum villosum genomic DNAs has allowed chromosome 6Ai#2 to be assigned to the E (=J) subgenome. Chromosome 6Ai#2 remained intact over long-term breeding efforts. Tests of leaf rust resistance of in F-2 and F-3 populations from a cross of a leaf rust-susceptible cultivar with Tulaikovskaya 10 has demonstrated that chromosome 6Ai#2 carries at least one gene locus for leaf rust resistance. This locus was designated Lr6Ai#2. It must be different from the known gene locus Lr38, located on the long arm of chromosome 7Ai#2 and now present in many translocation variants in bread wheat. The effect of a chromosome from the Th. intermedium subgenome E on resistance to powdery mildew, stem and yellow rust in Tulaikovskaya 5, Tulaikovskaya 10, and Tulaikovskaya 100 is discussed.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most abundant mycotoxins worldwide and mostly detected in cereals and grains. As such, DON poses a risk for many adverse health effects to human and animals. In particular, immune cells are very sensitive to DON, with the initiating step leading to toxicity being a binding to the eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunit and induction of ribotoxic stress. The present study aimed to: (1) extend insight into the mechanism of action (MOA) of DON in immune cells; and (2) understand why immune cells are more sensitive to DON than most other cell types. Previously published microarray studies have described the effects of DON on immune cells. To build upon these findings, here, immunocytological and biochemical studies were performed using human T-lymphocyte Jurkat cells that were exposed for 3 h to 0.5 mu M DON. Induction of ER stress by DON was confirmed by immunocytology demonstrating increased protein expression of two major ER stress markers ATF3 and DDIT3. T-cell activation was confirmed by induction of phosphorylation of protein kinases JNK and AKT, activation of NF-kappa B (p65), and increased expression of NFAT target gene NUR77; each of these are known inducers of the T-cell activation response. Induction of an oxidative stress response was also confirmed by monitoring the nuclear translocation of major oxidative stress markers NRF2 and KEAP1, as well as by changes (i.e. decreases) in cell levels of reduced glutathione. Lastly, this study showed that DON induced cleavage of caspase-3, an event known to mediate apoptosis. Taken together, these results allowed us to formulate a potential mechanism of action of DON in immune cells, i.e. binding to eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunit -> ribotoxic stress -> ER stress -> calcium release from the ER into cytoplasm -> T-cell activation and oxidative stress -> apoptosis. It is proposed that immune cells are more sensitive to DON than other cell types due to the induction of a T-cell activation response by increased intracellular calcium levels.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most abundant DNA sequence variation present in plant genomes. Here, we report the design and validation of a unique genic-SNP genotyping chip for genetic and evolutionary studies as well as molecular breeding applications in rice. The chip incorporates 50,051 SNPs from 18,980 different genes spanning 12 rice chromosomes, including 3,710 single-copy (SC) genes conserved between wheat and rice, 14,959 SC genes unique to rice, 194 agronomically important cloned rice genes and 117 multi-copy rice genes. Assays with this chip showed high success rate and reproducibility because of the SC gene based array with no sequence redundancy and cross-hybridisation problems. The usefulness of the chip in genetic diversity and phylogenetic studies of cultivated and wild rice germplasm was demonstrated. Furthermore, its efficacy was validated for analysing background recovery in improved mega rice varieties with submergence tolerance developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding.

AB Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, which causes wheat powdery mildew, is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that can easily genetically adapt to its host plant. Understanding the virulence structure of and genetic variations in this pathogen is essential for disease control and for breeding resistance to wheat powdery mildew. This study investigated 17 pathogenic populations in Sichuan, China and classified 109 isolates into two distinct groups based on pathogenicity analysis: high virulence (HV, 92 isolates) and low virulence (LV, 17 isolates). Populations from Yibin (Southern region), Xichang (Western region), and Meishan (Middle region) showed lower virulence frequencies than populations from other regions. Many of the previously known resistance genes did not confer resistance in this study. The resistance gene Pm21 displayed an immune response to pathogenic challenge with all populations in Sichuan, and Pm13, Pm5b, Pm2+6, and PmXBD maintained resistance. AMOVA revealed significantly higher levels of variation within populations and lower levels of variation among populations within regions. High levels of gene flow were detected among populations in the four regions. Closely related populations within each region were distinguished by cluster analyses using ISSR and SRAP alleles. Both ISSR and SRAP allele profiling analyses revealed high levels of genetic diversity among pathogenic populations in Sichuan. Although ISSR and SRAP profiling analysis showed similar resolutions, the SRAP alleles appeared to be more informative. We did not detect any significant association between these alleles and the virulence or pathogenicity of the pathogen. Our results suggest that ISSR and SRAP alleles are more efficient for the characterization of small or closely related populations versus distantly related populations.

AB TaGW2 is an orthologue of rice gene OsGW2, which encodes E3 RING ubiquitin ligase and controls the grain size in rice. In wheat, three copies of TaGW2 have been identified and mapped on wheat homoeologous group 6 viz. TaGW2-6A, TaGW2-6B and TaGW2-6D. In the present study, using as many as 207 Indian wheat genotypes, we identified four SNPs including two novel SNPs (SNP-988 and SNP-494) in the promoter sequence of TaGW2-6A. All the four SNPs were G/A or A/G substitutions (transitions). Out of the four SNPs, SNP-494 was causal, since it was found associated with grain weight. The mean TGW (41.1 g) of genotypes with the allele SNP-494_A was significantly higher than mean TGW (38.6 g) of genotypes with the allele SNP-494_G. SNP-494 also regulates the expression of TaGW2-6Aso that the wheat genotypes with SNP-494_G have higher expression and lower TGW and the genotypes with SNP-494_A have lower expression but higher TGW. Besides, SNP-494 was also found associated with grain length-width ratio, awn length, spike length, grain protein content, peduncle length and plant height. This suggested that gene TaGW2-6A not only controls grain size, but also controls other agronomic traits. In the promoter region, SNP-494 was present in 'CGCG' motif that plays an important role in Ca2+/calmodulin mediated regulation of genes. A user-friendly CAPS marker was also developed to identify the desirable allele of causal SNP (SNP-494) for use in marker-assisted selection for improvement of grain weight in wheat. Using four SNPs, five haplotypes were identified; of these, Hap_5 (G_A_G_A) was found to be a desirable haplotype having significantly higher grain weight (41.13g) relative to other four haplotypes (36.33-39.16 g).

AB Background: The substantially large bread wheat genome, organized into highly similar three sub-genomes, renders genomic research challenging. The construction of BAC-based physical maps of individual chromosomes reduces the complexity of this allohexaploid genome, enables elucidation of gene space and evolutionary relationships, provides tools for map-based cloning, and serves as a framework for reference sequencing efforts. In this study, we constructed the first comprehensive physical map of wheat chromosome arm 5DS, thereby exploring its gene space organization and evolution.
   Results: The physical map of 5DS was comprised of 164 contigs, of which 45 were organized into 21 supercontigs, covering 176 Mb with an N50 value of 2,173 kb. Fifty-eight of the contigs were larger than 1 Mb, with the largest contig spanning 6,649 kb. A total of 1,864 molecular markers were assigned to the map at a density of 10.5 markers/Mb, anchoring 100 of the 120 contigs (>5 clones) that constitute similar to 95 % of the cumulative length of the map. Ordering of 80 contigs along the deletion bins of chromosome arm 5DS revealed small-scale breaks in syntenic blocks. Analysis of the gene space of 5DS suggested an increasing gradient of genes organized in islands towards the telomere, with the highest gene density of 5.17 genes/Mb in the 0.67-0.78 deletion bin, 1.4 to 1.6 times that of all other bins.
   Conclusions: Here, we provide a chromosome-specific view into the organization and evolution of the D genome of bread wheat, in comparison to one of its ancestors, revealing recent genome rearrangements. The high-quality physical map constructed in this study paves the way for the assembly of a reference sequence, from which breeding efforts will greatly benefit.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the world. The Sichuan Basin is one of the most important regions of wheat production and stripe rust epidemics in China. Stripe rust resistance gene Yr26 (the same gene as Yr24) has been widely used in wheat breeding programs and in many cultivars grown in this region since the gene was discovered in the early 1990s. Virulence to Yr26 has increased in frequency since its first detection in 2008. The objective of this study was to assess the vulnerability of the wheat cultivars and breeding lines in the Sichuan Basin to Yr26-virulent races. In total, 85 wheat accessions were tested with Yr26-avirulent races CYR32, CYR33, and Su11-4 and two Yr26-virulent races, V26/CM42 and V26/Gui22. DNA markers for Yr26 were used to determine the presence and absence of Yr26 in the wheat accessions. Of the 85 wheat accessions, only 5 were resistant and 19 susceptible to all races tested, and the remaining 61 were resistant to at least one or more races tested in seedling stage. In all, 65 (76.5%) accessions were susceptible to the emerging Yr26-virulent race V26/Gui22. In field tests, susceptible accessions increased from 31.8% in a nursery inoculated with predominant and Yr26-avirulent races to 61.2% in the nursery inoculated with the predominant races mixed with V26/Gui22. Based on the results of the molecular marker and race tests, 33 (38.8%) accessions were determined to have Yr26, showing that the Yr26 virulence is a major threat to wheat production in the Sichuan Basin and potentially in other regions of China.

AB Many pathogenic fungi are genetically tractable. Analysis of their cellular organization and invasion mechanisms underpinning virulence determinants profits from exploiting such molecular tools as fluorescent fusion proteins or conditional mutant protein alleles. Generation of these tools requires efficient cloning methods, as vector construction is often a rate-limiting step. Here, we introduce an efficient yeast recombination-based cloning (YRBC) method to construct vectors for the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This method is of low cost and avoids dependency on the availability of restriction enzyme sites in the DNA sequence, as needed in more conventional restriction/ligation-based cloning procedures. Furthermore, YRBC avoids modification of the DNA of interest, indeed this potential risk limits the use of site-specific recombination systems, such as Gateway cloning. Instead, in YRBC, multiple DNA fragments, with 30 bp overlap sequences, are transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereupon homologous recombination generates the vector in a single step. Here, we provide a detailed experimental protocol and four vectors, each encoding a different dominant selectable marker cassette, that enable YRBC of constructs to be used in the wheat pathogen Z. tritici.

AB The lack of techniques for rapid assembly of gene deletion vectors, paucity of selectable marker genes available for genetic manipulation and low frequency of homologous recombination are major constraints in construction of gene deletion mutants in Zymoseptoria tritici. To address these issues, we have constructed ternary vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of Z. tritici, which enable the single step assembly of multiple fragments via yeast recombinational cloning. The sulfonylurea resistance gene, which is a mutated allele of the Magnaporthe oryzae ILV2 gene, was established as a new dominant selectable marker for Z. tritici. To increase the frequency of homologous recombination, we have constructed 1 tritici strains deficient in the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA double stranded break repair by inactivating the KU70 and KU80 genes. Targeted gene deletion frequency increased to more than 85% in both Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains, compared to <= 10% seen in the wild type parental strain IPO323. The in vitro growth and in planta pathogenicity of the Z tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains were comparable to strain IPO323. Together these molecular tools add significantly to the platform available for genomic analysis through targeted gene deletion or promoter replacements and will facilitate large-scale functional characterization projects in Z. tritici.

AB Understanding the cellular organization and biology of fungal pathogens requires accurate methods for genomic integration of mutant alleles or fluorescent fusion-protein constructs. In zymoseptoria tritici, this can be achieved by integrating of plasmid DNA randomly into the genome of this wheat pathogen. However, untargeted ectopic integration carries the risk of unwanted side effects, such as altered gene expression, due to targeting regulatory elements, or gene disruption following integration into protein-coding regions of the genome. Here, we establish the succinate dehydrogenase (sdi1) locus as a single "soft-landing" site for targeted ectopic integration of genetic constructs by using a carboxin-resistant sdi1(R) allele, carrying the point-mutation H267L. We use various green and red fluorescent fusion constructs and show that 97% of all transformants integrate correctly into the sdi1 locus as single copies. We also demonstrate that such integration does not affect the pathogenicity of Z. tritici, and thus the sdi1 locus is a useful tool for virulence analysis in genetically modified Z. tritici strains. Furthermore, we have developed a vector which facilitates yeast recombination cloning and thus allows assembly of multiple overlapping DNA fragments in a single cloning step for high throughput vector and strain generation.

AB Gene overexpression is a widely used functional genomics approach in fungal biology. However, to date it has not been established in Zymoseptoria tritici which is an important pathogen of wheat (Triticum species). Here we report a suite of Gateway (R) recombination compatible ternary expression vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of Z. tritici. The suite of 32 vectors is based on a combination of four resistance markers for positive selection against glufosinate ammonium, geneticin, hygromycin and sulfonylurea; three constitutive Z. tritici promoters (pZtATUB, pZtGAPDH and pZtTEF) and a nitrogen responsive promoter (pZtNIA1) for controlled expression of the open reading frames. Half of the vectors facilitate expression of proteins tagged with C-terminal EGFP. All 32 vectors allow high frequency targeting of the overexpression cassette into the Ku70 locus and complement the Ku70 gene when transformed into a Z. tritici ku70 null strain, thus circumventing additional phenotypes that can arise from random integration. This suite of ternary expression vectors will be a useful tool for functional analysis through gene overexpression in Z tritici. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Genetic manipulation of fungi requires quick, low-cost, efficient, high-throughput and molecular tools. In this paper, we report 22 entry constructs as new molecular tools based on the Gateway technology facilitating rapid construction of binary vectors that can be used for functional analysis of genes in fungi. The entry vectors for single, double or triple gene-deletion mutants were developed using hygromycin, geneticin and nourseothricin resistance genes as selection markers. Furthermore, entry vectors containing green fluorescent (GFP) or red fluorescent (RFP) in combination with hygromycin, geneticin or nourseothricin selection markers were generated. The latter vectors provide the possibility of gene deletion and simultaneous labelling of the fungal transformants with GFP or RFP reporter genes. The applicability of a number of entry vectors was validated in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important fungal wheat pathogen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The wheat line 'Chapio' is resistant to leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticinia, and was derived from a breeding programme that focuses on multigenic resistance to provide durability. This line was crossed with the susceptible 'Avocet' to develop an F6 recombinant inbred line population. The population was phenotyped for leaf rust severity in two environments each in Mexico and China. There were significant differences in the loci providing resistance between the two intercontinental regions. The Lr34 locus had large effects in both Mexico and China, highlighting its importance in providing a basis for broad-spectrum resistance. The Lr46 locus on chromosome 1BL and a 3D locus had effects in Mexico but not in China. Presence of Sr2 was determined by the phenotypic marker of pseudo-black chaff and was mapped to chromosome 3BS. This region was associated with a QTL that had strong effects in China but no significant effect in Mexico, as did a locus on chromosome 4B. Seedling tests on the parents indicated that the 3B locus was not the complimentary gene Lr27, but the 4B locus was in the same position as Lr31 (or Lr12). Further investigations showed that these loci worked independently and additively in adult plants. Chapio was bred for quantitative, non-race-specific resistance under strong phenotypic selection for leaf rust in Mexico. It is interesting that different QTLs contribute to this resistance in another country, and these results suggest that environmental effects, as well as race specificity, can play a role in expression of resistance.

AB Multiple structural aberrations produced by chromosome breakage and reunion not only provide new germplasm for enriching genetic diversity but are also helpful for physical mapping of alien chromosomes introgressed into wheat. In this study, mass structural aberrations of rye chromosome 2R were induced by means of spontaneous breakage and reunion, gametocidal chromosome action and irradiation. A total of 88 chromosome 2R aberrations were identified in 65 plants. From the self-pollinated progenies of plants carrying these aberrations, 19 stable lines with different segments of chromosome 2R which included seven whole arm, six small segmental and three large segmental translocations, one deletion and two ditelosomic additions, were subsequently identified and characterized using cytogenetic and molecular markers. Based on these lines, 88 markers specific for chromosome 2R were physically mapped to 13 different blocks of 2R with three in arm 2RS and 10 in arm 2RL. The powdery mildew resistance gene PmJZHM2RL was located to a region corresponding to the block 2RL-7. A total of eighteen 2R-specific EST markers were located in the same block where ten were derived from genes that were up-regulated during powdery mildew infection. Potential use of these stable aberrations and the colinearity of chromosome 2R with corresponding chromosomes in the other model monocot species were discussed.

AB While modern agriculture relies on genetic homogeneity, diversifying practices associated with seed exchange and seed recycling may allow crops to adapt to their environment. This socio-genetic model is an original experimental evolution design referred to as on-farm dynamic management of crop diversity. Investigating such model can help in understanding how evolutionary mechanisms shape crop diversity submitted to diverse agro-environments. We studied a French farmer-led initiative where a mixture of four wheat landraces called Melange de Touselles' (MDT) was created and circulated within a farmers' network. The 15 sampled MDT subpopulations were simultaneously submitted to diverse environments (e.g. altitude, rainfall) and diverse farmers' practices (e.g. field size, sowing and harvesting date). Twenty-one space-time samples of 80 individuals each were genotyped using 17 microsatellite markers and characterized for their heading date in a common-garden' experiment. Gene polymorphism was studied using four markers located in earliness genes. An original network-based approach was developed to depict the particular and complex genetic structure of the landraces composing the mixture. Rapid differentiation among populations within the mixture was detected, larger at the phenotypic and gene levels than at the neutral genetic level, indicating potential divergent selection. We identified two interacting selection processes: variation in the mixture component frequencies, and evolution of within-variety diversity, that shaped the standing variability available within the mixture. These results confirmed that diversifying practices and environments maintain genetic diversity and allow for crop evolution in the context of global change. Including concrete measurements of farmers' practices is critical to disentangle crop evolution processes.

AB Prairie cordgrass has recently gained attention as an important biotic component of stressed ecosystems. This polyploid species is distributed broadly across the U.S. More cytogenetic data are needed to investigate how increased ploidy levels influence chromosome changes and gene expression in order to understand the formation of stable cytotypes. Silver staining is the cytogenetic method commonly used to study the number and distribution of active nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) on chromosomes at metaphase, and the number and size of nucleoli in nuclei at interphase. Intensity and distribution patterns of silver stained NORs (AgNORs) reveal differential ribosomal gene expressions in plants and animals. The purpose of this study is to estimate the number of AgNORs, their locations, and their activities in metaphase chromosomes and to determine heteromorphic variation in size and number of nucleoli within interphase nuclei for tetra-, hexa-, and octoploid prairie cordgrass populations. Increases in mean numbers of AgNORs in each metaphase and interphase cell were observed as ploidy level increases. Although distribution patterns of silver stained NORs at metaphase cells of tetra- and octoploids reflect changes in ploidy, the neo-hexaploids did not follow the pattern, indicating that active NORs were not stable in early generation of formation of neo-hexaploidy. Collectively, these results suggest that distribution patterns of silver stained NORs in metaphase and number of silver stained nucleoli in interphase cells can be used as markers to detecting chromosome variations within and among ploidy levels and to determine when ploidy levels stabilize in prairie cordgrass.

AB Plant growth-promoting bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are present in the rhizosphere and as endophytes of many crops. In this research we studied 40 Azospirillum strains isolated from different plants and geographic regions. They were first characterized by 16S rDNA restriction analysis, and their phylogenetic position was established by sequencing the genes 16S rDNA, ipdC, hisC1, and hisC2. The latter three genes are involved in the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) biosynthesis pathway of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Furthermore, the suitability of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer sequence (IGS) for the differentiation of closely related Azospirillum taxa and development of PCR protocols allows for specific detection of strains. The IGS-RFLP analysis enabled intraspecies differentiation, particularly of Azospirillum brasilense and Azospirillum lipoferum strains. Results demonstrated that the ipdC, hisC1, and hisC2 genes are highly conserved in all the assessed A. brasilense isolates, suggesting that these genes can be used as an alternative phylogenetic marker. In addition, IAA production determined by HPLC ranged from 0.17 to 98.2 mu g mg(-1) protein. Southern hybridization with the A. brasilense ipdC gene probe did not show, a hybridization signal with A. lipoferum, Azospirillum amazonense, Azospirillum halopreferans and Azospirillum irakense genomic DNA. This suggests that these species produce IAA by other pathways. Because IAA is mainly synthesized via the IPyA pathway in A. brasilense strains, a species that is used worldwide in agriculture, the identification of ipdC, hisC1, and hisC2 genes by PCR may be suitable for selecting exploitable strains.

AB Wheat continues to be one of the most cultivated cereals in the world, and also in Romania. Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina reduces the wheat yield and grains quality worldwide. In the context of climate change, leaf rust has become a more important problem for both wheat growers and breeders in our country. Use of genetic resources, carrying rust resistance genes, play an important role in breeding programs leading to resistant varieties, which can have positive impact on environment and economy. Therefore, the identification of resistance genes in modern wheat cultivars and breeding lines, and then selection of the best resistance genes combination(s) are the first steps for a successful breeding program. At present, one of the best known and studied adult plant leaf rust resistance gene is Lr34 that contributes significantly to durable leaf rust resistance. The functional markers that enable early detection of this gene are a major advantage in the wheat breeding.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the slow rusting resistance gene Lr34 in Romanian wheat germplasm, using cssfr4 and cssfr5 molecular markers. Screening of 47 winter bread wheat cultivars and 47 breeding lines with these markers showed the presence of the Lr34 resistant haplotype in 62% (homozygous genotypes) of the total genotypes. A high frequency (79%) of Lr34 resistance allele was found among 47 breeding lines, suggesting that maintenance of a high frequency of this allele represents a real advantage for the development of adult plant resistance in Romanian breeding programs.

AB Two lines, L-19-613 and L-19-626, were produced from the common wheat cultivar Longmai 19 (L-19) by six consecutive backcrosses using biochemical marker-assisted selection. L-19 (Glu-D1a, Glu-A3c/Gli-A1?; Gli-A1? is a gene coding for unnamed gliadin) and L-19-613 (Glu-D1d, Glu-A3c/Gli-A1?) formed a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for HMW-GS, while L-19-613 and L-19-626 (Glu-D1d, Glu-A3e/Gli-A1m) constituted another set of NILs for the LMW-GS/gliadins. The three L-19 NILs were grown in the wheat breeding nursery in 2007 and 2008. The field experiments were designed using the three-column contrast arrangement method with four replicates. The three lines were ranked as follows for measurements of gluten strength, which was determined by the gluten index, Zeleny sedimentation, the stability and breakdown time of the farinogram, the maximum resistance and area of the extensogram, and the P andWvalues of the alveogram: L-19-613 > L-19-626 > L-19. The parameters listed above were significantly different between lines at the 0.05 or 0.01 level. The Glu-D1 and Glu-A3/Gli-A1 loci had additive effects on the gluten index, Zeleny sedimentation, stability, breakdown time, maximum resistance, area, P andWvalues. Although genetic variation at the Glu-A3/Gli-A1 locus had a great influence on wheat quality, the genetic difference between Glu-D1d and Glu-D1a at the Glu-D1 locus was much larger than that of Glu-A3c/Gli-A1? and Glu-A3e/Gli-A1m at the Glu-A3/Gli-A1 locus. Glu-D1d had negative effects on the extensibility and the L value compared with Glu-D1a. In contrast, Glu-A3c/ Gli-A1? had a positive effect on these traits compared with Glu-A3e/Gli-A1m.

AB The main motive of the present work was to detect and confirm the presence of the 1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation in elite Hellenic bread wheat germplasm. For this, a molecular method was employed and seven Hellenic bread wheat cultivars (Acheloos, Acheron, Chios, Elisavet, Myconos, Orpheus, and Vergina) were studied. A rye population originated from Florina, and cultivar Kavkaz/Cgn, one of the donors of the 1BL.1RS translocation to bread wheat, were used as positive checks. The polymerase chain reaction was applied and two promoters for bread wheat gene alleles located on short arm of chromosome 1B (GLU-B3, GLI-B3) and one promoter for a rye gene (SEC I) located on short arm of chromosome 1R, were involved. It was demonstrated that cultivars Acheron, Elisavet and Orpheus do carry the 1BL.1RS translocation, whereas the rest of the varieties studied, they do not it. It was concluded that cultivars Acheron, Elisavet and Orpheus that carry the translocation, could be crossed to other elite genotypes lucking the translocation and produce new varieties possessing the advantages of the 1BL.1RS translocation. A special attention should be given to cultivar Acheron since this cultivar, despite the presence of the translocation carries favourable alleles in other gene loci affecting positively the quality of the produced bread.

AB Plant height and spikelet density are important agronomic traits related to plant architecture and grain yield in wheat. The development of wheat mutants not only provided new genetic resources for wheat improvement, but also facilitated our understanding of the regulation of these traits at the molecular level. Here, we report the identification of a dwarf mutant with a compact spike. NAUH164, produced from ethyl methyl sulfonate treatment of wheat variety Sumai 3, has reduced plant height and shortened spike length. Microscopic observations showed that the mutant has an atypical vascular bundle arrangement and overall smaller cell volumes. Sensitivity of seedlings to exogenous gibberellin was not changed, and plant height was not restored to the level of the wildtype. Dwarfness and compact spike were controlled by a single dominant gene that was designated Rht23, which was mapped 4.7 cM distal to SSR marker Gdm63 and 11.1 cM proximal to Barc110 on chromosome 5DL. Comparative sequence analysis of the co-linear regions in common wheat and Aegilops taushii indicated that Rht23 occurs in a physical interval of 8.5 Mb.

AB Barley powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei is a most devastating disease in Western Australia and elsewhere. The disease has a negative impact on grain yield and quality and, thus, affects its marketability. The detection of pathogen variability has further impacted sustainable barley production. Various isolates have been reported to have broken down the resistance genes present in the upcoming barley cultivars. Because of this there is an increasing importance to identify novel resistances to powdery mildew with its effectiveness across barley growing regions of Australia. A set of 12 lines out of 101, which have originated from Australia, Czech Republic, South America, Sweden, South Africa and CIMMYT/ICARDA, was studied for growth stage responses in which 11 lines were identified to have adult plant resistance (seedling susceptibility). This set was evaluated over 2 years and across five different environments in Western Australia and Tasmania. Majority of the lines are effective across different environments and warrants its characterisation. The set holds a great promise and can broad narrow genetic base of current barley cultivars. This is a first report of identification of adult plant resistance for powdery mildew in barley lines from Australia.

AB The RWA, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), is a devastating insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) in the United States and in many parts of the world. The use of D. noxia-resistant cultivars is an economically useful approach for protecting cereals from this aphid. However, there are few genes conferring resistance to the most predominant US biotype (Biotype RWA2). Wheat line CI2401, originating from Tajikistan, has been identified to be resistant to RWA2. An F-2-derived F-3 (F-2:3) segregating population developed from a cross between CI2401 and Glupro (a high quality susceptible wheat cultivar) was used to genetically map the resistance in CI2401. Seedlings from F-2 individuals and F-3 families were infested with RWA2 aphids. Seedling reactions were scored as resistant or susceptible based on the degrees of leaf rolling and chlorosis. The observed segregation ratios in the F-2 and F-3 generations indicate the presence of a major dominant gene controlling resistance to RWA2. The gene, named Dn2401, was genetically mapped to the short arm of chromosome 7D. Xbarc214 mapped 1.1 cM and Xgwm473 mapped 1.8 cM distal and proximal, respectively, to the gene. Association studies using more than 12,000 SNPs and SilicoDArTs confirmed the presence of a major signal associated with resistance on chromosome 7DS. In addition, a minor signal was detected in chromosome 1D. The markers developed in this study will be useful for marker-assisted-breeding for resistance to RWA2.

AB This manuscript describes the transfer and molecular cytogenetic characterization of a novel source of Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.
   Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telomorph = Gibberella zeae (Schwein. Fr.) Petch] is an important disease of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) worldwide. Wheat has limited resistance to FHB controlled by many loci and new sources of resistance are urgently needed. The perennial grass Elymus tsukushiensis thrives in the warm and humid regions of China and Japan and is immune to FHB. Here, we report the transfer and mapping of a major gene Fhb6 from E. tsukushiensis to wheat. Fhb6 was mapped to the subterminal region in the short arm of chromosome 1E(ts)#1S of E. tsukushiensis. Chromosome engineering was used to replace corresponding homoeologous region of chromosome 1AS of wheat with the Fhb6 associated chromatin derived from 1E(ts)#1S of E. tsukushiensis. Fhb6 appears to be new locus for wheat as previous studies have not detected any FHB resistance QTL in this chromosome region. Plant progenies homozygous for Fhb6 had a disease severity rating of 7 % compared to 35 % for the null progenies. Fhb6 has been tagged with molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding and pyramiding of resistance loci for effective control of FHB.

AB Potential novel and known QTL for race-specific all-stage and adult plant resistance to stripe rust were identified by genome-wide association mapping in the US PNW winter wheat accessions.
   Stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis F. sp. tritici; also known as yellow rust) is a globally devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and a major threat to wheat production in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW), therefore both adult plant and all-stage resistance have been introduced into the winter wheat breeding programs in the PNW. The goal of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and molecular markers for these resistances through genome-wide association (GWAS) mapping in winter wheat accessions adapted to the PNW. Stripe rust response for adult plants was evaluated in naturally occurring epidemics in a total of nine environments in Washington State, USA. Seedling response was evaluated with three races under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse. The panel was genotyped with the 9K Illumina Wheat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and additional markers linked to previously reported genes and QTL for stripe rust resistance. The population was grouped into three sub-populations. Markers linked to Yr17 and previously reported QTL for stripe rust resistance were identified on chromosomes 1B, 2A, and 2B. Potentially novel QTL associated with race-specific seedling response were identified on chromosomes 1B and 1D. Potentially novel QTL associated with adult plant response were located on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3B, 4A, and 4B. Stripe rust was reduced when multiple alleles for resistance were present. The resistant allele frequencies were different among sub-populations in the panel. This information provides breeders with germplasm and closely linked markers for stripe rust resistance to facilitate the transfer of multiple loci for durable stripe rust resistance into wheat breeding lines and cultivars.

AB The identification of genetic markers linked to genes of agronomic importance is a major aim of crop research and breeding programmes. Here, we identify markers for Yr15, a major disease resistance gene for wheat yellow rust, using a segregating F-2 population. After phenotyping, we implemented RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of bulked pools to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with Yr15. Over 27000 genes with SNPs were identified between the parents, and then classified based on the results from the sequenced bulks. We calculated the bulk frequency ratio (BFR) of SNPs between resistant and susceptible bulks, selecting those showing sixfold enrichment/depletion in the corresponding bulks (BFR>6). Using additional filtering criteria, we reduced the number of genes with a putative SNP to 175. The 35 SNPs with the highest BFR values were converted into genome-specific KASP assays using an automated bioinformatics pipeline (PolyMarker) which circumvents the limitations associated with the polyploid wheat genome. Twenty-eight assays were polymorphic of which 22 (63%) mapped in the same linkage group as Yr15. Using these markers, we mapped Yr15 to a 0.77-cM interval. The three most closely linked SNPs were tested across varieties and breeding lines representing UK elite germplasm. Two flanking markers were diagnostic in over 99% of lines tested, thus providing a reliable haplotype for marker-assisted selection in these breeding programmes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be applied in polyploid F-2 populations to generate high-resolution genetic maps across target intervals.

AB Wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng substitution line 16-6, which possessed superior numbers of florets and kernels per spike, was developed from a cross between common wheat cv. 7182 and P. huashanica via embryo culture. This line was characterized based on cytological, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), simple sequence repeat (SSR), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), expressed sequence tag-sequence-tagged site (EST-STS), and morphological analyses. Line 16-6 contained 21 bivalents during meiosis, while GISH studies detected an alien chromosome pair substitution. Sixteen microsatellite markers for chromosome arms 2DS and 2DL of hexaploid wheat and FISH using the probe pAs1 indicated that chromosome 2D was missing. P. huashanica 2Ns(2D) chromosome introgression was confirmed using 780 EST-STS multiple-loci markers that covered all seven homoeologous groups and 14 EST-STS markers associated with homoeologous group 2 of wheat. After inoculation using mixed races of stripe rust (CYR31, CYR32, and SY11-14) in the adult stages, line 16-6 exhibited resistance, which was derived from the donor species. Compared with the control, the spike length, number of spikelets per spike, and kernel number per spike were significantly higher.

AB Genetic transformation using foreign genes and the subsequent development of transgenic plants has been employed to develop enhanced elite germplasm. Although some skepticism exits regarding pollen tube-mediated gene transfer (PTT), reports demonstrating improved transformation efficiency with PTT systems are increasing and encouraging and the adoption of increasingly refined pollen-mediated methodologies may lead to species-dependent improvements in breeding. Here, we highlight PTT technology as an alternative to genetic transformation.

AB Background: Premature leaf senescence induced by external stress conditions, e.g. drought stress, is a main factor for yield losses in barley. Research in drought stress tolerance has become more important as due to climate change the number of drought periods will increase and tolerance to drought stress has become a goal of high interest in barley breeding. Therefore, the aim is to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in drought stress induced leaf senescence and drought stress tolerance in early developmental stages of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by applying genome wide association studies (GWAS) on a set of 156 winter barley genotypes.
   Results: After a four weeks stress period (BBCH 33) leaf colour as an indicator of leaf senescence, electron transport rate at photosystem II, content of free proline, content of soluble sugars, osmolality and the aboveground biomass indicative for drought stress response were determined in the control and stress variant in greenhouse pot experiments. Significant phenotypic variation was observed for all traits analysed. Heritabilities ranged between 0.27 for osmolality and 0.61 for leaf colour in stress treatment and significant effects of genotype, treatment and genotype x treatment were estimated for most traits analysed. Based on these phenotypic data and 3,212 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP) with a minor allele frequency >5 % derived from the Illumina 9 k iSelect SNP Chip, 181 QTL were detected for all traits analysed. Major QTLs for drought stress and leaf senescence were located on chromosome 5H and 2H. BlastX search for associated marker sequences revealed that respective SNPs are in some cases located in proteins related to drought stress or leaf senescence, e.g. nucleotide pyrophosphatase (AVP1) or serine/threonin protein kinase (SAPK9).
   Conclusions: GWAS resulted in the identification of many QTLs involved in drought stress and leaf senescence of which two major QTLs for drought stress and leaf senescence were located on chromosome 5H and 2H. Results may be the basis to incorporate breeding for tolerance to drought stress or leaf senescence in barley breeding via marker based selection procedures.

AB Background: Majority of the Asian people depend on rice for nutritional energy. Rice cultivation and yield are severely affected by soil salinity stress worldwide. Marker assisted breeding is a rapid and efficient way to develop improved variety for salinity stress tolerance. Genomic microsatellite markers are an elite group of markers, but there is possible uncertainty of linkage with the important genes. In contrast, there are better possibilities of linkage detection with important genes if SSRs are developed from candidate genes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such report on SSR markers development from candidate gene sequences in rice. So the present study was aimed to identify and analyse SSRs from salt responsive candidate genes of rice.
   Results: In the present study, based on the comprehensive literature survey, we selected 220 different salt responsive genes of rice. Out of them, 106 genes were found to contain 180 microsatellite loci with, tri-nucleotide motifs (56%) being most abundant, followed by di-(41%) and tetra nucleotide (2.8%) motifs. Maximum loci were found in the coding sequences (37.2%), followed by in 5' UTR (26%), intron (21.6%) and 3'UTR (15%). For validation, 19 primer sets were evaluated to detect polymorphism in diversity analysis among the two panels consisting of 17 salt tolerant and 17 susceptible rice genotypes. Except one, all primer sets exhibited polymorphic nature with an average of 21.8 alleles/ primer and with a mean PIC value of 0.28. Calculated genetic similarity among genotypes was ranged from 19%-89%. The generated dendrogram showed 3 clusters of which one contained entire 17 susceptible genotypes and another two clusters contained all tolerant genotypes.
   Conclusion: The present study represents the potential of salt responsive candidate gene based SSR (cgSSR) markers to be utilized as novel and remarkable candidate for diversity analysis among rice genotypes differing in salinity response.

AB Background: The number and complexity of repetitive elements varies between species, being in general most represented in those with larger genomes. Combining the flow-sorted chromosome arms approach to genome analysis with second generation DNA sequencing technologies provides a unique opportunity to study the repetitive portion of each chromosome, enabling comparisons among them. Additionally, different sequencing approaches may produce different depth of insight to repeatome content and structure. In this work we analyze and characterize the repetitive sequences of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring homeologous group 4 chromosome arms, obtained through Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing technologies, hereinafter marked by subscripts 454 and I, respectively. Repetitive sequences were identified with the RepeatMasker software using the interspersed repeat database mips-REdat_v9.0p. The input sequences consisted of our 4DS(454) and 4DL(454) scaffolds and 4AS(I), 4AL(I), 4BS(I), 4BL(I), 4DS(I) and 4DL(I) contigs, downloaded from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC).
   Results: Repetitive sequences content varied from 55% to 63% for all chromosome arm assemblies except for 4DLI, in which the repeat content was 38%. Transposable elements, small RNA, satellites, simple repeats and low complexity sequences were analyzed. SSR frequency was found one per 24 to 27 kb for all chromosome assemblies except 4DL(I), where it was three times higher. Dinucleotides and trinucleotides were the most abundant SSR repeat units. (GA)n/(TC)n was the most abundant SSR except for 4DLI where the most frequently identified SSR was (CCG/CGG)(n). Retrotransposons followed by DNA transposons were the most highly represented sequence repeats, mainly composed of CACTA/En-Spm and Gypsy superfamilies, respectively. This whole chromosome sequence analysis allowed identification of three new LTR retrotransposon families belonging to the Copia superfamily, one belonging to the Gypsy superfamily and two TRIM retrotransposon families. Their physical distribution in wheat genome was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and one of them, the Carmen retrotransposon, was found specific for centromeric regions of all wheat chromosomes.
   Conclusion: The presented work is the first deep report of wheat repetitive sequences analyzed at the chromosome arm level, revealing the first insight into the repeatome of T. aestivum chromosomes of homeologous group 4.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by the biotrophic parasitic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a prevalent disease in many wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-producing regions throughout the world. To reduce yield losses and avoid environmental pollution caused by fungicide application, growing resistant cultivars is the preferred means for managing wheat powdery mildew. 'Zhongmai 155', a commercial winter wheat cultivar released in 2012, was resistant to 92 of the 115 Bgt isolates originating from northern China. Using segregating F-2 and F-2:3 populations derived from Zhongmai 155 x 'Han 4564' cross, genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant resistance gene, tentatively designated PmZ155, was responsible for the resistance of Zhongmai 155 to the Bgt isolate E09. The gene was subsequently localized on chromosome 5DS on the basis of the results of molecular marker analysis. The flanking markers SCAR203 and Xcfd8 are linked to gene PmZ155 at genetic distances of 0.3 and 4.9 cM, respectively, and were physically mapped to the deletion bin 5DS-1-0-0.63; therefore, PmZ155 is located in this region of chromosome 5DS and shares the same molecular markers as Pm2. However, Zhongmai 155 differed from Ulka/8*Cc (CI 14118), which carries gene Pm2 on chromosome 5DS, in its reactions to 26 of 111 commonly tested isolates, of which 18 isolates were avirulent on Zhongmai 155 but virulent on Ulka/8*Cc, while 8 isolates were virulent on Zhongmai 155 but avirulent on Ulka/8* Cc. Zhongmai 155 also differed from 'Tabasco' (carrying Pm48 on chromosome 5DS) in its reaction to 14 of 62 isolates. On the basis of its chromosome position, close linkage to the molecular markers Xcfd8 and SCAR203, but different responses to an array of Bgt isolates, it appears that PmZ155 is most likely an allele of locus Pm2.

AB Rapid advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing have enabled the generation of new technology and resources for cryptococcal research. RNAi-mediated specific gene knock down has become routine and more efficient by utilizing modified shRNA plasmids and convergent promoter RNAi constructs. This system was recently applied in a high-throughput screen to identify genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Gene deletion efficiencies have also been improved by increasing rates of homologous recombination through a number of approaches, including a combination of double-joint PCR with split-marker transformation, the use of dominant selectable markers and the introduction of Cre-Loxp systems into Cryptococcus. Moreover, visualization of cryptococcal proteins has become more facile using fusions with codon-optimized fluorescent tags, such as green or red fluorescent proteins or, mCherry. Using recent genome-wide analytical tools, new transcriptional factors and regulatory proteins have been identified in novel virulence-related signaling pathways by employing microarray analysis, RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis.

AB Introgressive hybridization of common wheat has been and remains an efficient way for enriching its gene pool with resistance genes against environmental stress factors. In this aspect, T genome of the diploid species Amblyopyrum muticum (Boiss.) Eig. is believed to be prospective. The genome substitution amphidiploid Aurotica (AABBTT) with the A and B subgenomes from the common wheat cultivar Aurora and with the T subgenome from the indicated species is characterized by a high level of winter resistance. This trait is associated in wheat with the chromosomes of the fifth homoeologous group. Using a comparative microsatellite analysis of Aurora and Aurotica DNAs, we identified nine SSR loci specific for the wheat D genome, whose primers produced different amplicons from Aurotica DNA. The latter were used in screening F-5 plants (Aurora x Aurotica) for the search of the specimens that carried the 5T chromosome or its fragments in their genomes. Among 234 plants, we detected 24 plants with disomic 5D/5T substitutions, which were the progeny of five F-4 plants grown from two F-2 plants. A significant number of plants contained the recombinant 5D/5T chromosome. The recombination event could occur in any generation starting with F-2.

AB It is important to detect wheat broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes in commercial cultivars with superior agronomic performance. YingBo 700, a Chinese commercial cultivar registered and released in 2012, showed a broad spectrum of resistance to 48 of 49 tested Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) isolates from different regions of China. Genetic analysis of F-2 populations from the crosses YingBo 700 x Mingxian 169 and YingBo 700 x Shimai 15 and F-2:3 lines from YingBo 700 x Mingxian 169 demonstrated that the resistance was controlled by a single dominant resistance gene, which was temporarily designated PmYB. Using molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis of the F-2:3 lines from YingBo 700 x Mingxian 169, PmYB was mapped to the multi-allelic Pm2 region of chromosome arm 5DS co-segregated with the sequence- characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker SCAR112 and flanked by the simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker Cfd81 and SCAR marker SCAR203 with genetic distance of 0.9 and 1.9 cM, respectively. YingBo 700 showed a unique response pattern to different Bgt isolates compared with the lines with documented Pm2a, Pm2b, Pm48, PmLX66, PmW14, PmZ155 and PmX3986-2 on chromosome arm 5DS. Therefore, PmYB appears to be a novel allele in this multi-allelic region. In order to validate applicability of the closely linked markers for marker-assisted selection, the closely linked markers Cfd81, SCAR112, SCAR203 and Mag6176 were evaluated for applicability in diagnosing the resistance gene in 62 cultivars from different regions of China. The results will contribute to rapidly transfer of PmYB into more cultivars.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint on crop production in acid soils around the world. Hexaploid oat (Avena sativa L.) possesses significant Al tolerance making it a good candidate for production in these environments. Genetic improvement for Al tolerance in oat has traditionally been achieved through conventional plant breeding and could be enhanced by marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to develop a chromosome-anchored genetic map for an oat recombinant inbred population and to identify SNP markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting root growth response to Al. Three QTL on chromosomes 7C-17A, 13A, and 19A conferring Al tolerance were identified using primary root regrowth of recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between UFRGS 17 (Al tolerant) and UFRGS 930598-6 (Al sensitive). Localization of each QTL onto the sequenced rice genome revealed the genetic region on chromosome 13A might be associated with a putative malate transporter locus (LOC_Os06g15779). Studies of root apex tissue indicated that exudation of malate was increased in the Al-tolerant parent UFRGS17 and not in the sensitive parent. Based on these data, the malate transporter might be a candidate gene responsible for one of the Al tolerance QTL identified in this study.

AB Recent advances in molecular genetics techniques have made dense marker maps available, and the prediction of breeding value at the genome level has been employed in genetics research. However, an increasingly large number of markers raise both statistical and computational issues in genomic selection (GS), and many methods have been developed for genomic prediction to address these problems, including ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), genomic best linear unbiased prediction, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC pi, and Bayesian LASSO. In this paper, these methods were compared regarding inference under different conditions, using real data from a wheat data set and simulated scenarios with a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) (20), a moderate number of QTL (60, 180) and an extreme number of QTL (540). This study showed that the genetic architecture of a trait should be fully considered when a GS method is chosen. If a small amount of loci had a large effect on a trait, great differences were found between the predictive ability of various methods and BayesC pi was recommended. Although there was almost no significant difference between the predictive ability of BayesC pi and BayesB, BayesC pi is more feasible than BayesB for real data analysis. If a trait was controlled by a moderate number of genes, the absolute differences between the various methods were small, but BayesA was also found to be the most accurate method. Furthermore, BayesA was widely adaptable and could perform well with different numbers of QTL. If a trait was controlled by an extreme number of minor genes, almost no significant differences were detected between the predictive ability of various methods, but RR-BLUP slightly outperformed the others in both simulated scenarios and real data analysis, thus demonstrating its robustness and indicating that it was quite effective in this case.

AB The relationship between crop height and yield is complex with genes and genetic markers for greater height associated with both increases and decreases in yield. As a result of this the optimum height for maximum potential yield is not well understood and has been estimated at between 70 and 100 cm. This study investigated the effect of plant breeding on the height of UK winter wheat varieties by analysing data on straw shortness scores and absolute height collected from UK national variety testing trials between 1977 and 2013. The analysis showed that varietal introductions between the early 1970s and 1980 shortened plant height by approximately 15 cm (110-95 cm) followed by a gradual reduction to about 88 cm by the 1990s. There was no significant trend in height between 1990 and 2013. It was estimated that the reduction in plant height between 1970 and 2000 would have been sufficient to counteract the increase in lodging risk caused by the increase in yield potential of new varieties over this period of approximately 3 t/ha. It is predicted that the lodging risk of varieties introduced since 2000 are likely to have increased due to further increases in yield potential and the absence of further shortening. Possible reasons why UK plant breeders have not continued to shorten wheat are considered.

AB Diseases caused by Puccinia species can have devastating effects on wheat and other crops, causing severe economic losses by reducing grain yield and quality. Generally, three strategies are used to control leaf and stem rust wheat diseases: (i) incorporating genetic resistance into new cultivars (ii) the use of fungicides (iii) crop management. The first approach is the most environmentally and economically efficient. Combined with traditional selection techniques, marker-assisted selection (MAS) has become a valuable tool in selection of individuals carrying genes that control traits of interest, such as disease resistance. The objective of this study is to postulate leaf and stem rust resistance genes in 50 mostly Croatian wheat cultivars. Most of the cultivars were screened for the first time for rust diseases. The studies detected six leaf rust resistance genes (Lr2a, Lr3, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr17 and Lr26) and four stem leaf resistance genes (Sr8a, Sr31, Sr36 and Sr38). Nine wheat cultivars had one or more unidentified Lr genes that were not included in the set of 24 isolines, and six wheat cultivars had one or more unidentifed Sr genes. Knowledge on the identity of the seedling rust resistance genes in released cultivars and germplasm is essential for the incorporation of effective resistance genes into breeding programs to maintain a diversity of resistance genes in commonly grown cultivars.

AB Water deficit stress (WDS) is a serious constraint to wheat productivity in rain-fed and limited irrigation environments. Identifying genomic regions responsible for grain yield (GY) under WDS will aid in understanding the genetics of drought tolerance (DT) and development of DT cultivars. A population of 206 recombinant inbred lines derived from WL711/C306 was phenotyped for GY and related traits under water deficit and irrigated conditions in seven different environments to identify genomic regions associated with eleven yield related traits. Both the parents contributed positive alleles for the traits studied. A novel genomic region for GY under WDS, qGYWD.3B.1 was detected on chromosome 3BS of wheat. The yield enhancing allele under drought stress at this locus was contributed by DT parent C306. This genomic region explained 18.7 % of phenotypic variation for GY under WDS and co-located with genomic regions for GY components. Another novel, consistent genomic region for GY under WDS, qGYWD.3B.2 explained 19.6 % of phenotypic variation with positive allele coming from drought susceptible parent WL711. A novel genomic region for drought susceptibility index for GY, qDSIGY.4A.1 was consistently detected in six of seven environments explaining 15.6 % of phenotypic variation. Other important genomic regions for GY and biomass under WDS were mapped on chromosomes 7BL and 6AS, respectively. Fine mapping of the major QTLs on chromosome 3BS will enable identification of robust markers and candidate genes for marker-assisted breeding for DT in wheat.

AB This paper shows the results of effective uses of a molecular cytogenetics toolbox and molecular marker to transfer leaf rust resistance genes from Aegilops tauschii x Secale cereale (DDRR, 2n = 4x = 28) amphiploid forms to triticale cv. Bogo (AABBRR, 2n = 6x = 42). The molecular markers of resistance genes and in situ hybridization analysis of mitotic metaphase of root meristems confirmed the stable inheritance of chromosome 3D segments carrying Lr32 from the BC2F2 to the BC2F5 generation of (Ae. tauschii x S. cereale) x triticale hybrids. The chromosome pairing analysis during metaphase I of meiosis of BC2F4 and BC2F5 hybrids showed increasing regular bivalent formation of 3D chromosome pairs and decreasing number of univalents in subsequent generations. The results indicate that using amphiploid forms as a bridge between wild and cultivated forms can be a successful technology to transfer the D-genome chromatin carrying leaf rust resistance genes into triticale.

AB The formation and evolution of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome BBAADD) involves allopolyploidization events at two ploidy levels. Whether the two ploidy levels (tetraploidy and hexaploidy) have impacted the BBAA subgenomes differentially remains largely unknown. We have reported recently that extensive and distinct modifications of transcriptome expression occurred to the BBAA component of common wheat relative to the evolution of gene expression at the tetraploid level in Triticum turgidum. As a step further, here we analyzed the genetic and cytosine DNA methylation differences between an extracted tetraploid wheat (ETW) harboring genome BBAA that is highly similar to the BBAA subgenomes of common wheat, and a set of diverse T. turgidum collections, including both wild and cultivated genotypes. We found that while ETW had no significantly altered karyotype from T. turgidum, it diverged substantially from the later at both the nucleotide sequence level and in DNA methylation based on molecular marker assay of randomly sampled loci across the genome. In particular, ETW is globally less cytosine-methylated than T. turgidum, consistent with earlier observations of a generally higher transcriptome expression level in ETW than in T. turgidum. Together, our results suggest that genome evolution at the allohexaploid level has caused extensive genetic and DNA methylation modifications to the BBAA subgenomes of common wheat, which are distinctive from those accumulated at the tetraploid level in both wild and cultivated T. turgidum genotypes.

AB This study explored the genetic constitutions of several wheat- A. cristatum translocation lines and determined the effects of A. cristatum 6P chromosome segments on fertile tiller number in wheat.
   Progress in wheat breeding is hampered by a relatively narrow range of genetic variation. To overcome this hurdle, wild relatives of common wheat with superior agronomic traits are often used as donors of desirable genes in wheat-breeding programs. One of the successfully utilized wheat wild relatives is Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn (2n = 4x = 28; genomes PPPP). We previously reported that WAT31-13 was a wheat-A. cristatum 5A-6P reciprocal translocation line with higher fertile tiller number and grain number per spike compared to common wheat. However, WAT31-13 was genetically unstable. In this study, we analyzed the 43 genetically stable progenies from WAT31-13 using genomic in situ hybridization, dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular markers. We classified them into three translocation types (TrS, TrL and TrA) and seven subtypes, and also pinpointed the translocation breakpoint. The genotypic data, combined with the phenotypes of each translocation type, enabled us to physically map agronomic traits to specific A. cristatum 6P chromosome arms or segments. Our results indicated that A. cristatum chromosome 6P played an important role in regulating fertile tiller number, and that positive and negative regulators of fertile tiller number existed on the A. cristatum chromosome arm 6PS and 6PL, respectively. By exploring the relationship between fertile tiller number and A. cristatum chromosome segment, this study presented a number of feasible approaches for creation, analysis, and utilization of wheat-alien chromosome translocation lines in genetic improvement of wheat.

AB Plant height variation in European winter wheat cultivars is mainly controlled by the Rht - D1 and Rht - B1 semi-dwarfing genes, but also by other medium- or small-effect QTL and potentially epistatic QTL enabling fine adjustments of plant height.
   Plant height is an important goal in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding as it affects crop performance and thus yield and quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic control of plant height in European winter wheat cultivars. To this end, a panel of 410 winter wheat varieties from across Europe was evaluated for plant height in multi-location field trials and genotyped for the candidate loci Rht-B1, Rht-D1, Rht8, Ppd-B1 copy number variation and Ppd-D1 as well as by a genotyping-by-sequencing approach yielding 23,371 markers with known map position. We found that Rht-D1 and Rht-B1 had the largest effects on plant height in this cultivar collection explaining 40.9 and 15.5 % of the genotypic variance, respectively, while Ppd-D1 and Rht8 accounted for 3.0 and 2.0 % of the variance, respectively. A genome-wide scan for marker-trait associations yielded two additional medium-effect QTL located on chromosomes 6A and 5B explaining 11.0 and 5.7 % of the genotypic variance after the effects of the candidate loci were accounted for. In addition, we identified several small-effect QTL as well as epistatic QTL contributing to the genetic architecture of plant height. Taken together, our results show that the two Rht-1 semi-dwarfing genes are the major sources of variation in European winter wheat cultivars and that other small- or medium-effect QTL and potentially epistatic QTL enable fine adjustments in plant height.

AB Three groups of genes, Vrn, Ppd and Eps, control life-cycle duration in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The duration of a developmental phase between two stages is important for freezing resistance, heading time, anthesis and ripening date as well as yield component generation. The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of Vrn-D1 on wheat development. The vernalization genes Vrn-A1, -B1, -D1, -B3, photoperiod gene Ppd-1 and candidate genes Mot1 and FtsH4 for Eps in 'G883', 'Pumai 9' and their offspring, a group of sister lines (SLs) derived from an advanced generation, were genotyped using specific molecular markers. All detected loci were the same in the SLs and their parents except the Vrn-D1 locus. Three developmental traits, spike differentiation process, heading date and final leaf number on the main stem, were characterized in three sowing date treatments in the field. When temperatures increased, cultivars/lines carrying the dominant Vrn-D1 gene entered each spike differentiation process faster than those with the recessive vrn-D1 in the same sowing date treatment. Lines carrying Vrn-D1 had smaller final leaf number on the main stem than those with vrn-D1, and the heading dates of the former were earlier than those of the latter, especially in the fourth treatment, sown on 23 February 2012. These data suggest that Vrn-D1 confers a spring habit on wheat and the vrn-D1 confers a cold, hardy winter habit. The Vrn-D1 alleles play very important roles in semi-winter and tender spring wheat cultivars, especially in warm weather in Henan, China. Regulating developmental traits by tracing Vrn-D1 and getting an ideal combination of Vrn alleles to accommodate different wheat zones is a key role for future wheat molecular breeding.

AB Background: Barley, globally the fourth most important cereal, provides food and beverages for humans and feed for animal husbandry. Maximizing grain yield under varying climate conditions largely depends on the optimal timing of flowering. Therefore, regulation of flowering time is of extraordinary importance to meet future food and feed demands. We developed the first barley nested association mapping (NAM) population, HEB-25, by crossing 25 wild barleys with one elite barley cultivar, and used it to dissect the genetic architecture of flowering time.
   Results: Upon cultivation of 1,420 lines in multi-field trials and applying a genome-wide association study, eight major quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified as main determinants to control flowering time in barley. These QTL accounted for 64% of the cross-validated proportion of explained genotypic variance (p(G)). The strongest single QTL effect corresponded to the known photoperiod response gene Ppd-H1. After sequencing the causative part of Ppd-H1, we differentiated twelve haplotypes in HEB-25, whereof the strongest exotic haplotype accelerated flowering time by 11 days compared to the elite barley haplotype. Applying a whole genome prediction model including main effects and epistatic interactions allowed predicting flowering time with an unmatched accuracy of 77% of cross-validated pG.
   Conclusions: The elaborated causal models represent a fundamental step to explain flowering time in barley. In addition, our study confirms that the exotic biodiversity present in HEB-25 is a valuable toolbox to dissect the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits and to replenish the elite barley breeding pool with favorable, trait-improving exotic alleles.

AB Background: Physical maps created from large insert DNA libraries, typically cloned in BAC vector, are valuable resources for map-based cloning and de novo genome sequencing. The maps are most useful if contigs of overlapping DNA clones are anchored to chromosome(s), and ordered along them using molecular markers. Here we present a novel approach for anchoring physical maps, based on sequencing three-dimensional pools of BAC clones from minimum tilling path.
   Results: We used physical map of wheat chromosome arm 3DS to validate the method with two different DNA sequence datasets. The first comprised 567 genes ordered along the chromosome arm based on syntenic relationship of wheat with the sequenced genomes of Brachypodium, rice and sorghum. The second dataset consisted of 7,136 SNP-containing sequences, which were mapped genetically in Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the wheat D genome. Mapping of sequence reads from individual BAC pools to the first and the second datasets enabled unambiguous anchoring 447 and 311 3DS-specific sequences, respectively, or 758 in total.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate the utility of the novel approach for BAC contig anchoring based on mass parallel sequencing of three-dimensional pools prepared from minimum tilling path of physical map. The existing genetic markers as well as any other DNA sequence could be mapped to BAC clones in a single in silico experiment. The approach reduces significantly the cost and time needed for anchoring and is applicable to any genomic project involving the construction of anchored physical map.

AB Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is an important cereal of traditional farming systems that has the natural ability to withstand various abiotic stresses. The present study aims at the identification and validation of major differentially expressed genes in response to drought stress in P. glaucum by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) analysis. Twenty-two days old seedlings of P. glaucum cultivar PPMI741 were subjected to drought stress by treatment of 30 % Polyethylene glycol for different time periods 30 min (T1), 2 h (T2), 4 h (T3), 8 h (T4), 16 h (T5), 24 h (T6) and 48 h (T7) respectively, monitored by examining the RWC of seedlings. Total RNA was isolated to construct drought responsive subtractive cDNA library through SSH, sequenced to identify the differentially expressed genes in response to drought stress and validated by qRT-PCR. 745 ESTs were assembled into a collection of 299 unigenes having 52 contigs and 247 singletons. All 745 ESTs were submitted to ENA-EMBL databases (Accession no. HG516611-HG517355). After analysis, 10 differentially expressed genes were validated namely Abscisic stress ripening protein, Ascorbate peroxidase, Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, Putative beta-1, 3-glucanase, Glyoxalase, Rab7, Aspartic proteinase Oryzasin, DnaJ-like protein and Calmodulin-like protein by qRT-PCR. The identified ESTs reveal a major portion of the stress responsive transcriptome that may prove to be a vent to unravel molecular basis underlying tolerance of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) to drought stress.

TI Yr60, a Gene Conferring Moderate Resistance to Stripe Rust in Wheat
SO PLANT DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION; LEAF; QTLS
AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici W., is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. A new stripe rust resistance gene with moderate seedling and adult plant resistance was mapped using an F-5 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from the cross of the resistant parent 'Almop' with the susceptible parent 'Avocet'. The parents and RILs were phenotyped for seedling stripe rust response variation in a greenhouse and in field trials at Toluca, Mexico for 2 years. Almop showed moderate levels of resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages compared with the highly susceptible response of Avocet. The distribution of homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible, and segregating RILs conformed to segregation at a single locus. Seedlings and adult plant responses were correlated, indicating that the same gene conferred resistance at both stages. A bulk segregant analysis approach with widely distributed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers mapped the resistance gene to the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 4A. The SSR marker wmc776 cosegregated with this gene, whereas markers wmc219 and wmc313 were tightly linked and both located at 0.6 centimorgans. The resistance locus was designated Yr60.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is an important disease of wheat in Jammu and Kashmir state of India. The leading cultivars and breeding lines of wheat in the state were evaluated for stripe rust resistance at the experimental fields of the Faculty of Agriculture, Wadura. The study on molecular characterization and identification of candidate lines for stripe rust resistance genes Yr5, Yr10, Yr15 and Yr18 depicted that gene Yr5 was found in 14 entries, Yr10 in 29 entries, Yr15 in 25 entries and Yr18 in 9 entries including reference lines, while the susceptible control did not amplify any of the resistance genes used in the study. Single gene based resistance was detected in 9 entries, two gene based resistance was detected in 20 cultivars, three gene based resistance was detected in 8 cultivars and all four gene based resistance was detected in 1 cultivar (HPW-42). Such validation information is valuable and can efficiently be used in devising future breeding strategies in building a long lasting defense against stripe rust fungus.

AB Wheat leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) is one of the most important plant diseases in the world, and growing resistant cultivars is the most economical, effective and environmentally safe method for controlling this disease. With the aim of evaluating leaf rust resistance, 10 uncharacterized wheat genotypes, as well as 35 lines with known leaf rust resistance genes (Lr genes), were exposed to 12 Chinese P. triticina pathotypes at both seedling and adult stages. Two wheat genotypes, 09p205 and 09p200, showed high resistance to all the tested pathotypes at both seedling and adult stages. Three accessions, Xinmai 16, 00-225-2-1-2-2, and 21941-6, showed resistance at the adult stage. Four genotypes, 21898-3, 21924-4, 21915-3, and 21982-1, showed slow rusting resistance. In addition, 24 molecular markers were used to assess the presence of 20 known Lr genes. In the 10 genotypes analyzed Lr2c, Lr3ka, Lr9, Lr14a, Lr26, Lr34, and Lr37 were detected, either alone or in combination.

AB To better understand the contribution of the quantitative fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance locus, 2DL QTL from Wuhan-1, we have characterized two pairs of sister lines carrying either the 2DL QTL or no known QTLs. In wheat spikes, our visual and microscopic observations suggested that the 2DL QTL suppress fungal infection in inoculated spikelets and reduce spread from spikelets to rachis. Transcriptome profiling of infected spikelets showed changes in expression for 487 probe sets between the 2DL-carrying and the null lines. Of 27 transcripts selected for validation, eight candidate genes with similar expression profiles between the two pair of lines were identified. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a result of improvements in genome assembly algorithms and the ever decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing technologies, new high quality draft genome sequences are published at a striking pace. With well-established methodologies, larger and more complex genomes are being tackled, including polyploid plant genomes. Given the similarity between multiple copies of a basic genome in polyploid individuals, assembly of such data usually results in collapsed contigs that represent a variable number of homoeologous genomic regions. Unfortunately, such collapse is often not ideal, as keeping contigs separate can lead both to improved assembly and also insights about how haplotypes influence phenotype. Here, we describe a first step in avoiding inappropriate collapse during assembly. In particular, we describe ConPADE (Contig Ploidy and Allele Dosage Estimation), a probabilistic method that estimates the ploidy of any given contig/scaffold based on its allele proportions. In the process, we report findings regarding errors in sequencing. The method can be used for whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing data. We also show applicability of the method for variant calling and allele dosage estimation. Results for simulated and real data-sets are discussed and provide evidence that ConPADE performs well as long as enough sequencing coverage is available, or the true contig ploidy is low. We show that ConPADE may also be used for related applications, such as the identification of duplicated genes in fragmented assemblies, although refinements are needed.

AB Glutamine synthetase and asparagine synthetase are two master enzymes involved in ammonium assimilation in plants. Their roles in nitrogen remobilization and nitrogen use efficiency have been proposed. In this report, the genes coding for the cytosolic glutamine synthetases (HvGS1) and asparagine synthetases (HvASN) in barley were identified. In addition to the three HvGS1 and two HvASN sequences previously reported, two prokaryotic-like HvGS1 and three HvASN cDNA sequences were identified. Gene structures were then characterized, obtaining full genomic sequences. The response of the five HvGS1 and five HvASN genes to leaf senescence was then studied. Developmental senescence was studied using primary and flag leaves. Dark-exposure or low-nitrate conditions were also used to trigger stress-induced senescence. Well-known senescence markers such as the chlorophyll and Rubisco contents were monitored in order to characterize senescence levels in the different leaves. The three eukaryotic-like HvGS1_1, HvGS1_2, and HvGS1_3 sequences showed the typical senescence-induced reduction in gene expression described in many plant species. By contrast, the two prokaryotic-like HvGS1_4 and HvGS1_5 sequences were repressed by leaf senescence, similar to the HvGS2 gene, which encodes the chloroplast glutamine synthetase isoenzyme. There was a greater contrast in the responses of the five HvASN and this suggested that these genes are needed for N remobilization in senescing leaves only when plants are well fertilized with nitrate. Responses of the HvASN sequences to dark-induced senescence showed that there are two categories of asparagine synthetases, one induced in the dark and the other repressed by the same conditions.

AB The flowering in winter and wild wheats is induced by extended exposure to cold temperatures, a process called vernalization while spring wheats do not have any such requirement. In the present study, we analyzed 45 accessions of wild emmer wheat T dicoccoides for the allelic composition of the vernalization genes at VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 loci. Three gene based markers for VRN-Al and two for VRN-B1 locus were used. Thirty five T dicoccoides accessions had only winter type allele vrn-A1 at VRN-A1 locus. One accession each had VRNA1a and Vrn-A1d allele, and two accessions each showed the presence of VRN-A1b and Vrn-A1c, potent spring type alleles. Three accessions, however, had multiple alleles at VRN-Al locus. At the VRN-B1 locus 35 accessions had winter type allele vrn-B1 and 10 accession had dominant Vrn-B1 allele. These T dicoccoides accessions constitute a very useful resource for incorporation of alternative vernalization alleles in the cultivated wheat gene pool for developing better adaptive wheat varieties.

AB The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important food legume throughout the world. Because of the conservation across different plant species, it is possible to evaluate the degree of genetic diversity in the common bean using gene-based marker techniques. The lipoxygenase (LOX) and resistance gene analog (RGA) genes play an important role in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Eighty-six common bean accessions were genotyped using gene-based LOX and RGA markers. The total number of polymorphic bands ranged from 193 for LOX to 17 for RGA markers. We detected considerable diversity with a mean of 8.7 alleles per primer for the LOX analysis. For the RGA markers, the number of alleles per polymorphic locus varied from 1 to 4 with an average allele number of 2.8. The genetic similarity between the accessions based on the LOX and RGA markers ranged from 0.12 to 0.55. Using STRUCTURE, 3 groups were revealed among the accessions. The results of this study should provide valuable information for future studies on the genetic diversity of common bean accessions and for association mapping studies examining the relationships between the genotypic and phenotypic traits related to the stress response.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop among all cereals and consumed in major parts of the world as a staple food. The assessment of genetic diversity in wheat is of prime importance for conservation, breeding programs and to broaden the genetic makeup to develop high quality varieties. The present study aimed at the evaluation of evolutionary divergence pattern and genetic relationship among eight selected Pakistani wheat varieties based on a chloroplast gene. To achieve the main objective, rps 11 gene was amplified, sequenced and analyzed with the help of Bioinformatics tools. The constructed MEGA 5 phlogenetic tree revealed considerable level of genetic similarity among studied varieties with overall genetic distance of 0.05. The evolutionary divergence data based on pair wise distance analysis identified Chakwal-50 and Watan as most diverse varieties among all selected varieties. Phylogenetic relationship and genetic diversity concluded in this study based on rps 11 gene can be reliably used for assessing genetic kinship among wheat cultivars and to possibly change the direction of breeding programs in future.

AB This study reports the identification of a new gene conferring resistance to the Ug99 lineage of races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Because the virulent races of stem rust pathogen continue to pose a serious threat in global wheat production, identification and molecular characterization of new resistance genes remains of utmost important to enhance resistance diversity and durability in wheat germplasm. Advanced wheat breeding line 'ND643/2* Weebilll' carries a stem rust resistance gene, temporarily designated as SrND643, effective against the Ug99 group of P. graminis f. sp. tritici races at both seedling and adult growth stages. This study was conducted to map the chromosomal location of SrND643 and identify closely linked molecular markers to allow its selection in breeding populations. In total, 123 recombinant inbred lines, developed by crossing ND643/2* Weebilll with susceptible line ' Cacuke', were evaluated for stem rust response in field nurseries at Njoro, Kenya, during two growing seasons in 2010, and were genotyped with DNA markers, including Diversity Arrays Technology, simple sequence repeats (SSR), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Linkage mapping tagged SrND643 at the distal end of chromosome 4AL, showing close association with SSR markers Xgwm350 (0.5 centimorgans [cM]), Xwmc219 (4.1 cM), and Xwmc776 (2.9 cM). The race specificity of SrND643 is different from that of Sr7a and Sr7b, indicating that the resistance is conferred by a gene at a new locus or by a new allele of Sr7. The flanking markers Xgwm350 and Xwmc219 were predictive of the presence of SrND643 in advanced germplasm, thus validating the map location and their use in marker-assisted selection.

AB In barley, gene Rpg5 was first identified for providing resistance to the rye stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis). A subsequent study determined that Rpg5 is required for rpg4-mediated resistance to the wheat stem rust pathogen (P. graminis f. sp. tritici) including pathotype TTKSK ("Ug99"), which poses a major threat to global wheat and barley production. Based on the effectiveness of Rpg5 against P. graminis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. secalis, we assessed whether it also conferred resistance to the oat stem rust pathogen (P. graminis f. sp. avenae). A barley F8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was produced by crossing 'Q21861' (Rpgl and Rpg5) with '73-G1' (Rpgl), which is susceptible to P. graminis f. sp. avenae, P. graminis f. sp. secalis, and some pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. Seedling tests were performed on the F8 RIL population using Australian pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, P. graminis f. sp. secalis, P. graminis f. sp. avenae, and a putative somatic hybrid between P. graminis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. secalis known as the 'Scabrum' rust. Segregation in the responses to all rust isolates for the RILs was identical (50 resistant: 52 susceptible), and fitted a 1: 1 ratio (X-2 = 0.039, P = 0.843), indicating that resistance to all isolates was monogenetically inherited. Screening of the RILs and the parental lines with perfect markers for the functional Rpgl and Rpg5 resistance alleles indicated that Rpgl was fixed, while Rpg5 was positive in all resistant lines and negative in all susceptible lines. This suggests that different formae speciales of P. graminis may share common effectors, and that the Rpg5 locus confers resistance to both P. graminis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. secalis and the heterologous formae speciales of P. graminis, P. graminis f. sp. avenae.

AB A widely grown but rust susceptible Indian wheat variety HD2932 was improved for multiple rust resistance by marker-assisted transfer of genes Lr19, Sr26 and Yr10. Foreground and background selection processes were practised to transfer targeted genes with the recovery of the genome of HD2932. The near-isogenic lines (NILs) of HD2932 carrying Lr19, Sr26 and Yr10 were individually produced from two backcrosses with recurrent parent HD2932. Marker-assisted background selection of NILs with 94.38-98.46% of the HD2932 genome facilitated rapid recovery of NILs carrying Lr19, Sr26 and Yr10. In the BC2F2 generation, NILs were intercrossed and two gene combinations of Lr19+Yr10, Sr26 + Yr10 and Lr19+Sr26 were produced. A total of 16 progeny of two gene combinations of homozygous NILs of HD2932 have been produced, which are under seed increase for facilitating the replacement of the susceptible HD2932 with three of the sixteen improved backcross lines with resistance to multiple rusts.

AB Perception of pathogen (or microbe)-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a key component of plant innate immunity. The Arabidopsis PRR EF-Tu receptor (EFR) recognizes the bacterial PAMP elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and its derived peptide elf18. Previous work revealed that transgenic expression of AtEFR in Solanaceae confers elf18 responsiveness and broad-spectrum bacterial disease resistance. In this study, we developed a set of bioassays to study the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in wheat. We generated transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants expressing AtEFR driven by the constitutive rice actin promoter and tested their response to elf18. We show that transgenic expression of AtEFR in wheat confers recognition of elf18, as measured by the induction of immune marker genes and callose deposition. When challenged with the cereal bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv.oryzae, transgenic EFR wheat lines had reduced lesion size and bacterial multiplication. These results demonstrate that AtEFR can be transferred successfully from dicot to monocot species, further revealing that immune signalling pathways are conserved across these distant phyla. As novel PRRs are identified, their transfer between plant families represents a useful strategy for enhancing resistance to pathogens in crops.

AB A new gene for Ug99 resistance from wheat landrace PI 374670 was detected on the long arm of chromosome 7A.
   Wheat landrace PI 374670 has seedling and field resistance to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici Eriks. & E. Henn (Pgt) race TTKSK. To elucidate the inheritance of resistance, 216 BC1F2 families, 192 double haploid (DH) lines, and 185 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed by crossing PI 374670 and the susceptible line LMPG-6. The parents and progeny were evaluated for seedling resistance to Pgt races TTKSK, MCCFC, and TPMKC. The DH lines were tested in field stem rust nurseries in Kenya and Ethiopia. The DH lines were genotyped with the 90K wheat iSelect SNP genotyping platform. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that a single dominant gene in PI 374670 conditioned seedling resistance to the three Pgt races. The seedling resistance locus mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7A and this result was verified in the RIL population screened with the flanking SNP markers using KASP assays. In the same region, a major QTL for field resistance was detected in a 7.7 cM interval and explained 34-54 and 29-36 % of the variation in Kenya and Ethiopia, respectively. Results from tests with specific Pgt races and the csIH81 marker showed that the resistance was not due to Sr22. Thus, a new stem rust resistance gene or allele, either closely linked or allelic to Sr15, is responsible for the seedling and field resistance of PI 374670 to Ug99.

AB An allele of Pm2 for wheat powdery mildew resistance was identified in a putative Agropyron cristatum -derived line and used in wheat breeding programs.
   Powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) is one of the most devastating wheat diseases worldwide. It is important to exploit varied sources of resistance from common wheat and its relatives in resistance breeding. KM2939, a Chinese breeding line, exhibits high resistance to powdery mildew at both the seedling and adult stages. It carries a single dominant powdery mildew resistance (Pm) allele of Pm2, designated Pm2b, the previous allelic designation Pm2 will be re-designated as Pm2a. Pm2b was mapped to chromosome arm 5DS and flanked by sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers SCAR112 and SCAR203 with genetic distances of 0.5 and 1.3 cM, respectively. Sequence tagged site (STS) marker Mag6176 and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker Cfd81 co-segregated with SCAR203. Pm2b differs in specificity from donors of Pm2a, Pm46 and PmLX66 on chromosome arm 5DS. Allelism tests indicated that Pm2b, Pm2a and PmLX66 are allelic. Therefore, Pm2b appears to be a new allele at the Pm2 locus. The closely linked markers were used to accelerate transfer of Pm2b to wheat cultivars in current production.

AB The diploid wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr21 confers temperature-sensitive resistance to isolates of the Ug99 group and maps to the middle of the long arm of chromosome 2A (m) .
   A race of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal pathogen of stem rust of wheat, known as Ug99, and its variants, are virulent to plants carrying stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in most wheat cultivars worldwide. Therefore, identification, mapping and deployment of effective resistance genes are critical to reduce this threat. Resistance gene Sr21 identified in diploid wheat T. monococcum can be effective against races from the Ug99 race group, but both susceptible and partial resistant reactions have been reported in previous studies. To clarify this conflicting information we screened four monogenic lines with Sr21 and four susceptible controls with 16 Pgt isolates including five isolates of the Ug99 race group under three different temperatures and three different photoperiods. We observed that, temperature influences the interaction between monogenic lines with Sr21 and Ug99 race group isolates, and may be one source of previous inconsistencies. This result indicates that, although Sr21 confers partial resistance against Ug99, its effectiveness can be modulated by environmental conditions and should not be deployed alone. Using two large diploid wheat-mapping populations (total 3,788 F-2 plants) we mapped Sr21 approximately 50 cM from the centromere on the long arm of chromosome 2A(m) within a 0.20 cM interval flanked by sequence-based markers FD527726 and EX594406. The closely linked markers identified in this study will be useful to reduce the T. monococcum segments introgressed into common wheat, accelerate Sr21 deployment in wheat breeding programs, and facilitate the map-based cloning of this gene.

AB This work laid the foundation for cloning of shattering gene Br2 and provided first line of evidence that two major Aegilops tauschii lineages are differentiated by an inversion polymorphism.
   Chromosome inversions often accompany population differentiation and capture local adaptation during speciation. Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor species of hexaploid wheat, consists of two genetically isolated lineages, L1 and L2, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying the population differentiation in this diploid species. During fine mapping of the shattering gene Br2 using a large F-2 population derived from a cross between TA1604 (an L1 accession) and AL8/78 (an L2 accession), we found contrasting patterns of crossover distribution in the Br2 interval and neighboring regions despite the high local gene synteny with Brachypodium distachyon and rice. Br2 was localized in a 0.08-cM interval, and 13 marker loci formed a block, where single-crossovers were completely suppressed, but double-crossovers were enriched with a recombination rate of 11 cM/Mb. In contrast, in a neighboring region no double-crossover was recovered, but single-crossover rate reached 24 cM/Mb, which is much higher than the genome-wide average. This result suggests a putative inversion polymorphism between the parental lines in the Br2 region. Genotyping using the markers from the Br2 region divided a collection of 55 randomly sampled A. tauschii accessions into two major groups, and they are largely genetically isolated. The two groups correspond to the L1 and L2 lineages based on their geographic distribution patterns. This provides first evidence that inversions may underlie the evolution of A. tauschii lineages. The presence of inter-lineage inversions may complicate map-based cloning in A. tauschii and transfer of useful traits to wheat.

AB To maximize heterosis, it is important to understand the genetic diversity of germplasm and associate useful phenotypic traits such as fertility restoration for hybrid rice breeding. The objectives of the present study were to characterize genetic diversity within a set of rice germplasm groups using coefficient of parentage (COP) values and 58 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for 124 genotypes having different attributes such as resistance/tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. These lines were also used for identifying prospective restorers and maintainers for wild abortive-cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line. The mean COP value for all the lines was 0.11, indicating that the genotypes do not share common ancestry. The SSR analysis generated a total of 268 alleles with an average of 4.62 alleles per locus. The mean polymorphism information content value was 0.53, indicating that the markers selected were highly polymorphic. Grouping based on COP analysis revealed three major clusters pertaining to the indica, tropical japonica and japonica lines. A similar grouping pattern with some variation was also observed for the SSR markers. Fertility restoration phenotype based on the test cross of the 124 genotypes with a CMS line helped identify 23 maintainers, 58 restorers and 43 genotypes as either partial maintainers or partial restorers. This study demonstrates that COP analysis along with molecular marker analysis might encourage better organization of germplasm diversity and its use in hybrid rice breeding. Potential restorers identified in the study can be used for breeding high-yielding stress-tolerant medium-duration rice hybrids, while maintainers would prove useful for developing new rice CMS lines.

AB Background: In order to clarify the origin of spring growth habit in modern domesticated wheat, allelic variability of the VRN-1 gene was investigated in a wide set of accessions of the wild tetraploid species Triticum dicoccoides (BBAA), together with diploid species T. monococcum, T. boeoticum and T. urartu, presumable donors of the A genome to polyploid wheats.
   Results: No significant variation was found at the VRN-B1 locus of T. dicoccoides, whereas at VRN-A1 a number of previously described alleles were found with small deletions in the promoter (VRN-A1b, VRN-A1d) or a large deletion in the first (1st) intron (VRN-A1L). The diploid A genome species were characterized by their own set of VRN-1 alleles including previously described VRN-A1f and VRN-A1h alleles with deletions in the promoter region and the VRN-A1ins allele containing a 0.5 kb insertion in the 1st intron. Based on the CAPS screening data, alleles VRN-A1f and VRN-A1ins were species-specific for T. monococcum, while allele VRN-A1h was specific for T. boeoticum. Different indels were revealed in both the promoter and 1st intron of the recessive VRN-A1u allele providing specific identification of T. urartu, the proposed donor of the A genome to modern wheat. We found that alleles VRN-A1b and VRN-A1h, previously described as dominant, have either no or weak association with spring growth habit, while in some diploid accessions this habit was associated with the recessive VRN-A1 allele.
   Conclusions: Spring growth habit in diploid wheats was only partially associated with indels in regulatory regions of the VRN-1 gene. An exception is T. monococcum where dominant mutations in both the promoter region and, especially, the 1st intron were selected during domestication resulting in a greater variety of spring forms. The wild tetraploid T. dicoccoides had a distinct set of VRN-A1 alleles compared to the diploids in this study, indicating an independent origin of spring tetraploid forms that likely occurred after combining of diploid genomes. These alleles were subsequently inherited by cultivated polyploid (tetraploid and hexaploid) descendants.

AB Stored product beetles that are resistant to the fumigant pesticide phosphine (hydrogen phosphide) gas have been reported for more than 40 years in many places worldwide. Traditionally, determination of phosphine resistance in stored product beetles is based on a discriminating dose bioassay that can take up to two weeks to evaluate. We developed a diagnostic cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence method, CAPS, to detect individuals with alleles for strong resistance to phosphine in populations of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, according to a single nucleotide mutation in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene. We initially isolated and sequenced the DLD genes from susceptible and strongly resistant populations of both species. The corresponding amino acid sequences were then deduced. A single amino acid mutation in DLD in populations of T. castaneum and R. dominica with strong resistance was identified as P45S in T. castaneum and P49S in R. dominica, both collected from northern Oklahoma, USA. PCR products containing these mutations were digested by the restriction enzymes MboI and BstNI, which revealed presence or absence, respectively of the resistant (R) allele and allowed inference of genotypes with that allele. Seven populations of T. castaneum from Kansas were subjected to discriminating dose bioassays for the weak and strong resistance phenotypes. Application of CAPS to these seven populations confirmed the R allele was in high frequency in the strongly resistant populations, and was absent or at a lower frequency in populations with weak resistance, which suggests that these populations with a low frequency of the R allele have the potential for selection of the strong resistance phenotype. CAPS markers for strong phosphine resistance will help to detect and confirm resistant beetles and can facilitate resistance management actions against a given pest population.

AB Background: The Lolium-Festuca complex incorporates species from the Lolium genera and the broad leaf fescues, both belonging to the subfamily Pooideae. This subfamily also includes wheat, barley, oat and rye, making it extremely important to world agriculture. Species within the Lolium-Festuca complex show very diverse phenotypes, and many of them are related to agronomically important traits. Analysis of sequenced transcriptomes of these non-model species may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic diversity.
   Results: We have generated de novo transcriptome assemblies for four species from the Lolium-Festuca complex, ranging from 52,166 to 72,133 transcripts per assembly. We have also predicted a set of proteins and validated it with a high-confidence protein database from three closely related species (H. vulgare, B. distachyon and O. sativa). We have obtained gene family clusters for the four species using OrthoMCL and analyzed their inferred phylogenetic relationships. Our results indicate that VRN2 is a candidate gene for differentiating vernalization and non-vernalization types in the Lolium-Festuca complex. Grouping of the gene families based on their BLAST identity enabled us to divide ortholog groups into those that are very conserved and those that are more evolutionarily relaxed. The ratio of the non-synonumous to synonymous substitutions enabled us to pinpoint protein sequences evolving in response to positive selection. These proteins may explain some of the differences between the more stress tolerant Festuca, and the less stress tolerant Lolium species.
   Conclusions: Our data presents a comprehensive transcriptome sequence comparison between species from the Lolium-Festuca complex, with the identification of potential candidate genes underlying some important phenotypical differences within the complex (such as VRN2). The orthologous genes between the species have a very high %id (91,61%) and the majority of gene families were shared for all of them. It is likely that the knowledge of the genomes will be largely transferable between species within the complex.

AB Background: In plant breeding, there are two primary applications for DNA markers in selection: 1) selection of known genes using a single marker assay (marker-assisted selection; MAS); and 2) whole-genome profiling and prediction (genomic selection; GS). Typically, marker platforms have addressed only one of these objectives.
   Results: We have developed spiked genotyping-by-sequencing (sGBS), which combines targeted amplicon sequencing with reduced representation genotyping-by-sequencing. To minimize the cost of targeted assays, we utilize a small percent of sequencing capacity available in runs of GBS libraries to "spike" amplified targets of a priori alleles tagged with a different set of unique barcodes. This open platform allows multiple, single-target loci to be assayed while simultaneously generating a whole-genome profile. This dual-genotyping approach allows different sets of samples to be evaluated for single markers or whole genome-profiling. Here, we report the application of sGBS on a winter wheat panel that was screened for converted KASP markers and newly-designed markers targeting known polymorphisms in the leaf rust resistance gene Lr34.
   Conclusions: The flexibility and low-cost of sGBS will enable a range of applications across genetics research. Specifically in breeding applications, the sGBS approach will allow breeders to obtain a whole-genome profile of important individuals while simultaneously targeting specific genes for a range of selection strategies across the breeding program.

TI Genes Expressed in Grapevine Leaves Reveal Latent Wood Infection by the
   Fungal Pathogen Neofusicoccum parvum

   DISEASES; DIEBACK; PLANT; BOTRYOSPHAERIACEAE; TRANSCRIPTOME; RESPONSES
AB Some pathogenic species of the Botryosphaeriaceae have a latent phase, colonizing woody tissues while perennial hosts show no apparent symptoms until conditions for disease development become favorable. Detection of these pathogens is often limited to the later pathogenic phase. The latent phase is poorly characterized, despite the need for non-destructive detection tools and effective quarantine strategies, which would benefit from identification of host-based markers in leaves. Neofusicoccum parvum infects the wood of grapevines and other horticultural crops, killing the fruit-bearing shoots. We used light microscopy and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to examine the spatiotemporal relationship between pathogen colonization and anatomical changes in stem sections. To identify differentially-expressed grape genes, leaves from inoculated and noninoculated plants were examined using RNA-Seq. The latent phase occurred between 0 and 1.5 months post-inoculation (MPI), during which time the pathogen did not spread significantly beyond the inoculation site nor were there differences in lesion lengths between inoculated and non-inoculated plants. The pathogenic phase occurred between 1.5 and 2 MPI, when recovery beyond the inoculation site increased and lesion lengths of inoculated plants tripled. By 2 MPI, inoculated plants also had decreased starch content in xylem fibers and rays, and increased levels of gel-occluded xylem vessels, the latter of which HRCT revealed at a higher frequency than microscopy. RNA-Seq and screening of 21 grape expression datasets identified 20 candidate genes that were transcriptionally-activated by infection during the latent phase, and confirmed that the four best candidates (galactinol synthase, abscisic acid-induced wheat plasma membrane polypeptide-19 ortholog, embryonic cell protein 63, BURP domain-containing protein) were not affected by a range of common foliar and wood pathogens or abiotic stresses. Assuming such host responses are consistent among cultivars, and do not cross react with other trunk/foliar pathogens, these grape genes may serve as host-based markers of the latent phase of N. parvum infection.

AB Intensive breeding has led to a narrowing in the genetic base of our major crops. In wheat, access to the extensive gene pool residing in its many and varied relatives (some cultivated, others wild) is hampered by the block on recombination imposed by the Phi (Pairing homoeologous 1) gene. Here, the ph1b mutant has been exploited to induced allosyndesis between wheat chromosomes and those of both Hordeum vulgare (cultivated barley) and H. chilense (a wild barley). A number of single chromosome Hordeum sp. substitution and addition lines in wheat were crossed and backcrossed to the ph1b mutant to produce plants in which pairing between the wheat and the non-wheat chromosomes was not suppressed by the presence of Phi. Genomic in situ hybridization was applied to almost 500 BC1F2 progeny as a screen for allosyndetic recombinants. Chromosome rearrangements were detected affecting H. chilense chromosomes 4H(ch), 5H(ch), 6H(ch) and 7H(ch) and H. vulgare chromosomes 4H(v), 6H(v), and 7H(v). Two of these were clearly the product of a recombination event involving chromosome 4H(ch) and a wheat chromosome.

AB Background: A high-throughput genotyping platform is needed to enable marker-assisted breeding in the allo-octoploid cultivated strawberry Fragaria x ananassa. Short-read sequences from one diploid and 19 octoploid accessions were aligned to the diploid Fragaria vesca 'Hawaii 4' reference genome to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels for incorporation into a 90 K Affymetrix (R) Axiom (R) array. We report the development and preliminary evaluation of this array.
   Results: About 36 million sequence variants were identified in a 19 member, octoploid germplasm panel. Strategies and filtering pipelines were developed to identify and incorporate markers of several types: di-allelic SNPs (66.6%), multi-allelic SNPs (1.8%), indels (10.1%), and ploidy-reducing "haploSNPs" (11.7%). The remaining SNPs included those discovered in the diploid progenitor F. iinumae (3.9%), and speculative "codon-based" SNPs (5.9%). In genotyping 306 octoploid accessions, SNPs were assigned to six classes with Affymetrix's "SNPolisher" R package. The highest quality classes, PolyHigh Resolution (PHR), No Minor Homozygote (NMH), and Off-Target Variant (OTV) comprised 25%, 38%, and 1% of array markers, respectively. These markers were suitable for genetic studies as demonstrated in the full-sib family 'Holiday' x 'Korona' with the generation of a genetic linkage map consisting of 6,594 PHR SNPs evenly distributed across 28 chromosomes with an average density of approximately one marker per 0.5 cM, thus exceeding our goal of one marker per cM.
   Conclusions: The Affymetrix IStraw90 Axiom array is the first high-throughput genotyping platform for cultivated strawberry and is commercially available to the worldwide scientific community. The array's high success rate is likely driven by the presence of naturally occurring variation in ploidy level within the nominally octoploid genome, and by effectiveness of the employed array design and ploidy-reducing strategies. This array enables genetic analyses including generation of high-density linkage maps, identification of quantitative trait loci for economically important traits, and genome-wide association studies, thus providing a basis for marker-assisted breeding in this high value crop.

AB Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum are phytopathogenic species causing scab and root rot diseases in all small grain cereals worldwide including Turkey. In this study, resistance levels to geneticin (G418) of 14 F. graminearum and 24 F. culmorum isolates collected from cereals were determined. Fungal cultures were grown on potato dextrose agar medium supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mu g/mL of G418. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as 25 mu g/mL. As a result, it was concluded that all isolates were highly sensitive to G418. Plasmid pFA6-kanmx4 containing geneticin resistance gene (kanmx) was introduced singly or co-electroporated with pEGFP75 plasmid, containing GFP gene, into fungal protoplast cultures obtained with lytic enzyme. Transformants were grown in media including 25 mu g/mL G418. Transformation frequencies were 2.8 and 1.8 transformant per mu g plasmid for F. graminearum and F. culmorum isolates, respectively. Transformation process was also confirmed by spectrofluorimetric assay. Relative fluorescence unit values in co-transformants were calculated as 1.87 +/- 0.04 for F. graminearum and 2.26 +/- 0.08 for F. culmorum. The results obtained from the study gave information about antibiotic resistance levels of two Fusarium species in Turkey. Moreover, it was shown that pFA6-kanmx4 plasmid was a suitable vector, which can be used in genetic manipulation studies of these two fungal species in particular suppression of endogenous and/or the expression of exogenous genes.

AB Functional markers (FMs) developed from sequence polymorphisms are present in allelic variants of a functional gene at a locus and are directly associated with phenotypic variations. In this study, FM linked to Rht-B1, Rht-D1, TaCwi-A1, TaSus2-2B, TaGW2-6A and Dreb-B1 genes conferring to yield potential and water-saving were selected to analyse the distribution in 102 wheat varieties, most of which were authorized in the past decade and adapted to grow in Zone II of China. First, the semi-dwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b (mutant alleles) conferring to grain yield were analysed. The frequencies of favourable alleles Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b were 32.4 and 58.8%, respectively. Comparing with the previous report, the frequency of Rht-B1b among cultivars in this study is similar to the frequency among cultivars released in the 1990s, while the frequency of Rht-D1b is slightly lower than the previous report 63.9%. Twelve (11.8%) cultivars neither contained Rht-B1b nor Rht-D1b, while only Yumai 66 contained both semidwarfing genes. Linyuan8 and Xinong 928 are heterozygous at RhtB1 locus and Zhengmai 9023 is heterozygous at both RhtB1 and Rht-D1 loci. Second, the TaCwi-A1, TaSus2-2B and TaGW2-6A genes considered as candidate genes related to grain weight were detected. We found that the frequencies of the favourable alleles were 76.5, 56.9 and 69.6%, respectively. Among the 102 wheat varieties, 30 contained all the three favourable genes, 45 contained two of the three favourable genes and 27 contained only one. There are eight wheat varieties (7.8%) in hybrid state at the TaCWI-A1 locus. Third, the designed FM linked to water-saving gene Dreb-B1 were validated on 102 wheat varieties. The results showed that the haplotypes of 47 wheat varieties at the Dreb-B1 locus were same as that of Opata 85, and 55 wheat varieties showed the signal expected for W7984 (Opata 85 and W7984 are parents of the ITMI mapping population). This information will be useful for the wheat breeding programmes aiming at improving yield and water use efficiency in Shijiazhuang located in China Zone II.

AB Studies were initiated to induce homoeologous recombination between the 6Ae#1L chromosome segment from Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Barkw. & D. R. Dewey carrying the stem rust resistance gene Sr26 and homoeologous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosomes. The research was undertaken in an attempt to restore the yielding potential of wheat lines carrying Sr26. DNA probes mapping to chromosome arm 6L of Triticeae species were screened for chromosome 6Ae#1-specific markers. Thirty out of 32 probes showed useful polymorphisms. A total of 1406 seedlings in a ph1bph1b background were screened for the presence of homoeologous recombinants with 24 of the polymorphic probes, as well as the 6Ae#1 isozyme markers for aconitase and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and stem rust resistance. Eleven genotypes were found to have reduced amounts of 6Ae#1 chromatin and seven of these were resistant to stem rust (+ Sr26). Six lines were homoeologous recombinants involving wheat chromosome 6A and four lines involved crossovers with 6D. The physical location of Sr26 was determined to be on the extreme distal segment of the 6Ae#1 chromosome. Rust resistant lines carrying shortened 6Ae#1 segments with improved agronomic performance are now being utilized by wheat breeding programs in several countries.

AB Russian wheat aphid (RWA, Diuraphis noxia, Mordvilko) biotype 2 (RWA2) is virulent to most known RWA resistance genes and severely threatens wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the hard winter wheat area of the U.S. western Great Plains. We determined RWA2 reactions of 386 cultivars from China, 227 advanced breeding lines and recently released cultivars from the United States, 505 landraces from countries where RWA is endemic, and 31 genetic stocks developed in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Russia. The majority of wheat accessions from China and the United States were highly susceptible to RWA2. Only nine landrace accessions produced a homogeneous resistant reaction. In addition, highly resistant plants were identified in 28 heterogeneous landraces. Thus, reselection was conducted to purify some potential resistance sources, and the single-plant progenies of 220 selected plants were evaluated. Homogeneous resistant or highly resistant lines were identified from seven previously heterogeneous landraces. Reselection line PI 626759-20-32 offered a high level of resistance similar to lines carrying Dn7, the rye (Secale cereale L.)-derived resistance gene associated with undesirable bread-making quality. PI 626759-20-32 has the potential to supplement or replace Dn7 as a new RWA2 resistance source in wheat breeding.

AB To identify races of Puccinia triticina in southern Africa, samples of infected wheat leaves obtained from Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi were analysed at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein and the Agricultural Research Council-Small Grain Institute, Bethlehem, South Africa (SA). Four races were identified from 63 isolates obtained during 2011-2013. Using the North American notation, these races coded to MCDS (74.6 %), TCPS (12.7 %), FBPT (6.3 %) and SCDS (6.3 %). MCDS and TCPS occurred in both Zimbabwe and Zambia whereas FBPT and SCDS were only detected in Zimbabwe and Malawi, respectively. Three of these races (MCDS, FPBT and SCDS) are also known in SA. SSR analysis of races detected in southern Africa suggested that MCDS and FPBT are more closely related to CCPS (3SA45), a race identified in SA in 2009. Occurrence of similar races across southern Africa indicates migration of inoculum between countries, and highlights the need for each country to monitor and share information on virulence changes in the region. In seedling tests, over 72 % of Zimbabwean commercial cultivars were susceptible to race TCPS which occurred in both Zimbabwe and Zambia. To predict occurrence of adult plant resistance (APR) in these cultivars, they were tested for the presence of gene Lr34 which confers durable resistance to multiple fungal pathogens. Only three cultivars were positive for this gene suggesting that most of the current Zimbabwean commercial cultivars may be susceptible to leaf rust both as seedlings and adult plants, assuming the absence of other APR genes. Three cultivars and 15 breeding lines, all highly resistant as seedlings across races, carried Lr19. One line contained Lr19 and Lr34. It is suggested that sources of race nonspecific resistance genes be included in wheat breeding programs in Zimbabwe.

AB Grain color of wheat is one of the most important economic traits, affecting both flour quality and grain dormancy. As grain color reflects the phenotype of the seed coat, which is a maternal tissue, genotyping of this trait in segregating F-2 plants requires an F-3 progeny test. Consequently, the development of co-dominant molecular markers for grain color enables genotyping on a single grain basis and would expedite wheat breeding. R-1 genes control grain color and have been identified as MYB-type transcription factors, denoted as Tamyb10, which reside on the 3A, 3B, and 3D chromosomes, respectively. In an earlier study we developed co-dominant markers for R-A1 and R-B1 on chromosomes 3A and 3B, but could only develop one dominant marker for R-D1 because the mutant allele deleted the entire Tamyb10-D1 fragment with an unknown deletion size. DNA of individuals of the F-2 population derived from crossing the white-grained line, 1-117, and the red-grained line, OW104, was isolated and used for real-time PCR. Relative amplification ratios of Tamyb10-D1 to Tamyb10-B1 in each of 96 individuals showed a bimodal distribution without overlapping, which allowed unequivocal classification of the F-2 plants into a 1.0 (dominant homozygous) or a 0.5 (heterozygous) class, in accordance with a 1: 2 expected ratio. Genotypes with the R-D1 grain color (4 plants per each class) were tested by an F-3 progeny test. The results perfectly coincided with the genotypes deduced by the real-time PCR diagnosis. Consequently, the hemizygous status at the Tamyb10-D1 locus controlling grain color in wheat can now be diagnosed with the real-time PCR.

AB Future barley cultivars will have to produce under the constraints of higher temperature in combination with increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ozone as a consequence of climate change. A diverse set of 167 spring barley genotypes was cultivated under elevated levels of temperature (+5 degrees C) and [CO2] (700 ppm) as single factors and in combination as well as under elevated [O-3] (100-150 ppb) as single factor. The setting in general resembled changes projected by IPCC (AR5) to take place at the end of this century. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify markers for increased primary production under climate change conditions and reveal possible genes of interest. Phenotyped traits included grain yield, number of grains, number of ears per plant, above-ground vegetative biomass, harvest index and stability of the production parameters over the five applied treatments. The GWAS encompassed 7864 SNP markers (Illumina iselect), a compressed mixed linear model with the GAPIT package, and conservative validation of markers. A total of 60 marker-trait associations [-log(10)(P value) 2.97-5.58] were identified, e.g. grain yield under elevated temperature on barley chromosome 2H, static stability of grain yield on 7H, sites for exploitation of elevated [CO2] on 4H and 7H and associations under the two-factor treatment. Marker-trait associations identified from single-factor treatments were not retrieved, when elevated [CO2] and temperature were combined emphasizing the need for multifactor experiments. This GWA study identified markers and chromosome regions to be targeted in breeding for development of climate resilient cultivars.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in many cool and temperate regions of the world. Resistant cultivars are the most effective, economical and environmentally friendly means of controlling the disease. Chinese wheat cultivar Mianmai 37 is resistant at all growth stages to all prevalent Chinese Pst races including v26, a new Pst race virulent to resistance genes Yr24/Yr26. Genetic analysis of the F1, F2 and F2: 3 populations from a cross between Mianmai 37 and susceptible line Mingxian 169 indicated that resistance to Pst race v26 was conferred by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated yrMY37. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker analysis placed yrMY37 on chromosome 7BL near the centromere. Eight co-dominant genomic SSR markers, Xgwm400, Xwmc758, Xwmc476, Xgwm297, Xbarc267, Xwmc364, Xwmc696 and Xwmc396, were linked with yrMY37. The closest SSR loci Xbarc267 and Xgwm297 flanked the resistance gene at 0.38 and 0.78 cM, respectively. A seedling test with 22 Pst races indicated that the reaction patterns of Mianmai 37 were different from those of lines carrying resistance genes Yr2, Yr6, Yr67 and YrZH84 on chromosome 7B. As there is no recessive stripe rust resistance gene reported on 7BL so far, we believe that yrMY37 is most likely a new stripe rust resistance gene.

AB A collection of spring hexaploid triticale cultivars and promising breeding lines has been examined for the presence of wheat Rht-B1b, Rht-B1e, and Rht8c semidwarfing genes and the rye Hl semidwarfing gene. It was discovered in spring triticale that these semidwarfing genes are represented by only one, the Rht-B1b wheat gene. The presence of this gene is associated with shortening of spring triticale plants by 28 cm on average, which constituted 26% of their initial height. Rht-B1b was found in all of the studied commercial cultivars of spring triticale, which rendered it possible to conclude that plant height reduction is a necessary condition for increasing the competitiveness of this crop culture.

AB A complete SGP null mutant (Sgp-A1B1D1 null) winter wheat line was crossed with three wheat varieties: Ukrainka', Lona' and Solstice'. Three backcrosses (BCs) were carried out and marker assisted selection used to identify lines carrying all the three mutant alleles for each cross. BC3 and BC(2)xBC(2) F-3,F- F-4 and F-5 lines (2012-2014) were studied in detail for physical (thousand kernel weight), compositional (protein, gluten, amylose) and starch viscosity properties (rapid visco analyser-RVA). Ten triple mutant high-amylose lines (approximate to 40%) were identified among the BC(2)xBC(2) lines, which had high protein content (>14%), low starch content, gluten index, starch viscosity values and thousand kernel weight. Two of these lines had moderately high amylose (approximate to 30%) content, with outstanding gluten quality, but modified starch viscosity properties.

AB Genetic diversity was investigated in a set of thirty-three hexaploid wheat genotypes originated from Egypt, using 17 wheat microsatellites, representatives of fifteen wheat chromosomes. In total, ninety-five alleles were detected among Egyptian wheats. For 17 polymorphic microsatellite markers, the number of alleles per locus varied from 3 for Xgwm261-2DS, Xgwm3-3DL and Xgwm631-7AS to 11 for Xgwm437-7DL, with a mean of 5.59 alleles per locus. The highest average number of alleles per locus was detected in the B genome with 6.00, compared to 5.67 and 5.00 for genomes D and A, respectively. The highest and the lowest average number of alleles per locus among the wheat homoeologous groups were observed in group 7 and 3 with 7.00 and 4.00, respectively. Gene diversity for 17 microsatellites loci varied from 0.339 for Xgwm631-7AS to 0.845 for Xtaglgap-1BS with an average of 0.653. However, the gene diversity for three genomes A, B and D was 0.549, 0.718 and 0.674, respectively. A significant correlation coefficient between gene diversity and the number of alleles per locus, genomes and homoeologous groups was high, r = 0.649, 0.988 and 0.272 (P < 0.01), respectively. The gene diversity increased as the number of alleles increased. Cluster analysis was conducted based on microsatellites data. Five groups can be distinguished by truncating the dendrogram at genetic similarity (gs) value of 0.48. The present study indicated the presence of high diversity in Egyptian wheat genotypes.

AB Mapping studies confirm that resistance to Ug99 race of stem rust pathogen in Aegilops tauschii accession Clae 25 is conditioned by Sr46 and markers linked to the gene were developed for marker-assisted selection.
   The race TTKSK (Ug99) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal pathogen for wheat stem rust, is considered as a major threat to global wheat production. To address this threat, researchers across the world have been devoted to identifying TTKSK-resistant genes. Here, we report the identification and mapping of a stem rust resistance gene in Aegilops tauschii accession CIae 25 that confers resistance to TTKSK and the development of molecular markers for the gene. An F-2 population of 710 plants from an Ae. tauschii cross CIae 25 x AL8/78 were first evaluated against race TPMKC. A set of 14 resistant and 116 susceptible F-2:3 families from the F-2 plants were then evaluated for their reactions to TTKSK. Based on the tests, 179 homozygous susceptible F-2 plants were selected as the mapping population to identify the simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers linked to the gene by bulk segregant analysis. A dominant stem rust resistance gene was identified and mapped with 16 SSR and five new STS markers to the deletion bin 2DS5-0.47-1.00 of chromosome arm 2DS in which Sr46 was located. Molecular marker and stem rust tests on CIae 25 and two Ae. tauschii accessions carrying Sr46 confirmed that the gene in CIae 25 is Sr46. This study also demonstrated that Sr46 is temperature-sensitive being less effective at low temperatures. The marker validation indicated that two closely linked markers Xgwm210 and Xwmc111 can be used for marker-assisted selection of Sr46 in wheat breeding programs.

AB The wheat association mapping initiative is appropriate for gene discovery without the confounding effects of phenology and plant height.
   The wheat association mapping initiative (WAMI) population is a set of 287 diverse advanced wheat lines with a narrow range of variation for days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH). This study aimed to characterize the WAMI and showed that this diverse panel has a favorable genetic background in which stress adaptive traits and their alleles contributing to final yield can be identified with reduced confounding major gene effects through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we observed lower gene diversity on the D genome, compared with the other genomes. Population structure was primarily related to the distribution of the 1B.1R rye translocation. The narrow range of variation for DH and PH in the WAMI population still entailed segregation for a few markers associated with the former traits, while Rht genes were associated with grain yield (GY). Genotype by environment (G x E) interaction for GY was primarily explained by Rht-B1, Vrn-A1 and markers on chromosomes 2D and 3A when running GWAS with genotype scores from the G x E biplot. The use of PC scores from the G x E biplot seems a promising tool to determine genes and markers associated with complex interactions across environments. The WAMI panel lends itself to GWAS for complex trait dissection by avoiding the confounding effects of DH and PH which were reduced to a minimum (using Rht-B1 and Vrn-A1 scores as covariables), with significant associations with GY on chromosomes 2D, 3A and 3B.

AB A new powdery mildew resistance gene Pm54 was identified on chromosome 6BL in soft red winter wheat.
   Powdery mildew is causing increasing damage to wheat production in the southeastern USA. To combat the disease, a continuing need exists to discover new genes for powdery mildew resistance and to incorporate those genes into breeding programs. Pioneer(A (R)) variety 26R61 (shortened as 26R61) and AGS 2000 have been used as checks in the Uniform Southern Soft Red Winter Wheat Nursery for a decade, and both have provided good resistance across regions during that time. In the present study, a genetic analysis of mildew resistance was conducted on a RIL population developed from a cross of 26R61 and AGS 2000. Phenotypic evaluation was conducted in the field at Plains, GA, and Raleigh, NC, in 2012 and 2013, a total of four environments. Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effect were consistently detected on wheat chromosomes 2BL, 4A and 6BL. The 2BL QTL contributed by 26R61 was different from Pm6, a widely used gene in the southeastern USA. The other two QTL were identified from AGS 2000. The 6BL QTL was subsequently characterized as a simple Mendelian factor when the population was inoculated with a single Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolate in controlled environments. Since there is no known powdery mildew resistance gene (Pm) on this particular location of common wheat, the gene was designated Pm54. The closely linked marker Xbarc134 was highly polymorphic in a set of mildew differentials, indicating that the marker should be useful for pyramiding Pm54 with other Pm genes by marker-assisted selection.

AB Powdery resistance putatively derived from Thinopyrum intermedium in the wheat line L962 is controlled by a single dominant gene designated PmL962 and mapped to chromosome arm 2BS.
   Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a destructive disease affecting the production of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Powdery mildew resistance was putatively transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium to the common wheat line L962, which conferred resistance to multiple Chinese Bgt isolates. Genetic analysis of the powdery mildew response was conducted by crossing the resistant line L962 with the susceptible line L983. Disease assessments of the F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 populations from the cross L983/L962 indicated that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. A total of 373 F-2:3 lines and 781 pairs of genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were employed to determine the chromosomal location of the resistance gene. The gene was linked to four publicly available and recently developed wheat genomic SSR markers and seven EST-STS markers. The resistance gene was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS based on the locations of the linked markers. Pedigree, molecular marker and resistance response data indicated that the powdery mildew resistance gene in L962 is novel. It was temporarily designated PmL962. It is flanked by Xwmc314 and BE443737at genetic distances of 2.09 and 3.74 cM, respectively, and located in a 20.77 cM interval that is co-linear with a 269.4 kb genomic region on chromosome 5 in Brachypodium distachyon and a 223.5 kb genomic region on rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 4. The markers that are closely linked to this gene have potential applications in marker-assisted breeding.

It was also highly resistant to both rusts at adult plant stage in field trials in Mexico. The genetic basis of this resistance was investigated in a population of 148 F-5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Avocet x Sujata. The parents and RIL population were characterized in field trials for resistance to leaf rust during 2011 at El Batan, and 2012 and 2013 at Ciudad Obregn, Mexico, and for stripe rust during 2011 and 2012 at Toluca, Mexico; they were also characterized three times for stripe rust at seedling stage in the greenhouse. The RILs were genotyped with diversity arrays technology and simple sequence repeat markers. The final genetic map was constructed with 673 polymorphic markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping analysis detected two new significant co-located resistance loci, QLr.cim-1AS/QYr.cim-1AS and QLr.cim-7BL/YrSuj, on chromosomes 1AS and 7BL, respectively. The chromosomal position of QLr.cim-7BL overlapped with the seedling stripe rust resistance gene, temporarily designated as YrSuj. Two previously reported pleiotropic adult plant resistance genes, Lr46/Yr29 and Lr67/Yr46, and a new leaf rust resistance quantitative trait loci derived from Avocet were also mapped in the population. The two new co-located resistance loci are expected to contribute to breeding durable rust resistance in wheat. Closely linked molecular markers can be used to transfer all four resistance loci simultaneously to modern wheat varieties.

AB Aegiolops kotschyi cytoplasmic male sterile system often results in part of haploid plants in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To elucidate the origin of haploid, 235 wheat microsatellite (SSR) primers were randomly selected and screened for polymorphism between haploid (2n = 3x = 21 ABD) and its parents, male-sterile line YM21 (2n = 6x = 42 AABBDD) and male fertile restorer YM2 (2n = 6x = 42 AABBDD). About 200 SSR markers yielded clear bands from denatured PAGE, of which 180 markers have identifiable amplification patterns, and 20 markers (around 8%) resulted in different amplification products between the haploid and the restorer, YM2. There were no SSR markers that were found to be distinguishable between the haploid and the male sterile line YM21. In addition, different distribution of HMW-GS between endosperm and seedlings from the same seeds further confirmed that the haploid genomes were inherited from the maternal parent. After haploidization, 1.7% and 0.91% of total sites were up- and down-regulated exceeding twofold in the shoot and the root of haploid, respectively, and most of the differentially expressed loci were up/down-regulated about twofold. Out of the sensitive loci in haploid, 94 loci in the shoot, 72 loci in the root can be classified into three functional subdivisions: biological process, cellular component and molecular function, respectively.

AB Barley leaf rust, caused by Puccinia hordei, is one of the most destructive foliar pathogens of cultivated barley, causing significant yield losses in many regions throughout the world. In this study, 521 seedling-susceptible barley germplasm obtained from diverse breeding material sourced from the Australian Winter Cereals Collection (AWCC), the University of Western Australia (UWA), and international collections from Australia, China, Germany, Spain, and Uruguay were assessed for adult plant resistance (APR) in field nurseries over multiple growing seasons. Lines (213) that consistently showed APR over multiple seasons were screened with PCR-based markers closely linked to Rph20 (bPb0837) and Rph23 (EBmac0603). About 93 % of the lines that were resistant in the field carried one or more uncharacterised APR genes with or without Rph20 and Rph23. There was high variability for APR within specific international germplasm collections. The presence of bPb0837 was strongly correlated with high APR (TR-MR) responses in the field, while lines that were positive for the EBmac0603 allele had intermediate resistance (MRMS). Both EBmac0603 and bPb0837 were present in three German lines (Lenka, Line 17 and Volla) and in the Australian variety Macquarie, all were thus were postulated to carry both Rph20 and Rph23 and had TR-20MR responses in the field. Molecular markers closely linked to Rph20 and Rph23 provide a valuable resource that can be used to assist the incorporation of these genes into new cultivars and identify uncharacterised APR.

AB Background: Wheat (AABBDD, 2n = 6x = 42) is a major dietary component for many populations across the world. Bread-making quality of wheat is mainly determined by glutenin subunits, but it remains challenging to elucidate the composition and variation of low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) genes, the major components for glutenin subunits in hexaploid wheat. This problem, however, can be greatly simplified by characterizing the LMW-GS genes in Triticum urartu, the A-genome donor of hexaploid wheat. In the present study, we exploited the high-throughput molecular marker system, gene cloning, proteomic methods and molecular evolutionary genetic analysis to reveal the composition, variation, expression and evolution of LMW-GS genes in a Triticum urartu population from the Fertile Crescent region.
   Results: Eight LMW-GS genes, including four m-type, one s-type and three i-type, were characterized in the Triticum urartu population. Six or seven genes, the highest number at the Glu-A3 locus, were detected in each accession. Three i-type genes, each containing more than six allelic variants, were tightly linked because of their co-segregation in every accession. Only 2-3 allelic variants were detected for each m-and s-type gene. The m-type gene, TuA3-385, for which homologs were previously characterized only at Glu-D3 locus in common wheat and Aegilops tauschii, was detected at Glu-A3 locus in Triticum urartu. TuA3-460 was the first s-type gene identified at Glu-A3 locus. Proteomic analysis showed 1-4 genes, mainly i-type, expressed in individual accessions. About 62% accessions had three active i-type genes, rather than one or two in common wheat. Southeastern Turkey might be the center of origin and diversity for Triticum urartu due to its abundance of LMW-GS genes/genotypes. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated that the characterized Triticum urartu might be the direct donor of the Glu-A3 locus in common wheat varieties.
   Conclusions: Compared with the Glu-A3 locus in common wheat, a large number of highly diverse LMW-GS genes and active genes were characterized in Triticum urartu, demonstrating that this progenitor might provide valuable genetic resources for LMW-GS genes to improve the quality of common wheat. The phylogenetic analysis provided molecular evidence and confirmed that Triticum urartu was the A-genome donor of hexaploid wheat.

AB In this study, 129 individuals belonging to the Iranian wild diploid Triticum gene pool were screened using PCR-SSCP based on Acc1 and Pgk1 loci. Sequencing of the representatives of different SSCP patterns allowed for detection of three haplotypes for each of the loci. The phylogenetic relationships among the Iranian wild diploid Triticum haplotypes and related genera were analyzed using DNA sequences from these two single copy loci. Despite previous reports that recommended the usefulness of nuclear single copy genes for phylogenetic inference, the Bayesian and parsimony analyses carried out in this study showed that these two loci were not applicable tools in the phylogeny reconstruction of diploid Triticum gene pool. Thus, our findings confirm that phylogenetic relationships among recently diverged species are often difficult to resolve due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in available markers and/or conflict among gene trees.

AB Background: One of the reasons hard red winter wheat cultivar 'Duster' (PI 644016) is widely grown in the southern Great Plains is that it confers a consistently high level of resistance to biotype GP of Hessian fly (Hf). However, little is known about the genetic mechanism underlying Hf resistance in Duster. This study aimed to unravel complex structures of the Hf region on chromosome 1AS in wheat by using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.
   Results: Doubled haploid (DH) lines generated from a cross between two winter wheat cultivars, 'Duster' and 'Billings', were used to identify genes in Duster responsible for effective and consistent resistance to Hf. Segregation in reaction of the 282 DH lines to Hf biotype GP fit a one-gene model. The DH population was genotyped using 2,358 markers developed using the GBS approach. A major QTL, explaining 88% of the total phenotypic variation, was mapped to a chromosome region that spanned 178 cM and contained 205 GBSmarkers plus 1 SSR marker and 1 gene marker, with 0.86 cM per marker in genetic distance. The analyses of GBS marker sequences and further mapping of SSR and gene markers enabled location of the QTL-containing linkage group on the short arm of chromosome 1A. Comparative mapping of the common markers for the gene for QHf. osu-1A(d) in Duster and the Hf-resistance gene for QHf.osu-1A(74) in cultivar '2174' showed that the two Hf resistance genes are located on the same chromosome arm 1AS, only 11.2 cM apart in genetic distance. The gene at QHf. osu-1A(d) in Duster has been delimited within a 2.7 cM region.
   Conclusion: Two distinct resistance genes exist on the short arm of chromosome 1A as found in the two hard red winter cultivars, 2174 and Duster. Whereas the Hf resistance gene in 2174 is likely allelic to one or more of the previously mapped resistance genes (H9, H10, H11, H16, or H17) in wheat, the gene in Duster is novel and confers a more consistent phenotype than 2174 in response to biotype GP infestation in controlled-environment assays.

AB Background: The Poaceae family is of great importance to human beings since it comprises the cereal grasses which are the main sources for human food and animal feed. With the rapid growth of genomic data from Poaceae members, comparative genomics becomes a convinent method to study genetics of diffierent species. The SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats) are widely used markers in the studies of Poaceae for their high abundance and stability.
   Results: In this study, using the genomic sequences of 9 Poaceae species, we detected 11,993,943 SSR loci and developed 6,799,910 SSR primer pairs. The results show that SSRs are distributed on all the genomic elements in grass. Hexamer is the most frequent motif and AT/TA is the most frequent motif in dimer. The abundance of the SSRs has a positive linear relationship with the recombination rate. SSR sequences in the coding regions involve a higher GC content in the Poaceae than that in the other species. SSRs of 70-80 bp in length showed the highest AT/GC base ratio among all of these loci. The result shows the highest polymorphism rate belongs to the SSRs ranged from 30 bp to 40 bp. Using all the SSR primers of Japonica, nineteen universal primers were selected and located on the genome of the grass family. The information of SSR loci, the SSR primers and the tools of mining and analyzing SSR are provided in the PSSRD (Poaceae SSR Database, http://biodb.sdau.edu.cn/pssrd/).
   Conclusions: Our study and the PSSRD database provide a foundation for the comparative study in the Poaceae and it will accelerate the study on markers application, gene mapping and molecular breeding.

AB Background: Several de novo transcriptome assemblers have been developed recently to assemble the short reads generated from the next-generation sequencing platforms and different strategies were employed for assembling transcriptomes of various eukaryotes without genome sequences. Though there are some comparisons among these de novo assembly tools for assembling transcriptomes of different eukaryotic organisms, there is no report about the relationship between assembly strategies and ploidies of the organisms.
   Results: When we de novo assembled transcriptomes of sweet potato (hexaploid), Trametes gallica ( a diploid fungus), Oryza meyeriana (a diploid wild rice), five assemblers, including Edena, Oases, Soaptrans, IDBA-tran and Trinity, were used in different strategies (Single-Assembler Single-Parameter, SASP; Single-Assembler Multiple-Parameters, SAMP; Combined De novo Transcriptome Assembly, CDTA, that is multiple assembler multiple parameter). It was found that CDTA strategy has the best performance compared with other two strategies for assembling transcriptome of the hexaploid sweet potato, whereas SAMP strategy with assembler Oases is better than other strategies for assembling transcriptomes of diploid fungus and the wild rice transcriptomes.
   Conclusion: Based on the results from ours and others, it is suggested that CDTA strategy is better used for transcriptome assembly of polyploidy organisms and SAMP strategy of Oases is outperformed for those diploid organisms without genome sequences.

AB Intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey), a segmental autoallohexaploid (2n = 6x = 42), is not only an important forage crop but also a valuable gene reservoir for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement. Throughout the scientific literature, there continues to be disagreement as to the origin of the different genomes in intermediate wheatgrass. Genotypic data obtained from newly developed EST-SSR primers derived from the putative progenitor diploid species Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Love (St genome), Thinopyrum bessarabicum (Savul. & Rayss) A. Love (J = J(b) = E-b), and Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D. Dewey (E = J(e) = E-e) indicate that the V genome of Dasypyrum (Coss. & Durieu) T. Durand is not one of the three genomes in intermediate wheatgrass. Based on all available information in the literature and findings in this study, the genomic designation of intermediate wheatgrass should be changed to J(vs)J(r)St, where J(vs) and J(r) represent ancestral genomes of present-day J(b) of Th. bessarabicum and J(e) of Th. elongatum, with J(vs) being more ancient. Furthermore, the information suggests that the St genome in intermediate wheatgrass is most similar to the present-day St found in diploid species of Pseudoroegneria from Eurasia.

AB The objective of this work was to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of wheat genotypes, to detect significant and stable genetic associations, as well as to evaluate the efficiency of statistical models to identify chromosome regions responsible for the expression of spike-related traits. Eight important spike characteristics were measured during five growing seasons in Serbia. A set of 30 microsatellite markers positioned near important agronomic loci was used to evaluate genetic diversity, resulting in a total of 349 alleles. The marker-trait associations were analyzed using the general linear and mixed linear models. The results obtained for number of allelic variants per locus (11.5), average polymorphic information content value (0.68), and average gene diversity (0.722) showed that the exceptional level of polymorphism in the genotypes is the main requirement for association studies. The population structure estimated by model-based clustering distributed the genotypes into six subpopulations according to log probability of data. Significant and stable associations were detected on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, and 6D, which explained from 4.7 to 40.7% of total phenotypic variations. The general linear model identified a significantly larger number of marker-trait associations (192) than the mixed linear model (76). The mixed linear model identified nine markers associated to six traits.

AB A total of 158 almond accessions representative of the diversity of almond across the five continents were included for analysis using 17 microsatellite polymorphic markers. Genetic relationships among genotypes were estimated using cluster analysis, allowing their differentiation in two main groups, one with the domesticated almond cultivars and selections and the other with all wild Prunus species close to almond. The unweighted pair group method average tree drawn from this analysis classified the genotypes according to their geographical origin, confirming the particular evolution of different almond ecotypes. Structure analysis showed a strong subpopulation structure and linkage disequilibrium decaying with increasing genetic linkage distance. Analysis of molecular variance confirmed that most of the genetic variability was within populations. Therefore the connection structure between the different populations and the possible bottlenecks in the expansion of almond cultivars could be established.

AB Excessive levels of boron (B) in the subsoil can severely limit crop yields, particularly under dryland conditions where crops often have to depend on rainfall and available water stored in the soil during fallow. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), boron tolerance is controlled by at least two loci located on chromosomes 4AL (Bo4) and 7BL (Bo1). In this study, we sought to determine whether novel genomic regions can be identified in wheat primary synthetic hexaploids (SHWs). The study used data from 333 SHW lines imported into Australia in different shipments between 2003 and 2007. On average, the SHWs were uniformly more tolerant to boron toxicity than the sensitive check, Meering, and the top 5 % showed tolerance levels that were superior (P <= 0.05) to that of Halberd, the most tolerant wheat check cultivar. At a genome-wide significance threshold of -log(P) >= 2.8, association analyses using different algorithms consistently identified three DArT markers, two on chromosome 1AL and one on 4AL. The 4AL region was localised close to the deletion bin location of Bo4, the root-specific boron transporter gene. On the other hand, the two loci on chromosome 1A represent novel regions, which when validated will increase the options of achieving tolerance beyond that conferred by Bo1 and Bo4 alone in breeding programmes.

AB The cereal cyst nematode (CCN, Heterodera avenae Woll.) resistance locus Cre8 on the long arm of chromosome 6B (6BL) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is effective in lowering the nematode population in soil. Identification of reliable and high-throughput molecular markers linked to the Cre8 locus is important for the successful deployment of Cre8-derived resistance in wheat breeding programs. Here, we report the addition of over 600 markers to improve an existing linkage map for the Trident/Molineux wheat population. With the improved map, Cre8 was mapped as a large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) near the distal end of 6BL. This QTL explained up to 35 % of the phenotypic variation in CCN resistance. New marker assays were developed for DNA polymorphisms in the Cre8 region. Seven molecular markers closely linked with Cre8 (at 0.9, 2.2 or 5.9 cM from the estimated QTL position) were found to be diagnostic across a panel of wheat cultivars and are recommended for use in marker-assisted selection of the Cre8 resistance locus in wheat breeding. Prospects for the isolation of the causal gene are discussed.

AB Combinations of effective leaf rust resistance genes that condition resistance to many leaf rust races are key to the development of wheat cultivars with long-lasting resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. A population of F-6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross 'Thatcher*3/Americano 25e' was evaluated for segregation of adult plant leaf rust resistance in three field plot tests and in a greenhouse test. A genetic map was constructed with 243 diversity array technology markers. Significant effects for reduction in leaf rust severity were found on chromosomes 1BL and 5BL. The sequence-tagged site marker csLV46, closely linked to Lr46, mapped to the logarithm of odds peak on chromosome 1BL, indicating that the RILs were likely segregating for this adult plant resistance gene. Lines with csLV46 had an average leaf rust severity of 35 % in the four tests. RILs with the resistance on chromosome 5BL designated as QLr. cdl-5BL had an average leaf rust severity of 47 %. RILs with both csLV46 and QLr. cdl-5BL had an average leaf rust severity of 22 %, close to the Thatcher*2/Americano 25e parental line. Lines that lacked both csLV46 and QLr-5BL had an average severity of 56 %. The QLr. cdl-5BL region enhanced the leaf resistance conditioned by Lr46 in an additive manner.

AB Vitamin A deficiency is a major health problem in many countries around the world. Efforts to alleviate this have included adding supplements to wheat and maize flour. China produces over 70 % of the world production of cucumbers, and any attribute that could increase the beta-carotene content of the fruit has the potential to have a major impact on world health. Cucumbers with yellow flesh contain larger amounts of b-carotene than those with white and green flesh. In this study, yellow fruit flesh cucumber inbred line PI200815 and white fruit flesh inbred line 931 were used as parents to construct a population for genetic analysis of cucumber fruit flesh color. The F-2 segregating population was analyzed by the bulked segregant analysis method and SSR analysis with 2,112 pairs of SSR primers to build a genetic map using JoinMap 4.0 to map the yellow fruit flesh gene. The results showed that the yellow fruit flesh trait of PI200815 was controlled by a single recessive gene, namely yf. A total of 12 SSR primers and five Indel markers were used to build a molecular marker linkage group. The yf gene was mapped to cucumber chromosome 7 (Chr. 7). The closest flanking markers linked to yf were yfSSR108 and yfIndel29 with genetic distances of 0.6 and 0.3 cM, respectively. The physical distance for the region harboring yf was 149.0 kb with 21 predicted candidate genes. The accuracy of marker-assisted selection breeding using the molecular markers, yfSSR108 and yfIndel29, was 92.3 and 84.6 %, respectively.

AB The mode of inheritance of wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr45 was studied at seedling stage under greenhouse conditions against leaf rust race 77-5 in two F-2 populations derived from the crosses between Thatcher (Tc)+Lr45 and two susceptible cultivars Agra Local and NI5439. The genetic analysis in F2: 3 progeny validated the F-2 results which unambiguously showed segregation for a single dominant gene. Genetic analysis in F-2 and BC1F1 generations against five other leaf rust races confirmed the single dominant gene inheritance of Lr45. Mapping was carried out with 92 microsatellite markers specific to chromosome 2A on the F-2 population of the cross Agra Local 9 Tc+Lr45. Out of seven markers linked to the gene, four (gwm372, gwm275, gpw3167 and gwm122) were co-dominant and the other three (cfd168, cfd6 and gwm249) showed dominance, amplifying the allele only in the susceptible parent. The genetic map of 13.1 cM was constructed based on the results in 140 homozygous resistant and homozygous susceptible plants. cfd168 was the closest marker linked to Lr45, followed by gwm372. These markers were validated on the NI5439 9 Tc+Lr45 F2 population, 12 different backcross lines carrying Lr45 and nearisogenic lines, mostly in Tc background isogenic for 46 different Lr genes belonging to both native and alien species. The marker gwm122 was found to be monomorphic. The closest co-dominant marker gwm372 showed reduced polymorphism. Two sequence-based primer pairs, G372(94) and G372(185), were designed and validated. Hence, the markers G372(94) and G372(185) closely linked to the gene can serve as robust co-dominant markers for utilization of Lr45 in wheat improvement.

AB A common wheat landrace, AUS27858, from the Watkins collection showed low seedling stripe rust response against Australian Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes. Genetic analysis of stripe rust resistance indicated the involvement of two independent resistance loci YrAW1 and YrAW2. YrAW1 was mapped in chromosome 4AL and formally named Yr51. Ninety seeds of a heterozygous F-3 line (HSB#5474; YrAW2yrAW2) were grown individually to produce a segregating population referred to as single gene segregating population #5474 (SGSP#5474) to map YrAW2. Monogenic segregation at the YrAW2 locus was confirmed among the SGSP#5474. YrAW2 was located in chromosome 3BS through DArT-based bulked segregant analysis. SGSP#5474 was advanced to F-6 generation and was phenotyped for detailed mapping. Test of allelism with Yr4, previously located on chromosome 3BS, showed 5.2 +/- 1.3 % recombination between YrAW2 and Yr4. Since there is no other stripe rust resistance gene located in the distal part of chromosome 3BS, YrAW2 was formally named Yr57. Markers gwm389 and BS00062676 flanked Yr57 at genetic distances of 2.0 and 2.3 cM, proximally and distally, respectively. These markers were genotyped on a set of Australian and Indian wheat cultivars and the absence of resistance-linked alleles of gwm389 and BS00062676 markers was shown in cultivars known to lack Yr57. These markers would be useful in markerassisted pyramiding of Yr57 with other marker-tagged major and minor genes. The genetic stock carrying Yr57 singly has been deposited with the Australian Winter Cereal Collection, Tamworth, Australia, and it is accessioned as AUS91463.

AB Little seed canary grass (Phalaris minor Retz.) populations resistant to herbicides that inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) represent an increasingly important weed control problem in northern India. The objective of this study was to develop DNA-based markers to differentiate herbicide-resistant and herbicide-susceptible population of P. minor. Primers were designed to amplify the conserved region carrying two reported mutations Trp(2027) to Cys and Ile(2041) to Asn conferring ACCase inhibitor resistance in several grass weeds and subjected to single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to detect the mutations. Five distinctive electrophoretic patterns on non-denaturing PAGE were observed, and four patterns were found to be associated with ACCase herbicide resistance in P. minor. The PCR-SSCP test developed in this study confirmed 17 resistant populations to contain mutations in CT domain of ACCase gene. This is the first report of rapid and easy molecular diagnosis of ACCase herbicide-resistant and herbicide-sensitive population of P. minor through PCR-SSCP analysis.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Seed dormancy is imposed by one or more of the embryo, endosperm, and maternal tissues that belong to two generations and represent two ploidy levels. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for seed dormancy as measured by gross effects on reduced germination rate or delayed germination in crop or model plants. This research developed an endosperm genotype-based genetic approach to determine specific tissues through which a mapped QTL regulates germination using rice as a model. This approach involves testing germination velocity for partially after-ripened seeds harvested from single plants heterozygous for a tested QTL and genotyping endosperms from individual germinated and nongerminated seeds with a codominant DNA marker located on the QTL peak region. Information collected about the QTL includes genotypic frequencies in germinated and/or nongerminated subpopulations; allelic frequency distributions during a germination period; endosperm or embryo genotypic differences in germination velocity; and genotypic frequencies for gametes involved in the double fertilization to form the sampled seeds. Using this approach, the seed dormancy loci SD12, SD1-2, and SD7-1 were determined to regulate germination through the embryo, endosperm, and maternal tissues, respectively; SD12 and SD1-2 acted additively on germination velocity in the offspring tissues; and SD12 also was associated with the preferential fertilization of male gametes in rice. This new genetic approach can be used to characterize mapped genes/QTL for tissue-specific functions in endospermic seeds and for marker-assisted selection of QTL alleles before or immediately after germination in crop breeding.

AB Multiparental populations are innovative tools for fine mapping large numbers of loci. Here we explored the application of a wheat Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population for QTL mapping. This population was created by 12 generations of free recombination among 60 founder lines, following modification of the mating system from strict selfing to strict outcrossing using the ms1b nuclear male sterility gene. Available parents and a subset of 380 SSD lines of the resulting MAGIC population were phenotyped for earliness and genotyped with the 9K i-Select SNP array and additional markers in candidate genes controlling heading date. We demonstrated that 12 generations of strict outcrossing rapidly and drastically reduced linkage disequilibrium to very low levels even at short map distances and also greatly reduced the population structure exhibited among the parents. We developed a Bayesian method, based on allelic frequency, to estimate the contribution of each parent in the evolved population. To detect loci under selection and estimate selective pressure, we also developed a new method comparing shifts in allelic frequency between the initial and the evolved populations due to both selection and genetic drift with expectations under drift only. This evolutionary approach allowed us to identify 26 genomic areas under selection. Using association tests between flowering time and polymorphisms, 6 of these genomic areas appeared to carry flowering time QTL, 1 of which corresponds to Ppd-D1, a major gene involved in the photoperiod sensitivity. Frequency shifts at 4 of 6 areas were consistent with earlier flowering of the evolved population relative to the initial population. The use of this new outcrossing wheat population, mixing numerous initial parental lines through multiple generations of panmixia, is discussed in terms of power to detect genes under selection and association mapping. Furthermore we provide new statistical methods for use in future analyses of multiparental populations.

AB Host resistance is the most economical, effective and ecologically sustainable method of controlling diseases in crop plants. In bread wheat, despite the high number of resistance loci that have been cataloged to date, only few have been cloned, underlying the need for genomics-guided investigations capable of providing a prompt and acute knowledge on the identity of effective resistance genes that can be used in breeding programs. Proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) encoded by the major plant disease resistance (R) genes play an important role in the responses of plants to various pathogens. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of NBS-encoding genes within the whole wheat genome was performed, and the genome scale characterization of this gene family was established. From the recently published wheat genome sequence, we used a data mining and automatic prediction pipeline to identify 580 complete ORF candidate NBS-encoding genes and 1,099 partial-ORF ones. Among complete gene models, 464 were longer than 200 aa, among them 436 had less than 70 % of sequence identity to each other. This gene models set was deeply characterized. (1) First, we have analyzed domain architecture and identified, in addition to typical domain combinations, the presence of particular domains like signal peptides, zinc fingers, kinases, heavy-metal-associated and WRKY DNA-binding domains. (2) Functional and expression annotation via homology searches in protein and transcript databases, based on sufficient criteria, enabled identifying similar proteins for 60 % of the studied gene models and expression evidence for 13 % of them. (3) Shared orthologous groups were defined using NBS-domain proteins of rice and Brachypodium distachyon. (4) Finally, alignment of the 436 NBS-containing gene models to the full set of scaffolds from the IWGSC's wheat chromosome survey sequence enabled high-stringence anchoring to chromosome arms. The distribution of the R genes was found balanced on the three wheat sub-genomes. In contrast, at chromosome scale, 50 % of members of this gene family were localized on 6 of the 21 wheat chromosomes and 22 % of them were localized on homeologous group 7. The results of this study provide a detailed analysis of the largest family of plant disease resistance genes in allohexaploid wheat. Some structural traits reported had not been previously identified and the genome-derived data were confronted with those stored in databases outlining the functional specialization of members of this family. The large reservoir of NBS-type genes presented and discussed will, firstly, form an important framework for marker-assisted improvement of resistance in wheat, and, secondly, open up new perspectives for a better understanding of the evolution dynamics of this gene family in grass species and in polyploid systems.

AB The variation of the vernalization (VRN-1) and photoperiod (PPD-1) genes offers opportunities to adjust heading time and to maximize yield in crop species. The effect of these genes on heading time was studied based on a set of 245 predominantly spring cultivars of bread wheat from the main eco-geographical regions of Europe. The genotypes were screened using previously published diagnostic molecular markers for detecting the dominant or recessive alleles of the major VRN-1 loci such as: VRN-A1, VRN-B1, VRN-D1 as well as PPD-D1. We found that 91% of spring wheat cultivars contain the photoperiod sensitive PPD-D1b allele. Photoperiod insensitive PPD-D1a allele has been found mainly in southern region of Europe. For this region the monogenic control of vernalization by VRN-B1 or VRN-D1 dominant alleles is common, whereas in the remaining part of Europe, the combination of photoperiod sensitive PPD-D1b allele with dominant VRN-A1, VRN-B1 and recessive vrn-D1 alleles represents the most frequent genotype. Also, we revealed a significantly later (5-8 days) heading of the monogenically dominant genotypes at VRN-B1 as compared to the digenic VRN-A1 VRN-B1 genotypes.

AB We report on a new adult plant resistance (APR) gene Rph23 conferring resistance to leaf rust in barley. The gene was identified and characterized from a doubled haploid population derived from an intercross between the Australian barley varieties Yerong (Y) and Franklin (F). Genetic analysis of adult plant field leaf rust scores of the Y/F population collected over three successive years indicated involvement of two highly additive genes controlling APR, one of which was named Rph23. The gene was mapped to chromosome 7HS positioned at a genetic distance 36.6cM. Rph23 is closely linked to marker Ebmac0603, which is flanked by markers bPb-8660 and bPb-9601 with linkage distances of 0.8 and 5.1cM, respectively. A PCR-based marker was optimized for marker-assisted selection of Rph23, and on the basis of this marker, the gene was postulated as being common in Australian and global barley germplasm. Pedigree and molecular marker analyses indicated that the six-rowed black Russian landrace LV-Taganrog' is the likely origin of Rph23.

AB Resistance to Puccinia striiformis in 18 barleys was conferred by one or more genes. In two genotypes, resistance mapped to chromosomes 5HL and 7HL (seedling), and 5HS (adult plant).
   Twenty barley genotypes were assessed for resistance to a variant of P. striiformis [barley grass yellow rust (BGYR)] that is adapted to wild Hordeum sp. (barley grass) and is known to be virulent on several Australian barley cultivars. With the exception of Biosaline-19, all of the genotypes tested were resistant to BGYR. Genetic analyses of 16 Australian and three exotic barley lines indicated that each carried at least a single gene for resistance. Seedling resistance genes identified in the doubled haploid population developed from a cross between Franklin and Yerong were mapped to the long arm of chromosomes 5H and 7H, respectively. These genes were given the temporary designations of Rpsp-hFranklin and Rpsp-hYerong. Three QTL were detected in the same population when tested at the adult plant stage, two of them being in a similar position to Rpsp-hFranklin and Rpsp-hYerong and the third one was mapped to 5HS. Allelism tests between genotypes that exhibited seedling infection type responses to BGYR that were similar to Franklin and Yerong revealed that resistance in most were genetically independent of Rpsp-hFranklin and Rpsp-hYerong.

AB A powdery mildew resistance gene MlHLT derived from a Chinese wheat landrace maps within a 3.6 centimorgan (cM) genetic interval spanning a 13.4 megabase (Mb) physical genomic region on chromosome 1DS.
   Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. Chinese wheat landrace Hulutou confers nearly immune resistance against prevailing Bgt isolate E09 in Beijing. Genetic analysis indicate that the powdery mildew resistance of Hulutou is controlled by a single dominant gene, provisionally designated MlHLT. Bulked segregant analysis(BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that MlHLT is located on chromosome arm 1DS between markers Xgwm337 and Xcfd83/Xcfd72. By applying comparative genomics analysis, collinearity genomic regions of the MlHLT locus on Aegilops tauschii chromosome 1DS were identified in Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 2, rice chromosome 5 and sorghum chromosome 9, respectively. Three new polymorphic markers were developed using the draft genome sequences and the extended single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker sequences of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78, as well as the Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring 454 contig sequences and the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) survey sequences. MlHLT mapped into a 3.6 cM genetic interval spanning 13.4 Mb physical genomic region containing seven contigs (ctg220, ctg4623, ctg1063, ctg5929, ctg3163, ctg699 and ctg1065) on 1DS that has synteny with a 369.8 kb genomic region in Brachypodium, a 380.8 kb genomic region in rice and a 298.4 kb genomic region in sorghum. The genetic and physical maps of MlHLT provide framework for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the powdery mildew resistance gene MlHLT in Hulutou.

AB The genetic diversity among cereals and millets were assessed based on PCR amplification pattern derived from 4 Dof domain and 20 Dof genes specific primers. Multiple bands showing variability in terms of both number and sizes of bands ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 kbp were observed. Out of a total of 906 bands, 894 polymorphic and 12 monomorphic bands were obtained and the percentage of polymorphism ranged from 69.23 to 100 %. A very high degree of polymorphism was observed with all the primers except Dof-24 primer and the genetic diversity ranged from 0.0601 to 0.2118 among these crops. The Jaccard's similarity matrices based dendrogram obtained using UPGMA method revealed two major clusters designated as A and B. The major cluster A comprises of rice, sorghum, maize, finger millet, foxtail millet, barnyard millet and proso millet representing Oryzoideae, Panicoideae, Chloridoideae subfamilies while cluster B with wheat, barley, oat, little millet and kodo millet represents predominantly pooideae subfamily. These major clusters were further bifurcated into two sub-clusters each having members representing almost the same subfamilies.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most widespread and destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Resistance breeding is constantly pursued for decades to tackle the variations of prevalent Pst races. Zhongliang 12 has strong resistance to abiotic stresses, wide adaptability, higher resistance to stripe rust and excellent biological characteristics. To identify the resistance gene(s) against stripe rust, Zhongliang 12 was crossed with stripe rust susceptible genotype Mingxian 169, and F-1, F-2, F-2:3 and BC1 progenies were tested with Chinese Pst race CYR30 and CYR31 in seedling stage in greenhouse. Zhongliang 12 possessed different dominant genes for resistance to each race. Linkage maps were constructed with four simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers, Xwmc695, Xcfd20, Xbarc121 and Xbarc49, for the gene on wheat chromosome 7AL conferring resistance to CYR30 (temporarily designated as Yrzhong12-1) with genetic distance ranging from 3.1 to 10.8cM and four SSR markers, Xpsp3003, Xcfd2129, Xwmc673 and Xwmc51, for the gene on wheat chromosome 1AL conferring resistance to CYR31 (temporarily designated as Yrzhong12-2) with genetic distance ranging from 3.9cM to 9.3cM. The molecular markers closely linked to each gene should be useful in marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes for against stripe rust.

AB BS20-T is a thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) wheat line (Triticum aestivum L.) used in hybrid wheat breeding in northern China. BS20-T was crossed with common wheat variety ZN7. F-1 plants were highly fertile. The segregation ratio of male fertile and male sterile individuals in F-2 and BC1F1 plants were close to 3:1 and 1:1, respectively. Other crosses of BS20-T also segregated for a single gene. Bulked sergeant analysis with SSR markers indicated the sterility gene was located on chromosome 2BL. It was named tmsBS20T. Screening of 162 extremely sterile and 30 extremely fertile F-2 plants with linked markers indicated flanking by gwm403 and gwm374 with genetic distances of 2.2 and 4.5 cM, respectively. tmsBS20T was transferred into several common wheat varieties by using traditional hybridization combined with marker assisted selection with these two markers. Further identification of derived TGMS lines is ongoing.

AB Waterlogging is a major factor limiting barley grain yield worldwide. Climate change will likely increase this water stress in Northern Europe. Breeding for waterlogging tolerance (WLT), as for other abiotic stresses, is difficult, but identification of genetic markers linked to genes affecting WLT could facilitate the breeding process. To identify a suitable marker population, parents of 14 double-haploid (DH) barley populations were tested for segregation of biomass growth reduction in waterlogged soil. The most interesting was found in the offspring from crossing cv. Psaknon and breeding line (SLUdt1398 x Mona(4)). Hence, 120 DH-lines derived from this cross were phenotyped for the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter quantum yield (QY) of electron transport of PSII from leaves of hypoxia-stressed plants and further genotyped with 384-SNP Illumina GoldenGate Bead Array. Five quantitative trait loci (QTL) for QY, with a narrow sense heritability of 0.87, were identified on chromosomes 4, 6 and 7H. They had additive effects ranging from 0.74 to 1.35 % with LOD scores from 3 to 12 and explained variance from 6 to 29 %. The major alleles for high QY were from cv. Psaknon; i.e., QY was low if the alleles from cv. Psaknon were not present. Based on leaf necrosis and residual biomass data, the four most interesting QTL may be also in two other populations with completely different progeny, which shows a certain stability of these QTL. The possibility of using marker assistant selection for WLT is discussed, as is possible concurrent improvement of drought tolerance and grain yield.

AB Aegilops mutica Boiss., a diploid species (2n = 2x = 14, TT), has been rarely studied before. In this research, a hexaploid wheat (cv. Chinese Spring)-Ae. mutica partial amphiploid and a wheat-Ae. mutica addition line were characterized by chromosome karyotyping, FISH using oligonucleotides Oligo-pTa535-1, Oligo-pSc119.2-1, and (GAA) 8 as probes, and EST-based molecular markers. The results showed that the partial amphiploid strain consisted of 20 pairs of wheat chromosomes and 7 pairs of Ae. mutica chromosomes, with both wheat 7B chromosomes missing. EST-based molecular marker data suggested that the wheat-Ae. mutica addition line carries the 7T chromosome. Resistance tests indicated that both the partial amphiploid and the 7T addition line were highly resistant to powdery mildew, whereas the wheat control line Chinese Spring was highly susceptible, indicating the presence of a potentially new powdery mildew resistance gene on the Ae. mutica 7T chromosome. The karyotype, FISH patterns, and molecular markers can now be used to identify Ae. mutica chromatin in a wheat background, and the 7T addition could be used as a new powdery mildew resistance source for wheat breeding.

AB Crop production is significantly limited by waterlogging especially in high rainfall and poorly drained regions in the world. Hence, breeding for waterlogging tolerance to increase production is one of the main objectives of breeders. Similar to other abiotic stress tolerances, the tolerance to waterlogging is a complex trait and difficult to select for in breeding programs. Marker assisted selection has been an effective method for crop improvement by utilizing markers closely related to target traits combined with accurate phenotyping of key factors. In the present study, two bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) F-2:3 populations ('Dogankent' x 'Ducula-4' and 'Ducula-1' x 'Seri-82') derived from susceptible cultivars ('Dogankent' and 'Seri-82') and tolerant ('Ducula-1' and 'Ducula-4') lines were treated with four weeks of waterlogging and screened in two different locations. Additionally, 32 expressed sequence tags and 210 microsatellite markers were screened for analysis of marker trait associations; of which less than %20 (45) of those markers were polymorphic between parents of both populations. Tolerance, yield and quality related traits including plant height index, tillering index, adventitious root formation, heading date, tolerance scoring index, total kernel number and thousand kernel weight were identified to be mostly affected by environment. Marker - trait analyses identified markers significantly associated with waterlogging tolerance as well as yield and quality component traits. In the 'Dogankent' x `Ducula-4' derived population, two markers explaining more than 10% of the total variance for adventitious root formation and thousand kernel weight were detected both on chromosomes 3DL (Xgwm645) and 4AL (Xgwm160). This is one of the first studies revealing markers linked to the tolerance related traits in spring wheat under waterlogging conditions.

AB Perilla frutescens is valuable as a medicinal plant as well as a natural medicine and functional food. However, comparative genomics analyses of P. frutescens are limited due to a lack of gene annotations and characterization. A full-length cDNA library from P. frutescens leaves was constructed to identify functional gene clusters and probable EST-SSR markers via analysis of 1,056 expressed sequence tags. Unigene assembly was performed using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) homology searches and annotated Gene Ontology (GO). A total of 18 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were designed as primer pairs. This study is the first to report comparative genomics and EST-SSR markers from P. frutescens will help gene discovery and provide an important source for functional genomics and molecular genetic research in this interesting medicinal plant.

AB Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging provides spatial and molecular information for a wide range of compounds. This tool can be used to investigate metabolic changes in plant physiology and environmental interactions. A major challenge in our study was to prepare tissue sections that were compatible with high spatial resolution analysis and therefore dedicated sample preparation protocols were established and optimized for the physicochemical properties of all major plant organs. We combined high spatial resolution (5 mu m), in order to detect cellular features, and high mass accuracy (<2 ppm root mean square error), for molecular specificity. Mass spectrometry imaging experiments were performed in positive and negative ion mode. Changes in metabolite patterns during plant development were investigated for germination of oilseed rape. The detailed localization of more than 90 compounds allowed assignment to metabolic processes and indicated possible functions in plant tissues. The 'untargeted' nature of MS imaging allows the detection of marker compounds for the physiological status, as demonstrated for plant-pathogen interactions. Our images show excellent correlation with optical/histological examination. In contrast to previous MS imaging studies of plants, we present a complete workflow that covers multiple species, such as oilseed rape, wheat seed and rice. In addition, different major plant organs and a wide variety of compound classes were analyzed. Thus, our method could be used to develop a plant metabolite atlas as a reference to investigate systemic and local effects of pathogen infection or environmental stress.

AB Rht8 is widely used in dry environments such as Mediterranean regions where it increases plant adaptability. Variation at the Gatersleben wheat microsatellite Xgwm261 locus, whose 192-bp allele closely linked to the dwarfing gene Rht8, on chromosome 2D within 0.6 cM, was used to screen thirty Egyptian bread wheat genotypes released from (1947-2004) to assess the variation at this locus. There were three microsatellite allelic variants based on size. Screening of this wheat collection showed that the three alleles Xgwm261(-165), Xgwm261(-174) and Xgwm261(-192) bp were the most frequent. The highest allele frequency was observed for a Xgwm261(-165) bp fragment (65.52%) followed by a Xgwm261(-174) bp fragment (24.14%). However, the allele frequency of a Xgwm261(-192) bp fragment among these wheat genotypes was 10.34%. The percentage distribution of dwarfing alleles for the microsatellite locus Xgwm261 in the Egyptian wheat breeding programs was 30, 20, 20 and 30% for the wheat breeding program Giza, Sakha, Gemmiza and Sids, respectively. PIC for Xgwm261 was 0.527. Genetic heritage of Egyptian genotypes at the microsatellite locus Xgwm261 is consequence of new parental components usage, carriers short plant and early maturity attributes and consequent selection progeny with these traits in breeding programs. The present study will be helpful in characterization Egyptian wheat genotypes, as well as in accurate selection of parents for wheat breeding program in Egypt.

AB Wheat leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) is one of the most important fungal diseases in China. There are tens of winter wheat cultivars which are approved to be released by the government at a national level and more than 100 wheat cultivars at the provincial level. But there is no information about leaf rust (Lr) genes in these cultivars, which makes it difficult for farmers and breeders to select which cultivars they should plant in their fields and use in their breeding programs. The objective of this paper was to identify the leaf rust resistant genes at seedling stage present in the 84 commercial wheat cultivars from China that have been released in the past few years. A set of 20 near isogenic lines with Thatcher background and 6 lines with known Lr genes were used to test the virulence of 12 races of P. triticina (Pt). By comparing the infection types (ITs) produced on the 84 cultivars by the 12 Pt races with the ITs on the differential sets, the Lr genes were postulated. In addition, 8 molecular markers of Lr genes such as Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr20, Lr21, Lr24, Lr26 and Lr29, which are closely linked to or co-segregated with the Lr gene, were used for further validation of the genes in the 84 Chinese winter wheat cultivars. Twelve Lr genes, including Lr1, Lr3, (Lr3bg), (Lr3ka), Lr11, Lr13, Lr14a, Lr16, Lr26, Lr27, Lr30 and Lr31 were postulated to be present either singly or in combinations in these Chinese wheat cultivars. Lr3 and Lr26 were detected most often in the tested cultivars, with frequencies of 51.2 and 38.1%, respectively. No wheat Lr genes were detected in 16 cultivars, and 4 cultivars may carry unknown Lr genes other than those used in this study. Lr9, Lr20, Lr21, Lr24, Lr25 and Lr29 were not present in any of the 84 tested accessions.

AB With the development of chrysanthemum breeding in recent years, an increasing number of wild species in genera related to Chrysanthemum were introduced to extend the genetic resources and facilitate the genetic improvement of chrysanthemums via hybridization. However, few simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are available for marker-assisted breeding and population genetic studies of chrysanthemum and closely related species. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in public databases and cross-species transferable markers are considered to be a cost-effective means for developing sequence-based markers. In this study, 25 EST-SSRs were successfully developed from Chrysanthemum EST sequences for Chrysanthemum morifolium and closely related species. In total, 4164 unigene sequences were assembled from 7180 ESTs of chrysanthemum in GenBank, which were subsequently used to screen for the presence of microsatellites with the SSRIT software. The screening criteria were 8, 5, 4, and 3 repeating units for di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta- and higher-order nucleotides, respectively. Moreover, 310 SSR loci from 296 sequences were identified, and 198 primer pairs for SSR amplification were designed with the Primer Premier 5.0 software, of which 25 SSR loci showed polymorphic amplification in 52 species and varieties belonging to Chrysanthemum, Ajania, and Opisthopappus. The application of EST-SSR markers to the identification of intergeneric hybrids between Chrysanthemum and Ajania was demonstrated. Therefore, EST-SSRs can be developed for species that lack gene sequences or ESTs by utilizing ESTs of closely related species.

AB The construction of high density genetic linkage map provides a powerful tool to detect and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling agronomically important traits. In this study, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and II lumina 9K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genechip were employed to construct one genetic linkage map of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using 191 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from cross Yu 8679xJing 411. This map included 1 901 SNP loci and 178 SSR loci, covering 1 659.9 cM and 1 000 marker bins, with an average interval distance of 1.66 cM. A, B and D genomes covered 719.1, 703.5 and 237.3 cM, with an average interval distance of 1.66, 1.45 and 2.9 cM, respectively. Notably, the genetic linkage map covered 20 chromosomes, with the exception of chromosome 5D. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 1 754 (92.27%) of 1 901 mapped SNP loci could be aligned to 1 215 distinct wheat unigenes, among which 1 184 (97.4%) were located on one single chromosome, and the rest 31 (2.6%) were located on 2 to 3 chromosomes. By performing in silica comparison, 214 chromosome deletion bin-mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 1 043 Brachypodium genes and 1 033 rice genes were further added onto the genetic linkage map. This map not only integrated genetic and physical maps, SSR and SNP loci, respectively, but also provided the information of Bra chypodium and rice genes corresponding to 1 754 SNP loci. Therefore, it will be a useful tool for comparative genomics analysis, fine mapping of QTL/gene controlling agronomically important traits and marker-assisted selection breeding in wheat.

AB Plant height and fertility are two important traits of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), whose mutants are ideal materials for studies on molecular mechanisms of stem and floral organ development. In this study, we identified a dwarf, multi-pistil and male sterile (dms hereafter) wheat mutant from Zhoumai 18. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker assay with 181 primer pairs showed that only one locus of GWM148-2B was divergent between Zhoumai 18 and dms. There were three typical phenotypes in the progeny of dms, tall (T; ca. 0.8 m), semi-dwarf (M; ca. 0.6 m) and dwarf (D; under 0.3 m) plants. Morphological investigation indicated that the internode length of M was shortened by about 20-50 mm each; the internode number of D was 2 less than that of T and Zhoumai 18, and its internode length was shorter also. The pollen vigor and hybridization test demonstrated that dms mutant was male sterility. Segregated phenotypes in progeny of M suggested that the multi-pistils and sterility were controlled by one recessive gene locus which was designated as dms temporarily, and the plant height was controlled by a semi-dominant gene locus Dms. Therefore, progeny individuals of the dms had three genotypes, DmsDms for tall plants, Dmsdms for semi-dwarf plants and dmsdms for dwarf plants. The mutant progenies were individually selected and propagated for more than 6 generations, thus a set of near isogenic lines of T, M and D for dms were developed. This study provides a set germplasms for studies on molecular mechanisms of wheat stem and spike development.

AB Karyotypes of 3 diploid wheat species containing different variants of the A-genome, Triticum boeoticum (A(b)), T. monococcum (A(b)), and T. urartu (A(u)), were examined using C-banding and FISH with DNA probes representing 5S and 45S rDNA families, the microsatellite sequences GAA(n) and GTT(n), the already known satellite sequences pSc119.2, Spelt52, Fat, pAs1, and pTa535, and a newly identified repeat called Aesp_SAT86. The C-banding patterns of the 3 species in general were similar; differences were observed in chromosomes 4A and 6A. Besides 2 major 45S rDNA loci on chromosomes 1A and 5A, 2 minor polymorphic NORs were observed in the terminal part of 5AL and in the distal part of 6AS in all species. An additional minor locus was found in the distal part of 7A(b)L of T. boeoticum and T. monococcum, but not in T. urartu. Two 5S rDNA loci were observed in 1AS and 5AS. The pTa535 probe displayed species-and chromosome-specific hybridization patterns, allowing complete chromosome identification and species discrimination. The distribution of pTa535 on the A(u)-genome chromosomes was more similar to that on the A-genome chromosomes of T. dicoccoides and T. araraticum, thus confirming the origin of these genomes from T. urartu. The probe pAs1 allowed the identification of 4 chromosomes of T. urartu and 2 of T. boeoticum or T. monococcum. The Aesp_SAT86-derived patterns were polymorphic; main clusters were observed on chromosomes 1A(u) and 3A(u) of T. urartu and chromosomes 3A(b) and 6A(b) of T. boeoticum. Thus, a set of probes, pTa535, pAs1, GAA(n) and GTT(n), pTa71, pTa794, and Aesp_SAT86, proved to be most informative for the analysis of A-genomes in diploid and polyploid wheat species. (C) 2015 S.

AB This study applied newly developed Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and soybean and mungbean DArT libraries for quantitative trait locus (QTL) linkage analysis in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from three soybean crosses that had previously been assessed for physiological response to severe drought stress. The phenotypic assessments had identified statistically significant genetic variation among and within the RIL populations and their parents for three drought-related responses: epidermal conductance (g(e)) and relative water content (RWC) during stress, and plant recovery after stress. The new linkage maps containing only DArT markers for the three populations individually contained 196-409 markers and 15-22 linkage groups (LGs), with an aggregate length ranging from 409.4 to 516.7 cM. An integrated map constructed by using the marker data from all three RIL populations comprised 759 DArT markers, 27 LGs and an expanded length of 762.2 cM. Two populations with the landrace accession G2120 as a parent, CPI 26671 x G2120 (CG) and Valder x G2120 (VG), respectively contained 106 and 34 QTLs. In each of these populations, 10 LGs harboured QTLs associated with RWC, g(e) and recovery ability, of which six similar LGs were associated with drought tolerance. A BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search for sequences of 19 selected DArT markers linked to QTLs conditioning the drought-response traits indicated that 18 DArT markers were unique and aligned to 12 soybean chromosomes. Comparison of these sequenced DArT markers with other markers associated with drought-related QTLs in previously reported studies using other marker types confirmed that five of them overlapped, whereas the remaining 13 were new. Except for chromosome 15, the chromosomes with which the DArT QTLs in the CG and VG populations were associated were those that had been shown to harbour drought-related QTLs in previous studies. A BLASTx protein database search identified soPt-856602 as being associated with the gene for a probable glycosyltransferase At5g03795-like isoform X1 on chromosome 6. Although the several QTLs identified in the study were all of relatively minor effect, it was concluded that, because the DArT technology involves large numbers of markers and enables many lines to be genotyped simultaneously, it should help the process of manipulating multiple QTLs and so enhance their likely cumulative effect.

AB The Chinese wheat line Yu 356-9 exhibits a high level of resistance to leaf rust. In order to decipher the genetic base of resistance in Yu 356-9, gene postulation, inheritance analyses, and chromosome linkage mapping were carried out. Gene postulation completed using 15 leaf rust pathotypes and 36 isogenic lines indicated that Yu 356-9 was resistant to all pathotypes tested. F-1 and F-2 plants from the cross Yu 356-9 (resistant)/Zhengzhou 5389 (susceptible) were tested with leaf rust pathotype "FHNQ" in the greenhouse. Results indicated a 3:1 segregation ratio, indicative of the presence of a single dominant leaf rust resistance gene in Yu 356-9 which was temporarily designated as LrYu. Bulk segregant analysis and molecular marker assays were used to map LrYu. Five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on chromosome 2BS were found closely linked to LrYu. Among these markers, Xwmc770 is the most closely linked, with a genetic distance of 5.7 cM.

AB Plant height (PH) and yield components are important traits for yield improvement in wheat breeding. In this study, 207F(2:4) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Jingdong 8/Aikang 58 were investigated under limited and full irrigation environments at Beijing and Gaoyi, Hebei province, during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 cropping seasons. The RILs were genotyped with 149 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for PH and yield components were analysed by inclusive composite interval mapping. All traits in the experiment showed significant genetic variation and interaction with environments. The range of broad-sense heritabilities of PH, 1000-kernel weight (TKW), number of kernels per spike (KNS), number of spikes per m(2) (NS), and grain yield (GY) were 0.97-0.97, 0.87-0.89, 0.59-0.61, 0.58-0.68, and 0.23-0.48. The numbers of QTLs detected for PH, TKW, KNS, NS, and GY were 3, 10, 8, 7 and 9, respectively, across all eight environments. PH QTLs on chromosomes 4D and 6A, explaining 61.3-80.2% of the phenotypic variation, were stably expressed in all environments. QPH.caas-4D is assumed to be the Rht-D1b locus, whereas QPH.caas-6A is likely to be a newly discovered gene. The allele from Aikang 58 at QPH.caas-4D reduced PH by 11.5-18.2% and TKW by 2.6-3.8%; however, KNS increased (1.2-3.7%) as did NS (2.8-4.1%). The QPH.caas-6A allele from Aikang 58 reduced PH by 8.0-11.5% and TKW by 6.9-8.5%, whereas KNS increased by 1.2-3.6% and NS by 0.9-4.5%. Genotypes carrying both QPH.caas-4D and QPH.caas-6A alleles from Aikang 58 showed reduced PH by 28.6-30.6%, simultaneously reducing TKW (13.8-15.2%) and increasing KNS (3.4-4.9%) and NS (6.5-10%). QTKW.caas-4B and QTKW.caas-5B.1 were stably detected and significantly associated with either KNS or NS. Major KNS QTLs QKNS.caas-4B and QKNS.caas-5B.1 and the GY QTL QGY.caas-3B.2 were detected only in water-limited environments. The major TKW QTKW.caas-6D had no significant effect on either KNS or NS and it could have potential for improving yield.

AB Thinopyrum chromosomes 7el(1), 7el(2), 7E(e), and 7E(i), homoeologous to group 7 chromosomes of common wheat (Triticum aestivum), were determined to have many useful agronomical traits for wheat improvement. To analyze the genetic relationships among the 4 Thinopyrum 7E chromosomes, the conserved orthologous set markers, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and meiotic chromosome pairing were used in this study. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetical averages (UPGMA) analysis indicated that 7el(1), derived from T. ponticum, and 7E(i), derived from T. intermedium, were the most closely related. 7el(2), derived from T. ponticum, was relatively distant from the 7el(1)-7E(i) complex. While 7E(e), derived from T. elongatum, was more distantly related to 7el(1), 7el(2), and 7E(i). This is the first report showing that 7el(1) and 7E(i) may be similar, which could be explained by the similar chromosome signal distribution revealed by GISH as well as UPGMA analysis revealed by both molecular markers and the highest frequency of meiotic pairing. The newly developed genome-specific molecular markers may be useful for marker-assisted selection of Lr19, Bdv3, and Fhblop. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB In the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Zenkoujikomugi', a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 on chromosome 3A (MFT-3A) causes an increase in the level of gene expression, resulting in strong grain dormancy. We used a DNA marker to detect the 'Zenkoujikomugi'-type (Zen-type) SNP and examined the genotype of MFT-3A in Japanese wheat varieties, and we found that 169 of 324 varieties carry the Zen-type SNP. In Japanese commercial varieties, the frequency of the Zen-type SNP was remarkably high in the southern part of Japan, but low in the northern part. To examine the relationship between MFT-3A genotype and grain dormancy, we performed a germination assay in three wheat-growing seasons. On average, the varieties carrying the Zen-type SNP showed stronger grain dormancy than the varieties carrying the non-Zen-type SNP. Among commercial cultivars, 'Iwainodaichi' (Kyushu), 'Junreikomugi' (Kinki-Chugoku-Shikoku), 'Kinuhime' (Kanto-Tokai), 'Nebarigoshi' (Tohoku-Hokuriku), and 'Kitamoe' (Hokkaido) showed the strongest grain dormancy in each geographical group, and all these varieties, except for 'Kitamoe', were found to carry the Zen-type SNP. In recent years, the number of varieties carrying the Zen-type SNP has increased in the Tohoku-Hokuriku region, but not in the Hokkaido region.

AB Starch in wheat is an important component of flour and is related to grain yield and wheat end-products. In this study, a doubled haploid (DH) population with 168 lines derived from a cross of elite Chinese wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars Huapei 3 and Yumai 57 was used to identify dynamic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for total starch content (TSC), amylose (AMS) and amylopectin (AMP) in wheat grain. Traits were measured at stages, grown under three treatments in two seasons, and were assessed by unconditional and conditional QTL analyses. Thirty-three additive QTLs and 21 pairs of epistatic QTLs for TSC, AMS and AMP were detected by unconditional mapping, whereas 19 additive QTLs and 15 pairs of epistatic QTLs were identified by conditional mapping. Of these, QTsc4A.1 and QAms4A.1 were detected continuously at five stages under three treatments in two seasons by unconditional mapping, indicating that the accumulated effects of these QTLs were expressed stably from 12 days after flowering (DAF) and were little affected by nitrogen and water agronomic treatment. These two QTLs also showed net expression from 12 to 22 DAF by conditional mapping. The results indicate that the two loci play an important role in starch synthesis. Most of the epistatic QTLs belonged to a minor QTL, but played an important role in the target traits. Therefore, the development of starch is mainly affected by additive effects besides the epistasis effect. The data are useful for potential marker-assisted selection and cloning of the target gene in further fine mapping, and provide a foundation to understand the genetic mechanism underlying the development of starch in wheat and to increase yield.

AB In order to combine genes for enhancing rust resistance and high yield potential in wheat, parent lines were selected for hybridization on the basis of slow rusting history and phenotypic characters for durable resistance. The hybridized germplasm was advanced in filial generations from F-1 to F-5. Total 750 head rows were planted in F-6 from selected heads among F-5 generation. From 750 single head rows planted in Kaghan, 345 lines were selected on the basis of agronomic traits and rust resistance; two hundred and twenty lines were selected for high yield and rust resistance performance and evaluated for the presence of durable rust resistant genes with molecular markers. It was confirmed that the lines showing durable rust resistance possessed Lr34/Yr18, Lr46/Yr29 and Sr2/Yr30 genes in combination or individuals from these lines. The results indicated that the most prominent lines i.e., V-11211, V-11212, V-11218, V-11227, V-11262, V-11288, V-11296, V-11304, V-11308, V-11319, V-11338, V-11353, V-11365 and V-11396 showed the combination of three designated slow rusting genes. These lines were high yielding with better resistance than all existing approved wheat varieties of the country. None of these lines had complete resistance, but were of slow rusting type and were suitable for commercial cultivation. These results will be useful for wheat breeders and pathologists of the country in planning of future hybridization program. (C) 2015 Friends Science Publishers

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most devastating wheat diseases. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) is a promising source of disease resistance for wheat. A powdery mildew resistance gene conferring resistance to B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate E09, originating from wild emmer wheat, has been transferred into the hexaploid wheat line WE4 through crossing and backcrossing. Genetic analyses indicated that the powdery mildew resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated MIWE4. By mean of comparative genomics and bulked segregant analysis, a genetic linkage map of MIWE4 was constructed, and MIWE4 was mapped on the distal region of chromosome arm 5BL. Comparative genetic linkage maps showed that genes MIWE4, Pm36 and MI3D232 were co-segregated with markers XBD37670 and XBD37680, indicating they are likely the same gene or alleles in the same locus. The co-segregated markers provide a starting point for chromosome landing and map-based cloning of MIWE4, Pm36 and MI3D232.

No. GP-974, PI 672540), were developed at the Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Sichuan Agricultural University of China from the cross 'MY11'/YU25, the latter of which was derived from a cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) and Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey (2n = 6x = 42; JJJ(s)J(s)SS). The four wheat lines have high levels of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) (mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) similar to those of the FHB-resistant genotypes 'Sumai 3' and 'Wangshuibai' based on results of experiments conducted in three different years in three different areas. In addition to FHB resistance, these lines also have strong resistance to both stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici), with infection type (IT) = 0 or 0;, and powdery mildew (caused by Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici), with IT = 0. The results obtained in the Henan Province of China also show that these lines have suitable agronomic and morphological traits. These results indicate that the novel resistant wheat lines L658, L693, L696, and L699 could play an important role in wheat genetic improvement, especially for FHB, stripe rust, and powdery mildew resistance.

AB Iran, as a part of Fertile Crescent, is within the center of diversity and origin of the Triticum L. from Poaceae Barnhart (Gramineae A. L. de Jussieu) family. This study concerns the genetic diversity and inter-relationships analyses of 89 accessions of diploid Triticum (2n = 2x = 14) species including T. monococcum, T. boeoticum subsp. boeoticum, T. boeoticum subsp. thaoudar and T. urartu belong to the einkorn wheat group collected all around Iran using 8 primer pairs of IRAP (Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism). Of 220 DNA fragments analysed from all of accessions, 217 (98.6%) were polymorphic. The genetic distances among taxa and accessions were estimated and dendrograms showing relationship among accessions were generated. The results of this study showed that four taxa of diploid wheat are very similar to each other genetically and there is a high affinity, gene flow and genetic relationships between diploid Triticum accessions, although T. monococcum can be distinct loosely from the two other species including T. boeoticum and T. urartu. The highest average Nei genetic distances were found between T. monococcum and T. urartu (0.14) and the lowest between T. boeoticum subsp. boeoticum and T. boeoticum subsp. thaoudar (0.03). Analyssi of molecular variance (AMOVA) was revealed that 84% of total variation attributed to within population's variability and the remaining 16% variation was ascribed to the differences among species; also it demonstrated a geographical distinction among Triticum accessions. These data proved a center of high diversity in the West and the Northwest of Iran and clearly exposed patterns of two distinct geographic regions.

AB Single-gene mutants tolerant or sensitive to salt stress are ideal materials for identifying and cloning genes related to salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the present study, a salt-sensitive mutant was obtained from the ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced Nipponbare bank. The mutant, designated rice salt sensitive 4 (rss4), showed a significant increase in salt sensitivity at the seedling stage and accumulated high levels of Na+ in shoots, particularly in the blades of old leaves, under conditions of NaCl stress. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for shoot Na+ content was performed using an F-2 population derived from a cross between the rss4 mutant and the indica cultivar Zhaiyeqing 8 (ZYQ8). Three QTLs were identified and one located on the long arm of chromosome 6 was determined to be the candidate locus of the rss4 gene based on comparison and analysis, which explained 40.5% of the phenotypic variance in the shoot Na+ content of the F-2 population. Further analysis of recombination events in 165 mutant individuals of an enlarged mapping population of rss4/ZYQ8 defined the rss4 locus to an interval of 230.5 kb bracketed by markers RM20566 and IM28706 on chromosome 6.

AB Wheat (Triticum spp.) stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn. (Pgt), re-emerged as a devastating disease of wheat because of virulent race Ug99 (TTKSK). Many bread wheat (T. aestivum L.) cultivars grown in North America are susceptible to Ug99 or its derivative races that carry additional virulence. 'Gage' was released in 1963 mainly for its excellent field resistance to leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks) and stem rust. However, Gage's resistance has not been genetically characterized, which would facilitate its use in breeding programs. To better define the nature of the resistance in Gage, we created an F-2 population and the corresponding F-2:3 and F-4:5 families from crosses between Gage and stem rust susceptible cultivar 'Bill Brown'. Inheritance of resistance to Pgt race QFCSC and molecular marker analysis indicated that Sr2 and additional genes explain the stem rust resistance of Gage. Using seedling plant infection types from the F-2, F-2:3, and F-4:5 families, we found that at least one dominant and, most likely, one recessive gene are involved in Gage's resistance. Seedling resistance genes acted independently of Sr2 since Sr2 is effective only at the adult plant stage.

AB Codominant molecular-genetic marker csLV3 was used to examine a collection of bread wheat varieties created in the main plant breeding centers of Ukraine and Russia from 1912 to 2011. Two allelic variants csLV34a and csLV34b associated, respectively, with the absence and presence of gene Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 were revealed. Allele csLV34b, commonly found among varieties of Ukrainian breeding, is especially common in varieties of the Plant Breeding and Genetics Institute (Odessa). The results can be used in breeding programs to select wheat varieties with gene Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 for use in crossing with varieties carrying the race nonspecific genes and develop new varieties with better resistance to fungal diseases.

AB Sugarcane's economic importance is already well established and an appreciation within the research community of its value as a system to aid understanding the complexities of polyploidy is also growing. Over the past decade, sugarcane studies in Australia have identified many markers associated with agronomically important traits. This has been accomplished through the development of genetic maps and large-scale quantitative trait loci (OTL) studies, working towards identifying which genes or regulatory elements underlie these OTL. Over 500 BAC clones were identified by screening the R570 BAC library with gene sequences or DArT markers underlying OTL of interest. The first 72 BAC clones were sequenced to 1982x-41640x coverage using an Illumina HiSeq2000, and a stringent filtering and assembly process using the short read assembler SaSSY produced BAC clones assemblies with a total size of -7.9 Mbp, -0.08% of the R570 genome. These BACs were each assembled into between 1 and 13 contigs which will likely be improved when combined with shotgun sequence information from an R570 mate-pair library (to be sequenced shortly). These BAC sequences, along with our remaining 400 BACs for which sequencing is currently underway, will provide a multi-locus partial genome sequence of the sugarcane clone R570. Illumina sequencing is demonstrated to provide assembly results which are as good as or better than with the 454 platform while also providing a greater throughput. With many great advances in sugarcane genomics on the horizon, sugarcane presents a highly relevant system in which to investigate polyploid genome evolution and the process of diploidisation. New and robust approaches that build on existing knowledge are yet required to fully de-convolute the complexity of sugarcane's ploidy and its impact on genetic and physiological variability.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat. Chinese wheat cultivar Mianmai 41 showed high resistance against most of the prevailing Pst races in China. Genetic analysis of the F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations from a cross between Mianmai 41 and a susceptible line Mingxian 169 indicated that resistance to Pst race CYR32 was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrMY41. Molecular marker analysis placed the gene on chromosome 1B near the centromere. Six co-dominant genomic SSR markers Xwmc329, Xwmc406, Xgwm18, Xgwm131, Xgwm413, and Xbarc312, and one STS marker Xwe173 linked with the resistance gene. The two closest flanking SSR markers were Xgwm18 and Xwmc406, with genetic distances of 2.0 and 4.9 cM, respectively. A seedling test with 29 Pst isolates indicated the reaction patterns of Mianmai 41 were different from those of lines carrying Yr3, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr26, and YrCH42 on chromosome 1B. Allelic tests indicated that YrMY41 is likely a new allele at Yr26 locus.

AB The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA has been used to confirm taxonomic classifications and define phylogenies in several plant species following sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. In this study, co-dominant ITS PCR-RFLP molecular markers were produced in 30 Fagaceae individuals belonging to the Castanea, Fagus and Quercus genera in order to assess the potential of this technique for taxonomic discrimination and determination of phylogenies. The complete ITS region (ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2) was amplified in most of the Fagaceae individuals as a single fragment of similar to 700 bp. The ITS amplified products were digested with nine restriction enzymes, but only four (HaeIII, HpaII, TaqI and Sau96I) produced polymorphic/discriminative patterns. The total expected heterozygosity (HE) was 20.31 % and the gene diversity (I), 32.97 %. The ITS polymorphism was higher within the Quercus genus (85.3 %). The ITS PCR-RFLP markers clustered the Fagaceae species according to genus or infrageneric group (in the case of Quercus sp. individuals). Five oaks did not cluster in line with the adopted infrageneric classification, but three of these were grouped according to their actual ecological distributions. The ITS PCR-RFLP markers indicated their potential for phylogenetic studies since all Fagaceae individuals were discriminated according to genus, and most of the oaks were clustered according to infrageneric group or ecological area.

AB Aluminium toxicity in acid soils is the main limitation to crop production worldwide. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the Al-activated malate transporter (TaALMT1) gene located on chromosome 4DL is associated with malate efflux and Al-tolerance. To introgress Al-tolerance from the breeding line CAR3911 into the high yielding Al-sensitive cultivar Kumpa-INIA, phenotypic and molecular characterizations of gene/QTL underlying Al-tolerance in CAR3911 followed by marker-assisted backcrossing (MAS-BC) were undertaken. Al-tolerant backcross (BC) lines were selected using the functional marker ALMT1-4 designed immediately upstream of the TaALMT1 coding region. Foreground and background selections using ALMT1-4 and microsatellite markers were conducted. Linkage and sequence analyses suggest that the TaALMT1 gene could underly the Al-tolerance in CAR3911, possessing the same promoter type (V) as the Al-tolerant genotypes Carazinho and ET8. The MAS-BC strategy allowed the selection of Al-tolerant lines with the smallest introgressed region (6 cM) on 4D and the highest recurrent parent genome (RPG) (98 %) covering 2 194 cM of the wheat genome. The homozygous BC3F2 line named Kumpa-INIA-TaALMT1 expressed a 3-fold higher Al-tolerance than its isogenic line Kumpa-INIA at 40 mu M Al in the hydroponic solution, and similarly to CAR3911 and Carazinho. The MAS-BC strategy was successful for the introgression of the TaALMT1 gene into Kumpa-INIA in only three BC generations, shortening the breeding cycle to 24 months, which promises to increase wheat production and a greater yield stability in the acid soils of Southern Chile.

AB In shaded wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves, the suppression of blue radiation (BR) triggers senescence. This phenomenon is correlated to an increase in oxidative stress symptoms and a decrease of catalase (CAT) activity, among other traits. Previous data suggest that the radiation signal transduction pathway may involve changes in Ca2+ and H2O2 homeostasis. For better a understanding of the interaction among the spectral composition of radiation, Ca2+ availability, and the antioxidant metabolism in the regulation of shade-induced senescence, detached wheat leaves were placed in a growth chamber and exposed to either blue (B, high BR transmittance) and/or green (G, very low BR transmittance) LeeA (R) filters in the absence or presence of 0.8 mM verapamil (a Ca2+ channels blocker), 4.0 mM EGTA (a Ca(2+)chelator), or 8.0 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (a CAT inhibitor). At defined time points, the leaf samples were analyzed for changes in chlorophyll content, specific activities of CAT, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (POX), CAT isozymes, and gene expression of CAT1, CAT2, and two senescence markers (TaSAG1 and TaSAG3). BR transmittance decreased the chlorophyll degradation rate and SAG genes expression either in leaves continuously exposed under the B filter, as well as in leaves previously exposed under the G filter. The effect of BR was associated with the maintenance of a high CAT (but not APX and POX) activity, and it was suppressed either in the presence of 3-AT or when Ca2+ availability was decreased. BR altered the CAT activity both at the transcriptional and at the posttranscriptional level. Nevertheless, different responses of CAT isozymes and CAT genes expression profiles to specific treatment combinations indicate that they differed in their regulatory pathways.

AB Water chickweed (Myosoton aquaticum L.), a competitive broadleaf weed, is widespread in wheat fields in China. Tribenuron and pyroxsulam failed to control water chickweed in the same field in Qiaotian Village in 2011 and 2012, respectively. An initial tribenuron resistance confirmation test identified a resistant population (AH02). ALS gene sequencing revealed a previously unreported substitution of Glu for Pro at amino acid position 197 in resistant individuals. A purified subpopulation (WRR04) that was individually homozygous for the Pro197Glu substitution was generated and characterized in terms of its response to different classes of ALS inhibitors. A whole-plant experiment showed that the WRRO4 population exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to tribenuron (SU, 318-folds, pyrithiobac sodium (PTB, > 197-fold), pyroxsulam (TP, 81-fold), florasulam (TP, > 36-fold) and imazethapyr (IMI, 11-fold). An in vitro ALS assay confirmed that the ALS from WRRO4 showed high resistance to all the tested ALS inhibitors. These results established that the Pro197Glu substitution endows broad-spectrum resistance across ALS inhibitors in water chickweed. In addition, molecular markers were developed to rapidly identify the Pro197Glu mutation. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new wheat-Thinopyrum translocation line CH13-21 was selected from the progenies derived from a cross between wheat-Th. intermedium partial amphiploid TAI7047 and wheat line Mianyang11. CH13-21 was characterized by using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), multicolor-GISH (mc-GISH), multicolor-fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH) and chromosome-specific molecular markers. When inoculated with stripe rust and powdery mildew isolates, CH13-21 displayed novel resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust which inherited from its Thinopyrum parent. The chromosomal counting analyses indicated that CH13-21 has 42 chromosomes, with normal bivalent pairing at metaphase I of meiosis. GISH probed by Th. intermedium genomic DNA showed that CH13-21 contained a pair of wheat-Th. intermedium translocated chromosomes. Sequential mc-FISH analyses probed by pSc119.2 and pAs1 clearly revealed that chromosome arm 6BS of CH13-21 was replaced by Thinopyrum chromatin in the translocation chromosome. The molecular markers analysis further confirmed that the introduced Th. intermedium chromatin in CH13-21 belonged to the long arm of homoeologous group 6 chromosome. Therefore, CH13-21 was a new T6BS. 6Ai#1L compensating Robertsonian translocation line. It concludes that CH13-21 is a new genetic resource for wheat breeding programs providing novel variation for disease resistances.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Zymoseptoria tritici has been considered one of the important diseases of wheat in Europe and elsewhere including Iran. The most economical strategy to control the disease is the use of genetic resistance. To this aim, this study was conducted to identify new sources of resistance to STB and to investigate the effectiveness of known Stb genes against six Iranian isolates of Z. tritici. Genetic variability analysis using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers revealed high polymorphic banding patterns indicating that a high genetic variability existed among the isolates. Inoculation assays identified 116 isolate-specific resistances among all interactions (n = 420). Of 52 genotypes, 26 wheat genotypes showed no isolate-specific responses and were susceptible to all isolates, which may explain increasing epidemics of Z. tritici occurring in major wheat-growing regions in Iran. Five genotypes were highly resistant to all isolates. Effectiveness determination of Stb genes revealed that Iranian isolates have a broad virulence spectrum against most of the known Stb genes. Among all Stb genes, Stb15 and Stb16/Stb17 in cultivars Arina, Riband and M3 were the most effective resistance genes and conferred resistance to all isolates tested. Hence, these genes should be effective in breeding programs in Iran to control the disease.

AB Wild relatives of wheat possess many agronomic traits important to wheat improvement. Wheat-alien translocation and deletion lines are important genetic stocks in wheat breeding or physical mapping of important alien genes. However, screening for chromosomal structural changes by conventional cytogenetic analyses is time-consuming work. It is necessary to develop an efficient method of finding alien chromosomal structural changes. In this research, two amplicon markers, 6VS-(381) and 6VL-(358), specific to the distal regions of the short and long arms, respectively, of Haynaldia villosa chromosome 6V, were developed based on the expressed sequence tags located on the distal regions of wheat group 6. Marker-assisted screening work was then carried out in two individual radiation-induced populations. The first contained 365 plants involving 43M(1:2) families derived from a pollen irradiation treatment of a wheat-H. villosa monosomic 6V addition line. The other was a M-1 population containing 100 plants derived from an irradiation treatment of a wheat-H. villosa disomic 6V(6A) substitution line. The female parent in both treatments was a common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring. Those plants marked by a single positive distal marker were considered to be putative structural changes of 6V. After cytogenetic analysis, a total of 20 structure-changed chromosomes were identified, comprising 12 whole-arm translocations, four terminal translocations, one 6VL terminal deletion, one translocation deletion, and two intercalary translocations. The double-distal-marker strategy proposed in this study gives an efficient model for finding structural aberrations involving a specific alien chromosome.

AB Protein and starch are important factors in determining wheat end-use quality and yield. However, these two traits are negatively correlated. So in order to dissect the genetic relationship between grain protein content (GPC) and grain starch content (GSC) at QTL/gene level, three mapping populations were used at three locations in 2 years. The QTLs for GPC and GSC were analyzed by unconditional and conditional QTL mappings. Thirteen QTLs were detected for GPC by each of the conditional and unconditional methods of QTL analyses. For GSC, seven and nine QTLs, respectively, were detected using unconditional and conditional QTL analyses methods. Of these QTLs, there was only one major QTL detected for GPC using unconditional QTL analysis. For GSC, two major QTLs were detected through each of the conditional and unconditional QTL mapping methods. Seven QTLs with minor effect on GSC were identified for GPC (Qgpc2A-12, Qgpc6D-3, Qgpc1D-15, Qgpc2D-23, Qgpc2D-31, Qgpc5B-19, and Qgpc4B-7). Four QTLs were found for GSC, named Qgsc1D-1, Qgsc4A-9, Qgsc7B-15, and Qgsc7D1-2, which had minor influence on GPC. The major QTL Qgsc7B-15 can directly be used for improving the GSC in molecular marker-assisted breeding. QTLs detected in the present study could possibly be used in simultaneous improvement of grain protein and starch content in wheat.

AB Pyramiding QTL from multiple sources for FHB resistance presents an opportunity to enhance the FHB resistance of elite wheat germplasm. Mapping FHB resistance QTL directly in wheat breeding populations would eliminate the need for purpose-built mapping populations and thus accelerate marker-assisted pyramiding efforts. In this study, we demonstrate that multiple QTL for FHB resistance can be mapped directly in early-generation breeding populations by application of identical-by-descent (IBD)-based linkage mapping. IBD-based linkage analysis was conducted using 565 segregating F-1 progeny derived from 28 four-way crosses among Fhb1 donor lines and multiple native sources of resistance including Lyman, Overland, Ernie, and Freedom. A total of 15 QTL for FHB resistance were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5A, 6A, 6D, and 7D, including known loci Fhb1, Fhb5, and Rht-B1. QTL conferring native resistance in the cultivars Lyman and Overland are mapped for the first time in this study, including a QTL on chromosome 1AS (Qfhb.sdsu-1A) explaining between 4.5 and 9.9 % of the phenotypic variance in all evaluations. Marker haplotypes for these QTL regions can be used to conduct marker-assisted selection and fixation of resistance alleles in subsequent generations of these breeding populations.

AB Since its identification in the late 1990s, the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis. f. sp. tritici (Pgt)) strain Ug99 (race TTKSK) has represented a worldwide wheat production threat due to its ability to overcome most of the resistance genes present in commercial cultivars. In order to address this challenge, resistance genes in wheat cultivars as well as in wild relatives have been identified. However, stem rust resistance breeding is facing a new challenge with the recent discovery in Ethiopia of a new race of Pgt (TRTTF) capable of defeating Sr13, SrTmp, and Sr1R(Amigo) genes that conferred resistance to the Ug99 race group. As part of an ongoing screening process at USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory, SD4279, an elite line from the hard red spring wheat breeding program at South Dakota State University, was found to be resistant to both races TTKSK and TRTTF. The objectives posed in this research were (1) to characterize the genetics of resistance to stem rust in SD4279 and (2) to identify molecular markers linked to race TTKSK (Ug99) and TRTTF resistance in SD4279. A mapping population composed of 92 F-2:3 families was evaluated for resistance to TTKSK and TRTTF. A single-gene conferring resistance to TTKSK, likely Sr9h, was mapped on chromosome arm 2BL. Also, a single gene was located on chromosome arm 6AS conferring resistance to TRTTF. Based on the type of reaction and map location, we postulate that the 6AS resistance gene is Sr8a which has not been mapped previously using DNA markers.

AB The cellulose synthase-like gene HvCslF6, which is essential for (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan biosynthesis in barley, collocates with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain (1,3; 1,4)-beta-glucan concentration in several populations, including CDC Bold x TR251. Here, an alanine-to-threonine substitution (caused by the only non-synonymous difference between the CDC Bold and TR251 HvCslF6 alleles) was mapped to a position within HvCSLF6 that seems unlikely to affect enzyme stability or function. Consistent with this, transient expression of full-length HvCslF6 cDNAs from CDC Bold and TR251 in Nicotiana benthamiana led to accumulation of similar amounts of (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan accumulation. Monitoring of HvCslF6 transcripts throughout grain development revealed a significant difference late in grain development (more than 30 days after pollination), with TR251 [the parent with higher grain (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan] exhibiting higher transcript levels than CDC Bold. A similar difference was observed between Beka and Logan, the parents of another population in which a QTL had been mapped in the HvCslF6 region. Sequencing of a putative promoter region of HvCslF6 revealed numerous polymorphisms between CDC Bold and TR251, but none between Beka and Logan. While the results of this work indicate that naturally occurring quantitative differences in (1,3; 1,4)-beta-glucan accumulation may be due to cis-regulated differences in HvCslF6 expression, these could not be attributed to any specific DNA sequence polymorphism. Nevertheless, information on HvCslF6 sequence polymorphism was used to develop molecular markers that could be used in barley breeding to select for the desired [low or high (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucan] allele of the QTL.

AB Wheat Q gene located in the homoeologous group 5 chromosomes is extraordinarily important for the widespread cultivation of wheat, because of its effects on many domestication-related morphological traits. The full length of Q gene from each locus of 5A, 5B and 5D is 3.2-3.4 kb, which makes it difficult to verify them from each other by PCR and electrophoresis. This study focused on developing molecular makers to verify the three different wheat Q gene copies from homoeologous chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D. The locus-specific markers based on the INDELs in the 9th intron region of Q gene were designed to verify the three homoeologous loci from each other. Three gene segments of Gene Q were cloned from different wheat materials as molecular markers. These three makers of 536 bp, 665 bp and 578 bp were identified from each homoeologous loci of 5A, 5B and 5D. These markers are useful for tracing different loci of Q gene and can also be used in the identification of genetic materials involved in homoeologous group 5 chromosomes.

AB Wheat anther-specific invertase genes were haplotyped in wheat. Strong allelic selection occurred during wheat polyploidization, domestication and breeding because of their association with yield traits.
   Plant invertase hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Cell wall invertase (CWI), one of the three types of invertase, is essential for plant development. Based on isolated TaCWI genes from chromosomes 4A, 5B and 5D, two SNPs were detected in the promoter region of TaCWI-4A, and four SNPs and two Indels were present in the TaCWI-5D gene. No polymorphism was detected in TaCWI-5B coding or promoter regions. CAPS markers caps4A and caps5D were developed to discriminate haplotypes of TaCWI-4A and TaCWI-5D. Marker/trait association analysis indicated that Hap-5D-C at TaCWI-5D was significantly associated with higher thousand kernel weight (TKW) in 348 Chinese modern cultivars grown in multiple environments. Geographic distributions and changes over time of favored haplotypes showed that Hap-5D-C was the most frequent haplotype in modern cultivars and was strongly positively selected in six major wheat production regions worldwide. However, selection for haplotypes at TaCWI-4A was not so evident, possibly due to balancing effects of the two haplotypes on TKW and grain number per spike (GN). In rainfed production regions, Hap-4A-C was favored because it brought more seeds, but in well irrigated conditions, Hap-4A-T was favored in modern breeding because of higher TKW. Evolutionary analysis among wheat and its relatives showed that genetic diversity of TaCWI genes on chromosomes 4A and 5D declined dramatically in progression from the diploid level to modern polyploid cultivars. There was strong allelic selection during polyploidization, domestication and breeding.

AB Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) plays a critical role not only in photosynthetic carbon metabolism but also in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Although a large number of PGKs have been cloned and purified from a variety of plant sources, their physiological functions in response to abiotic stresses still remain elusive. Here we identified and characterized a member of PGKs gene family, AtPGK2, from Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence analysis showed that AtPGK2 had high sequence similarity to PGKs proteins from other species. By using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and histochemical beta-glucuronidase assays, we demonstrated that AtPGK2 was mainly expressed in germinating seeds and flowers, and it could be induced significantly by salt stress. Through morphological and physiological analyses, we found that over-expression of AtPGK2 conferred salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Furthermore, AtPGK2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced expression of stress-responsive marker genes, including RD29A, RD29B, KIN1 and KIN2. Collectively, our results suggested that over-expression of AtPGK2 in Arabidopsis decreased plant sensitivity to salt stress, and AtPGK2 may play a positive role in salt stress tolerance. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the physiological functions of PGK in response to salt stress in higher plants.

AB Race TTKSK of the wheat stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) threatens the production of wheat and barley worldwide because of its broad-spectrum virulence on many widely grown cultivars. Sources of resistance against race TTKSK were recently identified in several barley landraces (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) and wild barley accessions (H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum). The objectives of this study were to characterize the inheritance of resistance to wheat stem rust race TTKSK in four barley landraces (Hv501, Hv545, Hv602, and Hv612) and two wild barley (WBDC213 and WBDC345) accessions, map the resistance genes, and determine the allelic relationships among the genes in these accessions and the previously described rpg4/Rpg5 locus. Resistant accessions were crossed with the susceptible cv. Steptoe and resulting F-3 populations were evaluated for resistance to race TTKSK at the seedling stage. Segregation of F3 families in populations involving the resistance sources of Hv501, Hv545, Hv612, WBDC213, and WBDC345 fit a 1:2:1 ratio for homozygous resistant (HR)/segregating (SEG)/homozygous susceptible (HS) progenies (with chi(2) = 2.27 to 5.87 and P = 0.053 to 0.321), indicating that a single gene confers resistance to race TTKSK. Segregation of F-3 families in cross Steptoe/Hv602 did not fit a 1:2:1 ratio (HR/SEG/HS of 20:47:43 with chi(2) = 11.95 and P = 0.003), indicating that more than one gene is involved in imparting resistance to race TTKSK. Bulked segregant analysis using >1,500 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers positioned a resistance locus in all six populations on chromosome 5HL in very close proximity to the known location of the rpg4/Rpg5 complex locus. Allelism tests were conducted by making crosses among resistant accessions Hv501, Hv545, and Hv612 and also Q21861 with the rpg4/Rpg5 complex. No segregation was observed in F-2 families inoculated with race TTKSK, demonstrating that all Hv lines carry the same allele for resistance and that it resides at or very near the rpg4/Rpg5 locus. Phenotype evaluations of the six barley accessions with wheat stem rust race QCCJ revealed resistant infection types (ITs) at a low incubation temperature and susceptible ITs at a high incubation temperature, similar to Q21861, which carries the temperature-sensitive gene rpg4. The accessions also exhibited low ITs against the rye stem rust isolate 92-MN-90, suggesting that they also carry Rpg5. This result was confirmed through molecular analysis, which revealed that all six barley accessions contain the serine threonine protein kinase domain that confers Rpg5 resistance. These results indicate that cultivated barley is extremely vulnerable to African stem rust races such as TTKSK because even these diverse selections of landrace and wild barley accessions carry only one locus for resistance.

AB Bacterial leaf streak (BLS; caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. translucens) has become a serious disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the Midwest USA. This study was conducted to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling resistance to BLS in spring wheat using an identity by descent (IBD) mapping approach. The mapping population consisted of 825 individuals representing 60 families. Resistance phenotyping was carried out in greenhouse and field research plots. QTL analysis was performed using both linkage and association-based approaches. Two genomic regions near the simple sequence repeat loci Xwmc522 and Xbarc134, on chromosomes 2A and 6B, respectively, were significantly associated with resistance in both greenhouse and field evaluations. The Xwmc291 and Xbarc3, loci were also significantly associated with greenhouse evaluations of resistance, and Xgwm550 was significantly associated with field observations. Variance explained by the significant markers ranged from 0.56 to 29.56 %, Xwmc522 was most associated with resistance, and narrow-sense heritability for resistance was 0.28. This study demonstrates that the IBD mapping technique is a viable alternative to traditional bi-parental mapping for detecting markers associated with complex traits, like partial disease resistance in breeding populations. This information is potentially useful for marker-assisted selection and should ultimately accelerate development of resistant cultivars.

AB In wheat stems, the levels of fructan-dominated water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) do not always correlate well with grain yield. Field drought experiments were carried out to further explain this lack of correlation. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties, Westonia, Kauz and c. 20 genetically diverse double haploid (DH) lines derived from them were investigated. Substantial genotypic differences in fructan remobilization were found and the 1-FEH w3 gene was shown to be the major contributor in the stem fructan remobilization process based on enzyme activity and gene expression results. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in an auxin response element in the 1-FEH w3 promoter region, therefore we speculated that the mutated Westonia allele might affect gene expression and enzyme activity levels. A cleaved amplified polymorphic (CAP) marker was generated from the SNP. The harvested results showed that the mutated Westonia 1-FEH w3 allele was associated with a higher thousand grain weight (TGW) under drought conditions in 2011 and 2012. These results indicated that higher gene expression of 1-FEH w3 and 1-FEH w3 mediated enzyme activities that favoured stem WSC remobilization to the grains. The CAP marker residing in the 1-FEH w3 promoter region may facilitate wheat breeding by selecting lines with high stem fructan remobilization capacity under terminal drought.

AB Background: The adult plant stem rust resistance gene Sr2 was introgressed into hexaploid wheat cultivar (cv) Marquis from tetraploid emmer wheat cv Yaroslav, to generate stem rust resistant cv Hope in the 1920s. Subsequently, Sr2 has been widely deployed and has provided durable partial resistance to all known races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. This report describes the physical map of the Sr2-carrying region on the short arm of chromosome 3B of cv Hope and compares the Hope haplotype with non-Sr2 wheat cv Chinese Spring.
   Results: Sr2 was located to a region of 867 kb on chromosome 3B in Hope, which corresponded to a region of 567 kb in Chinese Spring. The Hope Sr2 region carried 34 putative genes but only 17 were annotated in the comparable region of Chinese Spring. The two haplotypes differed by extensive DNA sequence polymorphisms between flanking markers as well as by a major insertion/deletion event including ten Germin-Like Protein (GLP) genes in Hope that were absent in Chinese Spring. Haplotype analysis of a limited number of wheat genotypes of interest showed that all wheat genotypes carrying Sr2 possessed the GLP cluster; while, of those lacking Sr2, some, including Marquis, possessed the cluster, while some lacked it. Thus, this region represents a common presence-absence polymorphism in wheat, with presence of the cluster not correlated with presence of Sr2. Comparison of Hope and Marquis GLP genes on 3BS found no polymorphisms in the coding regions of the ten genes but several SNPs in the shared promoter of one divergently transcribed GLP gene pair and a single SNP downstream of the transcribed region of a second GLP.
   Conclusion: Physical mapping and sequence comparison showed major haplotype divergence at the Sr2 locus between Hope and Chinese Spring. Candidate genes within the Sr2 region of Hope are being evaluated for the ability to confer stem rust resistance. Based on the detailed mapping and sequencing of the locus, we predict that Sr2 does not belong to the NB-LRR gene family and is not related to previously cloned, race non-specific rust resistance genes Lr34 and Yr36.

AB Background: Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), encoded by Glu-3 complex loci in hexaploid wheat, play important roles in the processing quality of wheat flour. To date, the molecular characteristics and effects on dough quality of individual Glu-3 alleles and their encoding proteins have been poorly studied. We used a Glu-A3 deletion line of the Chinese Spring (CS-n) wheat variety to conduct the first comprehensive study on the molecular characteristics and functional properties of the LMW-GS allele Glu-A3a.
   Results: The Glu-A3a allele at the Glu-A3 locus in CS and its deletion in CS-n were identified and characterized by proteome and molecular marker methods. The deletion of Glu-A3a had no significant influence on plant morphological and yield traits, but significantly reduced the dough strength and breadmaking quality compared to CS. The complete sequence of the Glu-A3a allele was cloned and characterized, which was found to encode a B-subunit with longer repetitive domains and an increased number of a-helices. The Glu-A3a-encoded B-subunit showed a higher expression level and accumulation rate during grain development. These characteristics of the Glu-A3a allele could contribute to achieving superior gluten quality and demonstrate its potential application to wheat quality improvement. Furthermore, an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) marker for the Glu-A3a allele was developed and validated using different bread wheat cultivars, including near-isogenic lines (NILs) and recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which could be used as an effective molecular marker for gluten quality improvement through marker-assisted selection.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrated that the LMW-GS allele Glu-A3a encodes a specific LMW-i type B-subunit that significantly affects wheat dough strength and breadmaking quality. The Glu-A3a-encoded B-subunit has a long repetitive domain and more a-helix structures as well as a higher expression level and accumulation rate during grain development, which could facilitate the formation of wheat with a stronger dough structure and superior breadmaking quality.

AB Background: The similar to 17 Gb hexaploid bread wheat genome is a high priority and a major technical challenge for genomic studies. In particular, the D sub-genome is relatively lacking in genetic diversity, making it both difficult to map genetically, and a target for introgression of agriculturally useful traits. Elucidating its sequence and structure will therefore facilitate wheat breeding and crop improvement.
   Results: We generated shotgun sequences from each arm of flow-sorted Triticum aestivum chromosome 5D using 454 FLX Titanium technology, giving 1.34x and 1.61x coverage of the short (5DS) and long (5DL) arms of the chromosome respectively. By a combination of sequence similarity and assembly-based methods, similar to 74% of the sequence reads were classified as repetitive elements, and coding sequence models of 1314 (5DS) and 2975 (5DL) genes were generated. The order of conserved genes in syntenic regions of previously sequenced grass genomes were integrated with physical and genetic map positions of 518 wheat markers to establish a virtual gene order for chromosome 5D.
   Conclusions: The virtual gene order revealed a large-scale chromosomal rearrangement in the peri-centromeric region of 5DL, and a concentration of non-syntenic genes in the telomeric region of 5DS. Although our data support the large-scale conservation of Triticeae chromosome structure, they also suggest that some regions are evolving rapidly through frequent gene duplications and translocations.

AB Tibetan semi-wild wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. tibetanum Shao) is a semi-wild hexaploid wheat resource that is only naturally distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Brittle rachis and hard threshing are two important characters of Tibetan semi-wild wheat. A whole-genome linkage map of T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum was constructed using a recombinant inbred line population (Q1028 x ZM9023) with 186 lines, 564 diversity array technology markers, and 117 simple sequence repeat markers. Phenotypic data on brittle rachis and threshability, as two quantitative traits, were evaluated on the basis of the number of average spike rachis fragments per spike and percent threshability in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping performed using inclusive composite interval mapping analysis clearly identified four QTLs for brittle rachis and three QTLs for threshability. However, three loci on 2DS, 2DL, and 5AL showed pleiotropism for brittle rachis and threshability; they respectively explained 5.3%, 18.6%, and 18.6% of phenotypic variation for brittle rachis and 17.4%, 13.2%, and 35.2% of phenotypic variation for threshability. A locus on 3DS showed an independent effect on brittle rachis, which explained 38.7% of the phenotypic variation. The loci on 2DS and 3DS probably represented the effect of Tg and Br1, respectively. The locus on 5AL was in very close proximity to the Q gene, but was different from the predicted q in Tibetan semi-wild wheat. To our knowledge, the locus on 2DL has never been reported in common wheat but was prominent in T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum accession Q1028. It remarkably interacted with the locus on 5AL to affect brittle rachis. Several major loci for brittle rachis and threshability were identified in Tibetan semi-wild wheat, improving the understanding of these two characters and suggesting the occurrence of special evolution in Tibetan semi-wild wheat.

AB Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) results from incompatibility between nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, and is characterized by the inability to produce viable pollen. The restoration of male fertility generally involves the introgression of nuclear genes, termed restorers of fertility (Rf). CMS has been widely used for hybrid seed production in many crops but not in wheat, partly owing to the complex genetics of fertility restoration. In this study, an acrocentric chromosome that restores pollen fertility of CMS wheat in Hordeum chilense cytoplasm (msH1 system) is studied. The results show that this chromosome, of H. chilense origin and named H(ch)ac, originated from a complex reorganization of the short arm of chromosomes 1H(ch) (1H(ch)S) and 6H(ch) (6H(ch)S). Diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers and cytological analysis indicate that H(ch)ac is a kind of 'zebra-like 'chromosome composed of chromosome 1H(ch)S and alternate fragments of interstitial and distal regions of chromosome 6H(ch)S. PCR-based markers together with FISH, GISH, and meiotic pairing analysis support this result. A restorer of fertility gene, named Rf6H(ch)S, has been identified on the short arm of chromosome 6H(ch)S. Moreover, restoration by the addition of chromosome 1H(ch)S has been observed at a very low frequency and under certain environmental conditions. Therefore, the results indicate the presence of two Rf genes on the acrocentric chromosome: Rf6H(ch)S and Rf1H(ch)S, the restoration potential of Rf6H(ch)S being greater. The stable and high restoration of pollen fertility in the msH1 system is therefore the result of the interaction between these two restorer genes.

AB The threat of climate change has instilled a demand for multi-faceted genetic diversity coupled with resourceful tools and technologies to attain biotic and abiotic resistance in crops. The present study was designed to investigate and compare common physiological and morphological traits under normal and water-stressed conditions. Seven selected (Pakistani, Indian and CIMMYT) water stress-tolerant (WST) genotypes were crossed with seven local water stress-susceptible (WSS) lines using a line x tester mating approach. The hybrids, together with parents, were sown in two different environments. Combining ability effects determined the behavior of both parents as well as offspring and allowed the best combiners for different traits to be selected. Different traits showed additive and non-additive types of gene action under both environmental conditions. The present study concluded that genotypes Nesser, Dharwar Dry, Inqilab-91, among others, served as good combiners while Bakhar-2002 x 9247, Dharwar Dry x 9021, Bakhar-2002 x 9244, and Nesser x 9244 are promising cross combinations. Regarding grain yield, genotype 9252 and Dharwar Dry performed best under normal irrigation and water-stressed conditions, respectively. A change in water provision resulted in a shift in gene action, broad sense heritability and proportional share that each trait contributed. When these traits were pooled, it was possible to discriminate between WST and WSS genotypes and, through line x tester experiments, develop drought-and water stress-tolerant lines based on morphological markers under changing climatic conditions.

AB Wheat bread-making quality is mainly determined by glutenin proteins in the grain, which exist in a wide range of variable alleles with differential influence on processing attributes. A recently identified allele, Bx7 over-expression (Bx7(oe)), has been showing highly significant positive effects on wheat dough strength over the normally expressed Bx7 allele. SDS-PAGE and normal RP-HPLC procedures failed to separate the two alleles. In the current study, an extensively optimised MALDI-TOF based procedure and a refined DNA based marker for efficiently differentiating Bx7(oe) from normal Bx7 allele were established. Results indicated that the MALDI-TOF procedure is cost effective, high throughput, and proven reliable, while the refined PCR marker only amplifies Bx7(oe) allele, a clear advantage over the previously developed codominant marker.

AB The examinations of conditions for establishing a variety independent Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure for wheat are preferable since many of cultivars and breeding lines remain recalcitrant for biotechnological manipulation, mainly due to low efficiency of plant regeneration in vitro, which is highly genotype specific. This paper describes and discusses an improved protocol for enhanced and low-genotype dependent Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using a super-binary vector LBA4404/pTOK233 carrying reporter gus-intron gene and hygromycin (hpt) and kanamicyn (nptII) selectable marker genes. The protocol was optimized on highly responsive common wheat cv. Vesna. Transient expression monitored by the gus-intron on explants after 3, 6 and 25 days of co-cultivation, followed by GUS expression and hygromycin resistance in whole plants indicated the protocol including a co-cultivation of freshly isolated immature embryos in the presence of ascorbic acid, and acetosyringone added only in the bacteria-containing infection medium combined with a delayed and stepwise increasing hygromycin B selection procedure significantly enhanced the transformation efficiency in cv. Vesna that exceed 7% of treated explants from previously 0.41%. Explant pre-cultivation did not additionally improve transformation efficiency. The optimized protocol was successful in evoking satisfactory transformation efficiencies from 3.6% to 10.8% in 5 less-responsive wheat genotypes. All 57 T0 hygromycin-resistant and GUS-positive lines were phenotypically normal and fertile. Therefore, the conditions employed in this study may serve as a base to facilitate the transformation in other, particularly recalcitrant wheat cultivars.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating disease of wheat and other small grain cereals. FHB lowers grain yield and quality, and contaminates grain with mycotoxins, predominantly trichotecenes i.e nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON). A survey conducted at three Provinces in Turkey for FHB and 17 isolates were identified as F. graminearum using morphological and molecular markers. A PCR assay was carried out to identify the chemotypes of the isolates. Using Tri13 gene cluster, all 17 isolates that were identified to 15-AcDON type of DON chemotype. None of the isolates displayed 3-ADON or NIV chemotypes. In order to assess variation in aggressiveness among isolates, all isolates were inoculated to a susceptible wheat spikes at field conditions and disease severity and a thousand kernel weight were measured. Aggressiveness (measured as FHB severity or TKW) differed significantly among 17 F. graminearum isolates inoculated onto wheat spikes of FHB susceptible cultivar Gonen (P=0,05). Means of FHB severity ranged from 39.75 to 86.33%, averaging 63.29% in total. Reduction in TKW was also reduced significantly by different isolates. Differences in aggressiveness among isolates may due to genetic recombination, mutation or selection in the surveyed area.

AB Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is one of the major wheat viruses found in the Great Plains of the USA. Cultural practices are the primary methods of disease management, though not fully effective. Although genetic resistance is available, it is temperature sensitive and is sometimes closely linked with traits having negative agronomic effects. Alternative approaches to viral resistance are clearly needed. RNA interference (RNAi) has been shown to play a role in viral defense response and has been successfully used as a biotechnological tool to preprogram viral resistance in transgenic plants. In this work, a portion of the coat protein of WSMV was used as a hairpin construct and was co-transformed with pAHC20-bar to elicit viral resistance. Eleven WSMV RNAi independent transgenic events were obtained. Thirteen T-1 lines were resistant as evident by the lack of viral RNA within the tissue. Beginning in the T-2 generation, single-plant lineages were selected, selfed, and evaluated for resistance and presence of the transgene until the T-5 generation. Families were then evaluated for the presence of the transgene, presence of the selectable marker, and WSMV resistance. Each of the lines in the T-5 generation were resistant to the virus. Generational selection has maintained expression of the transgene and resistance to WSMV.

AB Phosphorus (P) in most diets for sows is poorly digested because pigs do not produce salivary or gastric phytase to hydrolyze P from phytate (inositol hexaphosphate), thus leading to a relatively high amount of P in the manure. An experiment was carried out to study the efficacy of a novel bacterial 6-phytase produced by a strain of Aspergillus oryzae expressing two synthetic genes, both mimicking a phytase gene from a Citrobacter braakii strain. The apparent total tract digestibility coefficient (CATTD) of P, calcium (Ca), crude protein (CP), and gross energy, concentrations of plasma variables, and sow performance were used as response variables. In total, 45 crossbred gestating sows (Large white x Landrace) were individually housed with their litter. Three diets were prepared: (1) positive control (PC; 5.2 g available P/kg), regular sow diet containing inorganic P; (2) negative control (NC; 2.0 g available P/kg) without inorganic P; and (3) NC + 500 FTU/kg diet (NC+PHY). Each diet was fed to 15 sows for 21 days (from day 108 of gestation to day 15 of lactation). To the diets, 3.0 g titanium dioxide/kg was added as a marker to determine CATTD of nutrients. Blood samples were collected from the anterior vena cava at day 1 and 15 of lactation to determine plasma minerals (P, Ca, magnesium, copper, iron, and zinc) and plasma urea, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin. At day 15 of lactation, CATTD of P did not differ between PC and NC. Phytase supplementation to NC increased (P<0.05) CATTD of P from 0.34 to 0.46 compared to NC, but did not affect CATTD of CP, gross energy, and Ca. On day 1 of lactation, plasma P was 0.66 mmol/L lower (P<0.05) in sows fed NC than PC. Phytase supplementation to NC increased (P<0.05) plasma P by 0.40 mmol/L on day 1 but not on day 15 of lactation. Sow performance measured as feed intake and body weight changes did not differ between PC and NC or phytase supplementation to NC. In conclusion, phytase supplementation increased P bioavailability in lactating sows. Feeding a P-reduced diet during the first 2 weeks of lactation did not reduce sow performance.

AB As a result of crossing substituted lines Saratovskaya 29 (S29) 5R(5A) and S29 5R(5D) with line L2075 (T1RS.1BL), two homozygous wheat-rye lines were obtained in the F-7 generation and identified as T5AS.5RL + T1RS.1BL and 5R(5D) + T1RS.1BL, respectively. The rye chromosomes yare of different origins: 5R originated from spring rye Onohoskaya and 1RS from winter rye Saratovskaya 5. A new Robertsonian translocation was obtained where the 5RL arm was translocated to the short arm of wheat chromosome 5A, resulting in the T5AS.5RL translocation chromosome. Two translocations, T5AS.5RL and T1RS.1BL, and one chromosome substitution, 5R(5D), were identified and confirmed to be compensating on the basis of genomic in situ hybridisation, C-banding and 1RS-and 5R-specific PCR markers. Evaluation of resistance to fungal diseases revealed that homozygous T5AS.5RL + T1RS.1BL and 5R(5D) + T1RS.1BL lines are resistant to leaf rust and powdery mildew.

AB Three molecular markering techniques: inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR); start codon targeted (SCoT), conserved DNA-derived polymorphism (CDDP) markers were compared for fingerprinting of 40 varieties of bread wheat. The number of scoreable and polymorphic bands produced using the ISSR, SCoT and CDDP primers for varieties was more than that of genotypes. Average polymorphism information content (PIC) for ISSR, SCoT and CDDP markers was 0.39, 0.41 and 0.34, respectively, and this revealed that three different marker types were equal for the assessment of diversity amongst genotypes. Cluster analysis for three different molecular types revealed that genotypes taken for the analysis can be divided in three and four distinct clusters. There were no significant differences among these markers in terms of the evaluation of genotypes. These results suggest that efficiency of SCoT, CDDP and ISSR markers was relatively the same in fingerprinting of genotypes but SCoT and CDDP analysis are more effective in fingerprinting of wheat genotypes. To our knowledge, this was the first detailed report of a comparison of performance among two targeted DNA region molecular markers (SCoT and CDDP) in comparision with ISSR technique on a set of samples of wheat cultivars. Overall, our results indicate that SCoT, ISSR and CDDP fingerprinting could be used to detect polymorphism for genotypes of wheat.

AB Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) is a valuable source of novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits, resistance to wheat rust, powdery mildew, and insect pests. In this study, we successfully hybridized Ae. sharonensis as the pollen parent to common wheat and obtained backcross derivatives. F1 intergeneric hybrids were verified using morphological observation and cytological and molecular analyses. The phenotypes of the hybrid plants were intermediate between Ae. sharonensis and common wheat. Observations of mitosis in root tip cells and meiosis in pollen mother cells revealed that the F1 hybrids possessed 28 chromosomes. Chromosome pairing at metaphase I of the pollen mother cells in the F1 hybrid plants was low, and the meiotic configuration was 25.94 I + 1.03 II (rod). Two pairs of primers were screened out from 150 simple sequence repeat markers, and primer WMC634 was used to identified the presence of the genome of Ae. sharonensis. Sequencing results showed that the F1 hybrids contained the S-sh genome of Ae. sharonensis. The sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile showed that the alien high molecular weight glutenin subunits of Ae. sharonensis were transferred into the F1 and backcross derivatives. The new wheat- Ae. sharonensis derivatives that we have produced will be valuable for increasing resistance to various diseases of wheat and for improving the quality of bread wheat.

AB Three major quantitative trait loci (QTL) contribute to the durable adult plant stripe rust resistance in the high-quality bread wheat cultivar Kariega; QYr.sgi-2B.1 and QYr.sgi-4A.1, and the pleiotropic resistance gene Lr34/Yr18/Sr57. While marker-assisted selection is currently being used to incorporate the Kariega stripe rust adult plant resistance into new South African wheat breeding lines, effective selection of the large QTL intervals remains a challenging task. In this study, we describe the development of expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived markers as an effective strategy for increasing the marker density in the selected QTL intervals and the conversion of Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and EST-derived markers to sequence tagged site (STS) markers to enable high-throughput screening. To reduce the QTL intervals, a high-resolution mapping population was developed, consisting of 1,020 F-2 individuals, from the cross Kariega x Avocet S. Through recombinant selection, QYr.sgi-2B.1 was shown to reside within a 6.1 cM interval on the short arm of chromosome 2B, between marker loci Xbarc55 and Xwmc344, a reduction from the previous interval size of 23 cM. Previously, QYr.sgi-4A.1 was poorly defined, but by mapping selected recombinants for the QYr.sgi-4A.1 interval, the QTL region was narrowed to a 16.3-cM interval between marker loci Xbarc78, Xwmc313 and Xwmc219 on the long arm of chromosome 4A. An EST-STS marker, Xufs1-4A, was also developed for QYr.sgi-4A.1, which improved selection for this slow-rusting QTL. The EST marker strategy was useful in increasing marker density and contributed to improved selection for the Kariega QTL in resistance breeding. In addition, BC4F2 families were developed to study the expression of QYr.sgi-2B.1 and QYr.sgi-4A.1 individually, and in combination with Lr34/Yr18/Sr57 in the common, stripe rust susceptible background of Avocet S.

AB The recently characterised and mapped adult plant resistance gene Lr67 contributes to the breeding of durable resistance against multiple fungal pathogens of wheat. Lack of tightly linked markers has so far prevented widespread use of Lr67 in breeding programmes. Exhaustive screening of available SSR markers and 9,000 gene-associated SNPs using bulk segregant analysis yielded several linked markers but none close enough to the gene for routine breeding applications. In contrast, genotyping by sequencing identified several better-linked SNP-based markers that were converted into single-marker KASPar assays. Marker csSNP856 co-segregated with Lr67 in two mapping populations and was significantly associated with stripe rust resistance in an association mapping population of 972 wheat lines. High frequency (43 %, 29/66) of the Lr67-associated SNP allele in landraces from the Indian subcontinent suggests the origin of Lr67 from this region. While marker csSNP856 is not diagnostic for the presence of Lr67, it represents a significant step towards assisting the transfer of this adult plant resistance gene into elite germplasm via marker-assisted breeding.

AB Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and barley, and contaminates grains with several trichothecene mycotoxins, causing destructive yield losses and economic impact in the United States. Recently, a F. graminearum strain collected from Minnesota (MN) was determined to produce a novel trichothecene toxin, called NX-2. In order to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of NX-2 producing strains in MN, North Dakota (ND) and South Dakota (SD), a total of 463 F. graminearum strains were collected from three sampling periods, 1999-2000, 2006-2007 and 2011-2013. A PCR-RFLP based diagnostic test was developed and validated for NX-2 producing strains based on polymorphisms in the Tril gene. Trichothecene biosynthesis gene (Tri gene)-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and ten PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were used to genotype all strains. NX-2 strains were detected in each sampling period but with a very low overall frequency (2.8%) and were mainly collected near the borders of MN, ND and SD. Strains with the 3ADON chemotype were relatively infrequent in 1999-2000 (4.5%) but increased to 29.4% in 2006-2007 and 17.2% in 2011-2013. The distribution of 3ADON producing strains also expanded from a few border counties between ND and MN in 1999-2000, southward toward the border between SD and MN in 2006-2007 and westward in 2011-2013. Genetic differentiation between 2006-2007 and 2011-2013 populations (3%) was much lower than that between 1999-2000 and 2006-2007 (22%) or 1999-2000 and 2011-2013 (20%) suggesting that most change to population genetic structure of F. graminearum occurred between 1999-2000 and 2006-2007. This change was associated with the emergence of a new population consisting largely of individuals with a 3ADON chemotype. A Bayesian clustering analysis suggested that NX-2 chemotype strains are part of a previously described Upper Midwestern population. However, these analyses also suggest that the NX-2 isolates could represent a distinct population, but that interpretations of population assignment are influenced by the small number of NX-2 strains available for analysis.

AB Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) increases lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in the rumen, which might translocate into the systemic circulation, triggering a cascade of clinical and immunological alterations. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical immune and metabolic responses to ruminal-derived lipopolysaccharide in nonlactating cows induced with SARA using 2 challenges, a grain-based SARA challenge (GBSC) or an alfalfa-pellet SARA challenge (APSC). Six dry, nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square arrangement of treatments with 4-wk experimental cycles. All cows received the control diet containing 70% forage and 30% mixed concentrates (dry matter basis) for 3 wk. In wk 4, cows received a control diet, GBSC (38% wheat-barley pellets, 32% other mixed concentrate, and 30% forages), or APSC (45% mixed concentrate, 32% alfalfa pellets, and 23% other forages). Total plasma proteins and immunology-related proteins, acute phase proteins, blood cells, serum chemistry, mRNA gene expression of peripheral blood cell surface markers, and selected proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Ruminal pH was lower in both groups with induced SARA compared with a control group. Ruminal endotoxins were higher in GBSC; however, plasma endotoxin was not detected in any study group. No significant differences in feed intake, rectal temperature, white blood cell counts, or differentials were found between control and SARA challenge groups; changes in glucose, urea, Ca, and Mg were observed in SARA groups. Total plasma proteins were lower in both SARA groups, and acute phase proteins were higher in GBSC. The expression of CD14, MD2, and TLR4 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes was not affected by SARA induction. The induction of SARA as a result of GBSC or APSC challenge was successful; however, LPS was not detected in plasma. Changes in clinical, metabolic, and inflammatory responses were not observed in the SARA-challenged cows, suggesting that, in this study, SARA was not associated with a systemic response to inflammation.

AB This study identified 333 genomic regions associated to 28 traits related to nitrogen use efficiency in European winter wheat using genome-wide association in a 214-varieties panel experimented in eight environments.
   Improving nitrogen use efficiency is a key factor to sustainably ensure global production increase. However, while high-throughput screening methods remain at a developmental stage, genetic progress may be mainly driven by marker-assisted selection. The objective of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with nitrogen use efficiency-related traits in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a genome-wide association approach. Two hundred and fourteen European elite varieties were characterised for 28 traits related to nitrogen use efficiency in eight environments in which two different nitrogen fertilisation levels were tested. The genome-wide association study was carried out using 23,603 SNP with a mixed model for taking into account parentage relationships among varieties. We identified 1,010 significantly associated SNP which defined 333 chromosomal regions associated with at least one trait and found colocalisations for 39 % of these chromosomal regions. A method based on linkage disequilibrium to define the associated region was suggested and discussed with reference to false positive rate. Through a network approach, colocalisations were analysed and highlighted the impact of genomic regions controlling nitrogen status at flowering, precocity, and nitrogen utilisation on global agronomic performance. We were able to explain 40 +/- A 10 % of the total genetic variation. Numerous colocalisations with previously published genomic regions were observed with such candidate genes as Ppd-D1, Rht-D1, NADH-Gogat, and GSe. We highlighted selection pressure on yield and nitrogen utilisation discussing allele frequencies in associated regions.

AB Microdochium majus and Microdochium nivale are two of fungal pathogens that cause Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, and have also caused pink snow mold in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. With the aim of assessing levels of genetic variation and population structure, 172 isolates of these Microdochium species obtained from five populations of infected wheat seeds were first classified into each species using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with specific primers. In total 165 (95.9 % of all isolates) and seven isolates (six of Tokachi populations and one of Abashiri populations) were identified as M. majus and M. nivale, respectively, indicating that M. majus was predominant and the main causal pathogen of FHB in this area. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis showed that the total genetic diversity was 0.023 when estimated by Nei's gene diversity index within the five populations dominated by M. majus. An AMOVA analysis also showed that 86.74 % of the total genetic variation was within populations and 13.26 % among populations. These results indicated that little genetic differentiation occurred among the five populations of M. majus. Based on the unweighted pair group method of cluster analysis using the ISSR data, all isolates were identified as one of eight haplotypes in M. majus or six haplotypes in M. nivale, allowing the construction of a dendrogram with two clades corresponding to each species. There was no correlation between the clustering of isolates and their geographic distribution on the tree. These findings show that migration is likely playing an important role in the population biology of M. majus, providing some support for the prediction of epidemics of fungicide resistant strains within populations of the FHB pathogen.

AB In the present study, nitrogen (N) starvation for 8 days significantly inhibited the growth of wheat seedlings as manifested by decreased plant height, shoot fresh weight, and shoot dry weight, although it stimulated root growth. The nitrate and protein contents were markedly reduced and the oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde content, was markedly increased in the leaves and roots of wheat seedlings during N starvation. The genes encoding the NRT1 and NRT2 families in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were identified, and their transcription levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the roots of N-starved wheat seedlings. N starvation significantly enhanced the transcription levels of TaNRT1.1 at 2 and 4 days; TaNRT1.3 at 2, 4, and 6 days; TaNRT1.4 at 2 days; TaNRT1.7 and TaNRT1.8 at 2 days; TaNRT2.1 and TaNRT2.2 at 2 days; and TaNRT2.3 at 2 and 4 days. However, the TaNRT1.5 and TaNRT2.4 genes were greatly inhibited at all sampling time points after N starvation, whereas the TaNRT1.2 and TaNRT2.5 genes were dramatically induced. The functions of these transporters in N starvation of wheat seedlings based on these expression profiles are herein discussed.

AB The allelic variations at glutenin loci could significantly affect the bread baking quality, and specific glutenin alleles might be closely associated with greater gluten strength, which, in turn, is related to superior bread baking quality. In this study, allelic variations at Glu-1, Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci were evaluated in 222 Korean wheat landraces using gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. Ten alleles were identified at Glu-1 loci. Glu-A1c, Glu-B1b, and Glu-D1a or Glu-D1f alleles were predominantly found at the respective loci and their frequencies were 86.5, 87.8 and 96.9 %, respectively. Seven Korean wheat landraces carried the Glu-D1d allele, and only one Korean wheat landrace (IT173162) achieved 10 points for the Glu-1 score. Fifteen alleles were identified at Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci; Glu-A3c and Glu-B3d or Glu-B3i alleles were commonly found at the respective loci and their frequencies were 77.0, 33.3 and 37.8 %, respectively. Glu-B3 alleles exhibited the highest genetic diversity than other alleles, while Glu-B1 and Glu-A1 alleles exhibited the lowest genetic diversity than other alleles. Twenty Korean wheat landraces had the Glu-A3d and Glu-B3b, Glu-B3d, Glu-B3f, Glu-B3g or Glu-B3i alleles, which were correlated with superior bread baking quality. Among these wheat lines, two (IT59787 and IT236544) carried the Glu-D1d allele.

AB Arabidopsis END1-LIKE (AtEND1) was identified as a homolog of the barley endosperm-specific gene END1 and provides a model for the study of this class of genes and their products. The END1 is expressed in the endosperm transfer cells (ETC) of grasses. The ETC are responsible for transfer of nutrients from maternal tissues to the developing endosperm. Identification of several ETC-specific genes encoding lipid transfer proteins (LTP), including the END1, provided excellent markers for identification of ETC during seed development. To understand how AtEND1 forms complexes with lipid molecules, a three-dimensional (3D) molecular model was generated and reconciled with AtEND1 function. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of AtEND1 were examined in transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with an AtEND1 promoter-GUS fusion construct. The AtEND1 promoter was found to be seed and pollen specific. In contrast to ETC-specific expression of homologous genes in wheat and barley, expression of AtEND1 is less specific. It was observed in ovules and a few gametophytic tissues. A series of AtEND1 promoter deletions fused to coding sequence (CDS) of the uidA were transformed in Arabidopsis and the promoter region responsible for AtEND1 expression was identified. A 163 bp fragment of the promoter was found to be sufficient for both spatial and temporal patterns of expression reflecting that of AtEND1. Our data suggest that AtEND1 could be used as a marker gene for gametophytic tissues and developing endosperm. The role of the gene is unclear but it may be involved in fertilization and/or endosperm cellularization.

AB Background: Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat grain leads to a reduction in grain yield and quality. The availability of markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of PHS resistance will serve to enhance breeding selection and advancement of lines for cultivar development. The aim of this study was to identify candidate regions and develop molecular markers for PHS resistance in wheat. This was achieved via high density mapping of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from an Illumina 90 K Infinium Custom Beadchip in a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a RL4452/'AC Domain' cross and subsequent detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PHS related traits (falling number [FN], germination index [GI] and sprouting index [SI]). SNP marker sequences flanking QTL were used to locate colinear regions in Brachypodium and rice, and identify genic markers associated with PHS resistance that can be utilized for MAS in wheat.
   Results: A linkage map spanning 2569.4 cM was constructed with a total of 12,201 SNP, simple sequence repeat (SSR), diversity arrays technology (DArT) and expressed sequence tag (EST) markers. QTL analyses using Multiple Interval Mapping (MIM) identified four QTL for PHS resistance traits on chromosomes 3B, 4A, 7B and 7D. Sequences of SNPs flanking these QTL were subject to a BLASTN search on the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) database (http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository). Best survey sequence hits were subject to a BLASTN search on Gramene (www.gramene.org) against both Brachypodium and rice databases, and candidate genes and regions for PHS resistance were identified. A total of 18 SNP flanking sequences on chromosomes 3B, 4A, 7B and 7D were converted to KASP markers and validated with matching genotype calls of Infinium SNP data.
   Conclusions: Our study identified candidate genes involved in abscissic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) metabolism, and flowering time in four genomic regions of Brachypodium and rice respectively, in addition to 18 KASP markers for PHS resistance in wheat. These markers can be deployed in future genetic studies of PHS resistance and might also be useful in the evaluation of PHS in germplasm and breeding material.

AB Powdery mildew (PM) is a very destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat-Thinopyrum ponticum introgression line CH7086 was shown to possess powdery mildew resistance possibly originating from Th. ponticum. Genomic in situ hybridization and molecular characterization of the alien introgression failed to identify alien chromatin. To study the genetics of resistance, CH7086 was crossed with susceptible genotypes. Segregation in F-2 populations and F-2:3 lines tested with Chinese Bgt race E09 under controlled conditions indicated that CH7086 carries a single dominant gene for powdery mildew resistance. Fourteen SSR and EST-PCR markers linked with the locus were identified. The genetic distances between the locus and the two flanking markers were 1.5 and 3.2 cM, respectively. Based on the locations of the markers by nullisomic-tetrasomic and deletion lines of 'Chinese Spring', the resistance gene was located in deletion bin 2BL-0.89-1.00. Conserved orthologous marker analysis indicated that the genomic region flanking the resistance gene has a high level of collinearity to that of rice chromosome 4 and Brachypodium chromosome 5. Both resistance specificities and tests of allelism suggested the resistance gene in CH7086 was different from previously reported powdery mildew resistance genes on 2BL, and the gene was provisionally designated PmCH86. Molecular analysis of PmCH86 compared with other genes for resistance to Bgt in the 2BL-0.89-1.00 region suggested that PmCH86 may be a new PM resistance gene, and it was therefore designated as Pm51. The closely linked flanking markers could be useful in exploiting this putative wheat-Thinopyrum translocation line for rapid transfer of Pm51 to wheat breeding programs.

AB The genetic architecture of plant height was investigated in a set of 358 recent European winter wheat varieties plus 14 spring wheat varieties based on field data in eight environments. Genotyping of diagnostic markers revealed the Rht-D1b mutant allele in 58% of the investigated varieties, while the Rht-B1b mutant was only present in 7% of the varieties. Rht-D1 was significantly associated with plant height by using a mixed linear model and employing a kinship matrix to correct for population stratification. Further genotyping data included 732 microsatellite markers, resulting in 770 loci, of which 635 markers were placed on the ITMI map plus a set of 7769 mapped SNP markers genotyped with the 90 k iSELECT chip. When Bonferroni correction was applied, a total of 153 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were observed for plant height and the SSR markers (-log(10) (P-value) >= 4.82) and 280 (-log(10) (P-value) >= 5.89) for the SNPs. Linear regression between the most effective markers and the BLUEs for plant height indicated additive effects for the MTAs of different chromosomal regions. Analysis of syntenic regions in the rice genome revealed closely linked rice genes related to gibberellin acid (GA) metabolism and perception, i.e. GA20 and GA2 oxidases orthologous to wheat chromosomes 1A, 2A, 3A, 3B, 5B, 5D and 7B, ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase orthologous to wheat chromosome 7A, ent-kaurene synthase on wheat chromosome 2B, as well as GA-receptors like DELLA genes orthologous to wheat chromosomes 4B, 4D and 7A and genes of the GID family orthologous to chromosomes 2B and 5B. The data indicated that besides the widely used GA-insensitive dwarfing genes Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 there is a wide spectrum of loci available that could be used for modulating plant height in variety development.

AB Leymus mollis (2n = 4x = 28, NsNsXmXm) is an important tetraploid species in Leymus (Poaceae: Triticeae) and a useful genetic resource for wheat breeding because of the stress tolerance and disease resistance of this species. The development of Triticum aestivum (common wheat) - L. mollis derivatives with desirable genes will provide valuable bridge materials for wheat improvement, especially regarding powdery mildew resistance genes, which are rarely documented in L. mollis. In the present study, three derivatives of common wheat cultivar 7182 and L. mollis, namely M47, M51, and M42, were subjected to chromosomal characterization via cytogenetic identification, the analysis of molecular markers, and genomic in situ hybridization. These derivatives were all morphologically and cytogenetically stable. M47 was highly resistant to powdery mildew and nearly immune to stripe rust at the adult stage, and the chromosome constitution of this derivative can be expressed as 2n = 56 = 42T.a + 14L.m (where T.a = T.aestivum chromosomes; L.m = L. mollis chromosomes). Compared to M47, M42 was also resistant to stripe rust but was susceptible to powdery mildew; the chromosome constitution of M42 was 2n = 54 = 42T.a + 12L.m, in which a pair of homoeologous group 7 L. m chromosomes was eliminated. Finally, M51 was susceptible to powdery mildew and stripe rust and had a chromosome constitution of 2n = 48 = 42T.a + 6L.m, in which four pairs of L. m chromosomes from homoeologous groups 2, 4, 5, and 7 were eliminated. The differing disease resistances of the three derivatives are discussed in this report in the context of their chromosomal variations; this information can thus contribute to breeding disease resistant wheat with the potential for applying these derivatives as useful bridge materials.

AB In the tribe Triticeae, several Thinopyrum species have been used as sources of resistance to stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn., abbreviated as Pgt) and other wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) diseases. To identify novel sources of resistance to Pgt race TTKSK (Ug99), we evaluated and characterized the stem rust resistance of 242 accessions belonging to five Thinopyrum species, including beach wheatgrass [Th. bessarabicum (Savul. & Rayss) A. Love], diploid tall wheatgrass [Th. elongatum (Host) D.R. Dewey], intermediate wheatgrass [Th. intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey], sand cough or sea wheatgrass [Th. junceum (L.) A. Love], and decaploid tall wheatgrass [Th. ponticum (Podp.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey]. These accessions were evaluated for seedling reactions to nine Pgt races (TTKSK, TTTTF, TRTTF, RTQQC, QFCSC, TCMJC, TPMKC, TMLKC, and TPPKC), genotyped with molecular markers linked to four stem rust resistance genes (Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, and Sr43) derived from Thinopyrum species, and examined for ploidy levels. All accessions but one (Th. elongatum PI 531718) were resistant to all or most races. Most of the Th. elongatum and Th. ponticum accessions showed near-immunity to all of the races while the accessions of the other three species (Th. bessarabicum, Th. intermedium, and Th. junceum) had varied levels of resistance ranging from near immunity to moderate resistance. Molecular marker analysis showed that most of the markers appeared to be species-or genus-specific rather than linked to a gene of interest, and thus genotyping analysis was of limited value. Comparisons of infection types of accessions based on ploidy level suggested that higher ploidy level was associated with higher levels of stem rust resistance. The results from this study substantiate that the Thinopyrum species are a rich source of stem rust resistance.

AB Branched spike or supernumerary spikelet (SS) is a naturally occurring variant in wheat and holds great potential for increasing the number of grains per spike, and ultimately, increasing wheat yield. However, detailed knowledge of the molecular basis of spike branching in common wheat is lacking. In the present study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross of an SS accession and an elite non-SS line was developed and evaluated over four to six environments for seven SS-related traits to identify the genetic basis of SS in wheat. A framework linkage map was generated using 939 diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers. Composite interval mapping (CIM) identified a total of seven consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) located on five chromosomes (2D, 5B, 6A, 6B, and 7B), suggesting a polygenic inheritance of SS. The phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by individual QTL ranged from 3.3 to 37.3%. The QTL located on 2D (QSS. ndsu-2D) and 7B (QSS. ndsu-7B. 2) have major effects (PVE > 15%), while the remaining five QTL (QSS. ndsu-5B, QSS. ndsu-6A, QSS. ndsu-6B. 1, QSS. ndsu-6B. 2, QSS. ndsu-7B. 1) have minor effects (PVE < 15%). Comparison of the genomic locations of the QTL suggested that QSS. ndsu-2D was located in the same regions on 2DS, where QTL for several traits have been reported. However, the remaining six QTL for SS are reported for the first time. Multiple interval mapping (MIM) showed that all seven QTL are involved in epistatic interaction. The major genomic regions controlling these SS-related traits may prove invaluable for wheat improvement and could also be the target for future studies aimed at cloning these genes.

AB Identification of the chromosomal composition of common wheat lines with rye chromosomes was carried out using genomic in situ hybridization and 1RS- and 5P-specific PCR markers. It was demonstrated that wheat chromosomes 5A or 5D were substituted by rye chromosome 5R in the wheat-rye lines. It was established that one of the lines with complex disease resistance contained rye chromosome 5R and T1RS.1BL, while another line was found to contain, in addition to T1RS.1BL, a new Robertsonian translocation, T5AS.5RL. Substitution of the wheat chromosome 5A with the dominant Vrn-A1 gene for the Onokhoiskaya rye chromosome 5R led to lengthening of the germination-heading period or to a change in the type of development. A negative influence of T1RS.1BL on SDS sedimentation volume and grain hardness was demonstrated, along with a positive effect of the combination of T1RS.1BL and 5R(5D) substitution on grain protein content. Quantitative traits of the 5R(5A) and 5R(5D) substitution lines were at the level of recipient cultivars. A line with two translocations, T1RS.1BL + T5AS.5Rl, appeared to be more productive as compared to the line carrying T1RS.1BL in combination with the 5R(5D) substitution.

AB A comparison was performed with respect to the transcriptional activity of protective protein genes (peroxidase TC 151917, oxalate oxidase AJ 556991.1, and proteinase inhibitor EU 293132.1) in five wheat cultivars (Omskaya 35 and 36, Simbirka, Bashkirskaya 26, and Kazakhstanskaya 10) infected with Septoria nodorum Berk, which causes septoria disease. The intensity of parasite development on leaves was assessed based on the areas of infectious sites in plant tissues. This value was minimal in cultivars Omskaya 35 and 36 and maximal in cultivars Simbirka and Kazakhstanskaya 10; cultivar Bashkirskaya 26 was at an intermediate position. Resistant cultivars had a higher degree of transcriptional activity of genes of anionic peroxidase, oxalate oxidase, and proteinase inhibitor during infection than sensitive cultivars. Our data demonstrate the prospects of using expression levels of the AJ 556991.1, TC 151917, and EU 293132.1 genes as markers for the selection of resistant wheat cultivars.

AB Prediction of wheat phenology facilitates the selection of cultivars with specific adaptations to a particular environment. However, while QTL analysis for heading date can identify major genes controlling phenology, the results are limited to the environments and genotypes tested. Moreover, while ecophysiological models allow accurate predictions in new environments, they may require substantial phenotypic data to parameterize each genotype. Also, the model parameters are rarely related to all underlying genes, and all the possible allelic combinations that could be obtained by breeding cannot be tested with models. In this study, a QTL-based model is proposed to predict heading date in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two parameters of an ecophysiological model (V-sat and P-base, representing genotype vernalization requirements and photoperiod sensitivity, respectively) were optimized for 210 genotypes grown in 10 contrasting location x sowing date combinations. Multiple linear regression models predicting V-sat and P-base with 11 and 12 associated genetic markers accounted for 71 and 68% of the variance of these parameters, respectively. QTL-based V-sat and P-base estimates were able to predict heading date of an independent validation data set (88 genotypes in six location x sowing date combinations) with a root mean square error of prediction of 5 to 8.6 days, explaining 48 to 63% of the variation for heading date. The QTL-based model proposed in this study may be used for agronomic purposes and to assist breeders in suggesting locally adapted ideotypes for wheat phenology.

AB In this investigation we analyzed in detail the consequences of water deficit during the first 4 days of wheat development, focusing on root growth as affected by eventual changes in cell cycle regulation and oxidative processes. Root elongation decreased under water restriction in correlation with the intensity of this limitation, but the total number of cells between the quiescent center and the start of the rapid elongation zone in the root apex did not vary. Neither lipid peroxidation nor protein carbonylation increased in the roots of water-starved seedlings (psi(w): -0.6 MPa); accordingly, catalase activity increased, and transcript levels of cat2 gene were enhanced. Superoxide dismutase activity rose at day 2 and 3 and, unlike catalase, displayed quite similar levels on comparing roots and coleoptiles. Proline and total soluble carbohydrates increased in the roots of water-starved seedling. Total conductivity and osmolality were also augmented. No changes in the transcript levels of the markers related to G1-S transition phase of cell cycle could be detected. However, two expansin genes (TaEXPB8 and TaEXPA5) were up-regulated in roots under water deficit. We conclude that wheat root elongation in water-deprived seedlings was simply hampered by lack of water income to cells. The enhanced expression of two root expansin genes is probably related to the eventual need of a quick cell wall expansion to allow the existing root cells to recover normal turgor, in case of sudden rewatering.
   Maintenance of redox balance, osmotic adjustment and modification of cell wall plasticity may be key points for wheat seedlings to overcome a water restriction during early growth.

AB We report a new stripe rust resistance gene on chromosome 7AS in wheat and molecular markers useful for transferring it to other wheat genotypes.
   Several new races of the stripe rust pathogen have established throughout the wheat growing regions of China in recent years. These new races are virulent to most of the designated seedling resistance genes limiting the resistance sources. It is necessary to identify new genes for diversification and for pyramiding different resistance genes in order to achieve more durable resistance. We report here the identification of a new resistance gene, designated as Yr61, in Chinese wheat cultivar Pindong 34. A mapping population of 208 F-2 plants and 128 derived F-2:3 lines in a cross between Mingxian 169 and Pindong 34 was evaluated for seedling stripe rust response. A genetic map consisting of eight resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), two sequence-tagged site (STS) and four simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was constructed. Yr61 was located on the short arm of chromosome 7A and flanked by RGAP markers Xwgp5467 and Xwgp5765 about 1.9 and 3.9 cM in distance, which were successfully converted into STS markers STS5467 and STS5765b, respectively. The flanking STS markers could be used for marker-assisted selection of Yr61 in breeding programs.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici, syn. Zymoseptoria tritici), is present in most wheat-growing areas worldwide. Resistance breeding appears to be the most sensible approach to disease control. An attempt was made to identify loci associated with resistance to STB in a resistant winter wheat cultivar Liwilla. In the study we used a set of 74 doubled-haploid lines generated from anthers of F-1 hybrids between the resistant cultivar Liwilla and susceptible cultivar Begra. Four monopycnidiospore isolates of M. graminicola with diverse pathogenicity were used in tests on seedlings under controlled growth conditions and on adult plants under polytunnel conditions over a six year period. In both environments, the percentage leaf area covered by necrosis and covered by pycnidia were measured; time to heading and plant height were also recorded for the polytunnel experiments. Seven isolate-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were associated with STB resistance: QStb. ihar-3A. 2, QStb. ihar-6A, QStb. ihar-7A. 2, QStb. ihar-1B, QStb. ihar-2B.2, QStb. ihar-3B, and QStb. ihar-5D. QTL on chromosome 5D and 7A represent novel STB resistance loci. The phenotypic variance explained by individual QTLs ranged from 9.5 % to 50.3 %. Three QTLs detected on chromosomes 3A, 7A and 1B showed major effects and were detected consistently in different environments. The locations of QStb. ihar-3A. 2 and QStb. ihar-1B coincide with the resistance genes Stb6 and Stb11, respectively. Locus QStb. ihar-3B and a QTL for time to heading mapped to the same location, but are most likely not associated. Most of the mapped QTLs explain the resistance associated with both low necrosis and low pycnidia coverage.

AB Identification and mapping new powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes is important for resistance breeding in wheat. Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line X3986-2 was tested against 27 isolates of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. To identify the Pm gene(s) in X3986-2, an F-2 population and its derived F-2:3 lines were developed from a cross between X3986-2 and susceptible line Mingxian169. Segregation ratios indicated the presence of a single dominant Pm locus, tentatively designated PmX39862. Bulked segregant analysis was applied to screen for molecular markers linked to PmX3986-2. Two sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers SCAR112 and SCAR203, and five simple sequence repeat markers CFD40, CFD78, CFD81, GWM293 and WMC443 on chromosome 5D were linked to PmX3986-2, with CFD81 and SCAR112 flanking PmX3986-2 at 0.6 and 1.5 cM, respectively. This suggests that PmX3986-2 may be a novel allele of loci Pm2, Pm46 and PmLX66 on chromosome arm 5DS. PmX3986-2 with its tightly linked DNA markers should be useful for broadening the genetic basis of Pm and rapidly transferring the resistance gene to susceptible cultivars or for us in gene pyramiding for resistance breeding.

AB A fragment of the ScHd1 gene derived from eight inbred lines was sequenced and showed homology to other Hd1 genes from different cereals. Sequences were analysed with respect to the presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference. A C-T transition at position 312 of the consensus sequence was found, which distinguished two lines from the remaining six. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a high identity (93%) to a Hd1-like protein from wheat. The identified mutation allowed the localisation of ScHd1 on a genetic map of rye (6RS). A small, statistically significant linkage between ScHd1 and earliness per se (eps) and some morphological traits was also established. The chromosomal region, including the S76 allele for the ScHd1 gene was linked to earlier heading, elongated spikes, a greater number of spikelets per spike and an increased weight of 1000 kernels.

AB Rust pathogens within the genus Puccinia cause some of the most economically significant diseases of crops. Different formae speciales of P graminis have co-evolved to mainly infect specific grass hosts; however, some genotypes of other closely related cereals can also be infected. This study investigated the inheritance of resistance to three diverse pathotypes of the oat stem rust pathogen (P. graminis f. sp. avenae) in the 'Yerong' x 'Franklin' (Y/F) barley doubled haploid (DH) population, a host with which it is not normally associated. Both parents, 'Yerong' and 'Franklin', were immune to all P. graminis f. sp. aveme pathotypes; however, there was transgressive segregation within the Y/F population, in which infection types (IT) ranged from complete immunity to mesothetic susceptibility, suggesting the presence of heritable resistance. Both QTL and marker-trait association (MTA) analysis was performed on the Y/F population to map resistance loci in response to P. graminis f. sp. avenae. QTL on chromosome 1H ('Yerong' Rpgal and Rpga2) were identified using all forms of analysis, while QTL detected on 511 ('Franklin' Rpga3 and Rpga4) and 7H (Rpga5) were only detected using MTA or composite interval mapping single marker regression analysis respectively. Rpgal to Rpga5 were effective in response to all P. graminis f. sp. avenae pathotypes used in this study, suggesting resistance is not pathotype specific. Rpgal co-located to previously mapped QTL in the Y/F population for adult plant resistance to the barley leaf scald pathogen (Rhynchosporium secalis) on chromosome 1H. Histological evidence suggests that the resistance observed within parental and immune DH lines in the population was prehaustorial and caused by callose deposition within the walls of the mesophyll cells, preventing hyphal penetration.

AB Eighty-two Australian and five exotic barley cultivars were evaluated at the seedling stage for resistance to the Australian stem rust pathotype 98-1,2,3,5,6. Although most of these cultivars exhibited mesothetic (mixed infection type) reactions that were associated with a high level of chlorosis, two ('O'Connor' and 'Pacific Ranger') were highly resistant. Marker analysis indicated that four Australian cultivars ('Empress', 'Vlamingh', Pacific Ranger, and 'Yerong') possess the stem rust resistance gene Rpg1. Tests conducted using North American Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici pathotypes MCCJ and QCCJ supported marker results and indicated that 'Pacific Ranger' and 'Viamingh' likely carry additional stem rust resistance genes. Based on pedigree information and results from multipathotype tests, these genes are believed to be uncharacterized and, therefore, new. The resistance in Australian barley 'Franklin' conferred resistance against all pathotypes tested in this study. Studies of inheritance to MCCJ revealed that it possessed an unknown seedling resistance, which was independent of and displayed additivity to Rpg1.

AB Sitobion avenae is a major agricultural pest of wheat in China. Using microsatellite markers, we studied the potential gene flow, genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure of seven S. avenae populations from different regions of China (Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces). The populations from Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu showed high levels of genic and genotypic diversity. By contrast, the genic diversity in the Beijing and Hebei populations was much lower. Despite this low genic diversity, the genotypic diversity of the Beijing population was higher than that of all of the other populations, except those from Jiangsu and Shandong. Overall, the genetic divergence among the seven S. avenae populations tested was high, though there was almost no differentiation between the Shandong and Henan populations. We observed significant negative correlation between the strength of gene flow and the geographic distances among populations. Based on genetic analysis, the seven S. avenae populations studied can be divided into four distinct clusters; (i) Hubei, (ii) Shanxi, (iii) Beijing and Hebei, and (iv) Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu. The present results provide a basis for potentially optimizing integrated pest management (IPM) programs in China, through adapting control methods that target biological traits shared by various populations of the same genotype.

AB Flowering time is an important trait in wheat breeding as it affects adaptation and yield potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic architecture of flowering time in European winter bread wheat cultivars. To this end a population of 410 winter wheat varieties was evaluated in multi-location field trials and genotyped by a genotyping-by-sequencing approach and candidate gene markers. Our analyses revealed that the photoperiod regulator Ppd-D1 is the major factor affecting flowering time in this germplasm set, explaining 58% of the genotypic variance. Copy number variation at the Ppd-B1 locus was present but explains only 3.2% and thus a comparably small proportion of genotypic variance. By contrast, the plant height loci Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 had no effect on flowering time. The genome-wide scan identified six QTL which each explain only a small proportion of genotypic variance and in addition we identified a number of epistatic QTL, also with small effects. Taken together, our results show that flowering time in European winter bread wheat cultivars is mainly controlled by Ppd-D1 while the fine tuning to local climatic conditions is achieved through Ppd-B1 copy number variation and a larger number of QTL with small effects.

AB We dissected barley chromosomes 1H and 6H added to common wheat by the gametocidal system and identified structural changes of the chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization. We found five aberrations of chromosome 1H, all of which lacked the long arm: one small fragment with the subtelomeric HvT01 sequence, one terminal deletion, and three telocentric chromosomes of the short arm. We established 33 dissection lines carrying single aberrant 6H chromosomes, of which 15 were deletions, 16 were translocations and two were isochromosomes. We conducted PCR analysis of the aberrant barley chromosomes using 75 and 81 EST markers specific to chromosomes 1H and 6H, respectively. This enabled us to construct a cytological map of chromosome 6H and to compare it to the previously reported genetic map and also to the physical map, which were released by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium. The marker orders on the three maps were largely in agreement. The cytological map had better resolution in the proximal region of chromosome 6H than the corresponding genetic map. We discuss some of the discrepancies in marker order between the three maps that might be due to intraspecific polymorphism and gene duplication, as well as to technical problems inherent in the physical mapping process.

AB Varietal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the differences within one of the two subgenomes between different tetraploid cotton varieties and have not been practically used in cotton genetics and breeding because they are difficult to identify due to low genetic diversity and very high sequence identity between homeologous genes in cotton. We have used transcriptome and restriction site2associated DNA sequencing to identify varietal SNPs among 18 G. hirsutum varieties based on the rationale that varietal SNPs can be more confidently called when flanked by subgenome-specific SNPs. Using transcriptome data, we successfully identified 37,413 varietal SNPs and, of these, 22,121 did not have an additional varietal SNP within their 20-bp flanking regions so can be used in most SNP genotyping assays. From restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data, we identified an additional 3090 varietal SNPs between two of the varieties. Of the 1583 successful SNP assays achieved using different genotyping platforms, 1363 were verified. Many of the SNPs behaved as dominant markers because of coamplification from homeologous loci, but the number of SNPs acting as codominant markers increased when one or more subgenome-specific SNP(s) were incorporated in their assay primers, giving them greater utility for breeding applications. A G. hirsutum genetic map with 1244 SNP markers was constructed covering 5557.42 centi-Morgan and used to map qualitative and quantitative traits. This collection of G. hirsutum varietal SNPs complements existing intra-specific SNPs and provides the cotton community with a valuable marker resource applicable to genetic analyses and breeding programs.

AB Crop pathogens evolve rapidly to adapt to their hosts. The use of crops with quantitative disease resistance is expected to alter selection of pathogen life-history traits. This may result in differential adaptation of the pathogen to host cultivars and, sometimes, to the erosion of quantitative resistance. Here, we assessed the level of host adaptation in an oomycete plant pathogenic species. We analysed the phenotypic and genetic variability of 17 Plasmopara viticola isolates collected on Vitis vinifera and 35 isolates from partially resistant varieties (Regent and genotypes carrying the Rpv1 gene). Cross-inoculation experiments assessed two components of aggressiveness and a life-history trait of the pathogen: disease severity, sporangial production and sporangia size. The results contribute evidence to the emergence of P. viticola aggressive isolates presenting a high level of sporulation on the partially resistant Regent. By contrast, no adaptation to the Rpv1 gene was found in this study. The erosion of Regent resistance may have occurred in less than 5 years and at least three times independently in three distant wine-producing areas. Populations from resistant varieties showed a significant increase in sporangia production capacity, indicating an absence of fitness costs for this adaptation. The increase in the number of sporangia was correlated with a reduction in sporangia size, a result which illustrates how partial plant disease resistance can impact selection of the pathogen's life-history traits. This case study on grapevine downy mildew shows how new plant pathogen populations emerge in agro-ecosystems by adapting to partial host resistance. This adaptive pattern highlights the need for wise management of plant partial disease resistance to ensure its sustainability over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a common worldwide pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The use of improved resistant cultivars by the farmers is the most effective and environmentally friendly method to control this aphid in the field. The winter wheat genotypes 98-10-35 and Amigo are resistant to S. avenae. To identify genes responsible for resistance to S. avenae in these genotypes, differential-display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the corresponding differentially expressed sequences in current study. Two backcross progenies were obtained by crossing the two resistant genotypes with the susceptible genotype 1376. Six potential expected-differential bands were sequenced. Lengths of the expressed sequence tags ranged from 128 to 532 bp. Although these expressed sequences were likely associated with S. avenae resistance, there was one expressed sequence tag located on 7DL chromosome, and its potential function may associate with the ability to maintain photosynthesis in wheat. That serves as an active way for tolerant common wheat with resistant to S. avenae. Cloning the full length of these sequences would help us thoroughly understand the mechanism of wheat resistance to S. avenae and be valuable for breeding cultivars with S. avenae resistance.

AB In this study, TaTEF-7A, a member of the transcript elongation factor gene family, and its flanking sequences were isolated. TaTEF-7A was located on chromosome 7A and was flanked by markers Xwmc83 and XP3156.3. Subcellular localization revealed that TaTEF-7A protein was localized in the nucleus. This gene was expressed in all organs, but the highest expression occurred in young spikes and developing seeds. Overexpression of TaTEF-7A in Arabidopsis thaliana produced pleiotropic effects on vegetative and reproductive development that enhanced grain length, silique number, and silique length. No diversity was found in the coding region of TaTEF-7A, but 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms and Indels were detected in the promoter regions of different cultivars. Markers based on sequence variations in the promoter regions (InDel-629 and InDel-604) were developed, and three haplotypes were identified based on those markers. Haplotype-trait association analysis of the Chinese wheat mini core collection revealed that TaTEF-7A was significantly associated with grain number per spike. Phenotyping of near-isogenic lines (NILs) confirmed that TaTEF-7A increases potential grain yield and yield-related traits. Frequency changes in favoured haplotypes gradually increased in cultivars released in China from the 1940s. Geographic distributions of favoured haplotypes were characterized in six major wheat production regions worldwide. The presence of Hap-7A-3, the favoured haplotype, showed a positive correlation with yield in a global set of breeding lines. These results suggest that TaTEF-7A is a functional regulatory factor for grain number per spike and provide a basis for marker-assisted selection.

AB The exploration of genetically superior accessions is the key source of germplasm conservation and potential breeding material for the future. To meet the demand of better yielding chickpea cultivars in Pakistan the present study was organized to select more stable and resistant lines from indigenous as well as exotic chickpea germplasm obtained from Plant Genetic Resource Institute (PGRI), National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad, Pakistan. For the identification and evaluation of chickpea wilt resistant lines against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Schlechtends), the germplasm was tested in the field for the selection of wilt resistant lines and the PCR based molecular markers were investigated to use Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for selection of the desirable cultivars. In field trial, 70 % accessions were resistant to wilt disease, while the remaining 30 % have shown susceptibility to the disease. A total of 5 RAPD and 15 SSR markers were screened for molecular based characterization of wilt response. The data of molecular markers were scored by the presence (1) and absence (0) of allele and subjected to statistical analysis. The analysis was based on coefficient of molecular similarity using UPGMA and sorted the germplasm into two groups based on disease response. Among the total used RAPD/SSR primers, only TA194 SSR marker showed linkage to wilt resistant locus at 85 % probability. The linkage of a marker was reconfirmed by receiver operating characteristic curve. The use of the sorted wilt resistant genotypes through SSR marker TA194 can make available ample prospect in MAS breeding for yield improvement of the crop in Pakistan.

AB We characterized a wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica derived line 3-6-4-1 based on genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), molecular marker analysis, and agronomic trait evaluations. The GISH investigations showed that the 3-6-4-1 contained 42 wheat chromosomes and a pair of P. huashanica chromosomes. The homoeologous relationships of the introduced P. huashanica chromosomes were determined using EST-STS multiple loci markers from seven wheat homoeologous groups in the parents and the addition line. Twelve EST-STS markers located on the homoeologous group 2 chromosomes of wheat amplified polymorphic bands in 3-6-4-1, which were unique to P. huashanica. An introduced Ns chromosome pair that belonged to homoeologous group 2 was identified using chromosome-specific markers. Inoculation with isolates of the stripe rust pathotypes, CYR31, CYR32, and SY11-14, and mixed races (CYR31, CYR32, and SY11-14) in the seeding and adult stage, respectively, showed that 3-6-4-1 was generally resistant to stripe rust, which was probably attributable to its P. huashanica parent. We also compared a complete set of wheat-P. huashanica disomic addition lines (1Ns-7Ns, 2n = 44 = 22II) to assess their agronomic traits and morphological characteristics, which showed that 3-6-4-1 had improved spike traits compared with its parents. The P. huashanica 2Ns chromosome-specific molecular markers in 3-6-4-1 could be useful for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs to combat stripe rust. This line can be used as a donor source to introduce novel excellent genes from P. huashanica into wheat to widen its genetic diversity, thereby providing new germplasms for wheat breeding.

AB This study identified three QTL conferring resistance to Oculimacula acuformis in Aegilops longissima and their associated markers, which can be useful in marker-assisted selection breeding for eyespot resistance.
   Oculimacula acuformis is one of two species of soilborne fungi that cause eyespot of wheat, the other being Oculimacula yallundae. Both pathogens can coexist in the same field and produce elliptical lesions on stem bases of wheat that are indistinguishable. Pch1 and Pch2 are the only two eyespot resistance genes readily available to wheat breeders, but neither provides complete control. A new source of eyespot resistance was identified from Aegilops longissima (2n = 14, (SSl)-S-l), a wild relative of wheat. Three QTL for resistance to O. acuformis were mapped in chromosomes 1S(l), 3S(l), and 5S(l) using a recombinant inbred line population developed from the cross Ae. longissima accessions PI 542196 (R) x PI 330486 (S). The three QTL explained 66 % of phenotypic variation by beta-glucuronidase score (GUS) and 84 % by visual rating. These QTL had LOD values of 10.6, 8.8, and 6.0 for GUS score, and 16.0, 10.0, and 13.0 for visual rating. QTL associated with resistance to O. acuformis have similar chromosomal locations as some for resistance to O. yallundae, except that a QTL for resistance to O. yallundae was found in chromosome 7S(l) but not for O. acuformis. Thus, it appears that some genes at the same locus in Ae. longissima may control resistance to both eyespot pathogens. QTL effective against both pathogens will be most useful for breeding programs and have potential to improve the effectiveness and genetic diversity of eyespot resistance.

AB Identification and allele-specific marker development of a functional SNP of HvLox - 1 which associated with barley lipoxygenase activity.
   Improving the stability of the flavor of beer is one of the main objectives in breeding barley for malting, and lipoxygenase-1 (LOX-1) is a key enzyme controlling this trait. In this study, a modified LOX activity assay was used for null LOX-1 mutant screening. Four barley landraces with no detected level of LOX-1 activity were screened from 1,083 barley germplasm accessions from China. The genomic sequence diversity of the HvLox-1 gene of the four null LOX-1 Chinese landraces was compared with that of a further 76 accessions. A total of 104 nucleotide polymorphisms were found, which contained 83 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 7 multiple-nucleotide polymorphisms, and 14 insertions and deletions. Most notably, we found a rare C/G mutation (SNP-61) in the second intron which led to null LOX-1 activity through an altered splicing acceptor site. In addition, an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction marker was developed for the genotyping of SNP-61, which could be used in breeding programs for barley to be used for malting. The objective was to improve beer quality.

AB Growing resistant wheat varieties is a key method of controlling two important wheat diseases, leaf rust and stripe rust. We analyzed quantitative trait loci (QTL) to investigate adult plant resistance (APR) to these rusts, using 141 F-5 RILs derived from the cross 'Avocet-YrA/Francolin#1'. Phenotyping of leaf rust resistance was conducted during two seasons at Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, whereas stripe rust was evaluated for two seasons in Toluca, Mexico, and one season in Chengdu, China. The genetic map was constructed with 581 markers, including diversity arrays technology and simple sequence repeat. Significant loci for reducing leaf rust severity were designated QLr.cim-1BL, QLr.cim-3BS.1, QLr.cim-3DC, and QLr.cim-7DS. The six QTL that reduced stripe rust severity were designated QYr.cim-1BL, QYr.cim-2BS, QYr.cim-2DS, QYr.cim-3BS.2, QYr.cim-5AL, and QYr.cim-6AL. All loci were conferred by Francolin#1, with the exception of QYr.cim-2DS, QYr.cim-5AL, and QYr.cim-6AL, which were derived from Avocet-YrA. Closely linked markers indicated that the 1BL locus was the pleiotropic APR gene Lr46/Yr29. QYr.cim-2BS was a seedling resistance gene designated as YrF that conferred intermediate seedling reactions and moderate resistance at the adult plant stage in both Mexican and Chinese environments. Significant additive interactions were detected between the six QTL for stripe rust, but not between the four QTL for leaf rust. Furthermore, we detected two new APR loci for leaf rust in common wheat: QLr.cim-3BS.1 and QLr.cim-7DS.

AB Managing wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is imperative for the preservation of global food security. The most effective strategy is pyramiding several resistance genes into adapted wheat cultivars. A search for new resistance sources to Pgt race TTKSK resistance identified a spring wheat landrace, accession PI 626573, as a potentially novel source of resistance. A cross was made between LMPG-6, a susceptible spring wheat line, and PI 626573 and used to develop a recombinant inbred population to map the resistance. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) of LMPG-6/PI 626573 F-2 progeny determined resistance was conferred by a single dominant gene given the provisional designation SrWLR. The BSA identified nine microsatellite (SSR) markers on the long arm of chromosome 2B associated with the resistant phenotype. Fifteen polymorphic SSRs, including the nine identified in the BSA, were used to produce a linkage map of chromosome 2B, positioning SrWLR in an 8.8 cM region between the SSRs GWM47 and WMC332. This region has been reported to contain the wheat stem rust resistance genes Sr9 and SrWeb, the latter conferring resistance to Pgt race TTKSK. The 9,000 marker Illumina Infinium iSelect SNP assay was used to further saturate the SrWLR region. The cosegregating SNP markers IWA6121, IWA6122, IWA7620, IWA8295, and IWA8362 further delimited the SrWLR region distally to a 1.9 cM region. The present study demonstrates the iSelect assay to be an efficient tool to delimit the region of a mapping population and establish syntenic relationships between closely related species.

AB Verticillium wilt (VW) is one of the most destructive diseases of cotton that decreases yield and quality. Identification of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) can provide potential candidate gene markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) for VW resistance and cloning of VW resistance genes. The objective of this study was to convert RGA-targeted RGA-AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) markers into sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. A total of 54 RGA-AFLP markers, including 28 from a backcross inbred line (BIL) population and 26 from a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, were cloned and sequenced. Of the resulted 86 unique sequences, the majority were found to be homologous to genes, some of which showed similarity to genes encoding resistance-related products. A total of 163 STS primer pairs were designed and screened in the BIL population, 72 of which were also screened in the RIL population, resulting in 21 polymorphic STS markers in the BIL population and seven in the RIL population. Twelve STS markers were mapped onto eight chromosomes or linkage groups in the BIL population, six of which were mapped on the same chromosomes with their original RGA-AFLP markers including two STS markers on c4 flanking two VW resistance quantitative trait loci. These STS markers will be useful in MAS in breeding cotton for VW resistance. This study represents the first attempt to successfully convert RGA-AFLP markers into STS for mapping resistance genes in cotton.

AB Vernalization, photoperiod and the relatively poorly defined earliness per se (eps) genes regulate flowering in plants. We report here the validation of a major eps quantitative trait locus (QTL) located on wheat 1DL using near isogenic lines (NILs). We used four independent pairs of NILs derived from a cross between Spark and Rialto winter wheat varieties, grown in both the field and controlled environments. NILs carrying the Spark allele, defined by QTL flanking markers Xgdm111 and Xbarc62, consistently flowered 3-5 days earlier when fully vernalized relative to those with the Rialto. The effect was independent of photoperiod under field conditions, short days (10-h light), long days (16-h light) and very long days (20-h light). These results validate our original QTL identified using doubled haploid (DH) populations. This QTL represents variation maintained in elite north-western European winter wheat germplasm. The two DH lines used to develop the NILs, SR9 and SR23 enabled us to define the location of the 1DL QTL downstream of marker Xgdm111. SR9 has the Spark 1DL arm while SR23 has a recombinant 1DL arm with the Spark allele from Xgdm111 to the distal end. Our work suggests that marker assisted selection of eps effects is feasible and useful even before the genes are cloned. This means eps genes can be defined and positionally cloned in the same way as the photoperiod and vernalization genes have been. This validation study is a first step towards fine mapping and eventually cloning the gene directly in hexaploid wheat.

AB The OsGS3 gene plays a principal role in controlling grain weight and grain length in rice. However, the function of an orthologous gene TaGS in wheat has not been analyzed to date. In the present study, we cloned the gDNA of TaGS gene, designated TaGS-D1, with four exons and three introns on chromosome 7DS by a comparative genomics approach. The cDNA of TaGS-D1 is 255 bp, and it encodes 85 amino acids. We also found a plant-specific organ size regulation domain in the deduced polypeptide, indicating that TaGS-D1, like OsGS3, does not belong to the PEBP family. DNA sequencing of the TaGS-D1 locus revealed no diversity in the coding sequence of exons, but there was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the first intron, and 30 SNPs, a 40-bp InDel and a 3-bp InDel were found in the second intron between genotypes with higher and lower thousand grain weights (TGW). Based on the 40-bp InDel, a co-dominant STS marker, designated GS7D, was developed to discriminate the two alleles. GS7D was 8.0 cM from Xbarc184 located on chromosome 7DS by linkage mapping. A QTL for TGW and grain length at GS7D locus explained up to 16.3 and 7.7 %, respectively, of the phenotypic variances in a RIL population derived from Doumai/Shi 4185 grown in Shijiazhuang and Beijing. One hundred and seventy-five Chinese wheat cultivars were genotyped with GS7D, indicating that TaGS-D1 was significantly associated with grain weight. The allelic distribution at the TaGS-D1 locus showed that the frequencies of TaGS-D1a were high in cultivars from Serbia, Japan, Australia, Canada, and the Northeastern Spring Wheat and Northern Winter Wheat Regions of China.

AB Cultivated lettuce is more sensitive to salinity stress than its wild progenitor species potentially due to differences in root architecture and/or differential uptake and accumulation of sodium. We have identified quantitative trait locis (QTLs) associated with salt-induced changes in root system architecture (RSA) and ion accumulation using a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Salinas') and wild lettuce (L. serriola). Components of RSA were quantified by replicated measurements of seedling growth on vertical agar plates containing different concentrations of NaCl in a controlled growth chamber environment. Accumulation of sodium and potassium ions was measured in replicates of greenhouse-grown plants watered with 100 mM NaCl water. A total of 14 QTLs were identified using multi-trait linkage analysis, including three major QTLs associated with general root development, root growth in salt stress condition, and ion accumulation. The three major QTLs, qRC9.1, qRS2.1, and qLS7.2, were linked with markers E35/M59-F-425, LE9050, and LE1053, respectively. This study provides regions of lettuce genome contributing to salt-induced changes in RSA and ion accumulation. Future fine-mapping of major QTLs will identify candidate genes underlying salt stress tolerance in cultivated lettuce.

AB The purple-leaf phenotype in Chinese cabbage is due to the accumulation of anthocyanin. To investigate the pattern of inheritance of this trait in Brassica rapa, F-1, F-2 and backcross (BC) populations were constructed by crossing 09N-742, a pak-choi inbred line that has purple leaves, with a green-leaved Chinese cabbage inbred line, 09-680. Using a segregating F-2 population, we identified a single dominant gene, BrPur, for purple leaf, and mapped the gene to a locus on linkage group A03 of B. rapa. Furthermore, sequences from BAC clones and other sources were used to develop molecular marker loci that are tightly linked to BrPur by using a BC1 population of 1,152 individuals. BrPur was assigned to a locus between Indel markers BVRCPI613 and BVRCPI431, which defined a genetic interval of 0.6 cM and a genomic region of 54.87 kb. Sequence analysis of this chromosomal region revealed seven open reading frames. These results provide a foundation for map-based cloning, identification, and functional analysis of the BrPur gene in B. rapa.

AB Accelerated wheat development and deployment of high-yielding, climate resilient, and disease resistant cultivars can contribute to enhanced food security and sustainable intensification. To facilitate gene discovery, we assembled an association mapping panel of 528 spring wheat landraces of diverse geographic origin for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). All accessions were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium 9K wheat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip and 4781 polymorphic SNPs were used for analysis. To identify loci underlying resistance to the major leaf spot diseases and to better understand the genomic patterns, we quantified population structure, allelic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium. Our results showed 32 loci were significantly associated with resistance to the major leaf spot diseases. Further analysis identified QTL effective against major leaf spot diseases of wheat which appeared to be novel and others that were previously identified by association analysis using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and bi-parental mapping. In addition, several identified SNPs co-localized with genes that have been implicated in plant disease resistance. Future work could aim to select the putative novel loci and pyramid them in locally adapted wheat cultivars to develop broad-spectrum resistance to multiple leaf spot diseases of wheat via marker-assisted selection (MAS).

AB Background: Crown rust, caused by Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae, is the most important disease of oat worldwide. Adult plant resistance (APR), based upon partial resistance, has proven to be a durable rust management strategy in other cereal rust pathosystems. The crown rust APR in the oat line MN841801 has been effective for more than 30 years. The genetic basis of this APR was studied under field conditions in three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations: 1) AC Assiniboia/MN841801, 2) AC Medallion/MN841801, and 3) Makuru/MN841801. The populations were evaluated for crown rust resistance with the crown rust isolate CR251 (race BRBB) in multiple environments. The 6 K oat and 90 K wheat Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used for genotyping the AC Assiniboia/ MN841801 population. KASP assays were designed for selected SNPs and genotyped on the other two populations.
   Results: This study reports a high density genetic linkage map constructed with oat and wheat SNP markers in the AC Assiniboia/MN841801 RIL population. Most wheat SNPs were monomorphic in the oat population. However the polymorphic wheat SNPs could be scored accurately and integrated well into the linkage map. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on oat chromosome 14D, designated QPc.crc-14D, explained up to 76% of the APR phenotypic variance. This QTL is flanked by two SNP markers, GMI_GBS_90753 and GMI_ES14_c1439_83. QPc.crc-14D was validated in the populations AC Medallion/MN841801 and Makuru/MN841801.
   Conclusions: We report the first APR QTL in oat with a large and consistent effect. QPc.crc-14D was statistically significant in all environments tested in each of the three oat populations. QPc.crc-14D is a suitable candidate for use in marker-assisted breeding and also an excellent target for map-based cloning. This is also the first study to use the 90 K wheat Infinium SNP array on oat for marker development and comparative mapping. The Infinium SNP array is a useful tool for saturating oat maps with markers. Synteny with wheat suggests that QPc.crc-14D is orthologous with the stripe rust APR gene Yr16 in wheat.

   ORIGIN; ASSOCIATION; SPECIATION
AB Background: Cuticular wax production on plant surfaces confers a glaucous appearance and plays important roles in plant stress tolerance. Most common wheat cultivars, which are hexaploid, and most tetraploid wheat cultivars are glaucous; in contrast, a wild wheat progenitor, Aegilops tauschii, can be glaucous or non-glaucous. A dominant non-glaucous allele, Iw2, resides on the short arm of chromosome 2D, which was inherited from Ae. tauschii through polyploidization. Iw2 is one of the major causal genes related to variation in glaucousness among hexaploid wheat. Detailed genetic and phylogeographic knowledge of the Iw2 locus in Ae. tauschii may provide important information and lead to a better understanding of the evolution of common wheat.
   Results: Glaucous Ae. tauschii accessions were collected from a broad area ranging from Armenia to the southwestern coastal part of the Caspian Sea. Linkage analyses with five mapping populations showed that the glaucous versus non-glaucous difference was mainly controlled by the Iw2 locus in Ae. tauschii. Comparative genomic analysis of barley and Ae. tauschii was then used to develop molecular markers tightly linked with Ae. tauschii Iw2. Chromosomal synteny around the orthologous Iw2 regions indicated that some chromosomal rearrangement had occurred during the genetic divergence leading to Ae. tauschii, barley, and Brachypodium. Genetic associations between specific Iw2-linked markers and respective glaucous phenotypes in Ae. tauschii indicated that at least two non-glaucous accessions might carry other glaucousness-determining loci outside of the Iw2 locus.
   Conclusion: Allelic differences at the Iw2 locus were the main contributors to the phenotypic difference between the glaucous and non-glaucous accessions of Ae. tauschii. Our results supported the previous assumption that the D-genome donor of common wheat could have been any Ae. tauschii variant that carried the recessive iw2 allele.

AB Microbiota in the gut play essential roles in human health. Prebiotics are non-digestible complex carbohydrates that are fermented in the colon, yielding energy and short chain fatty acids, and selectively promote the growth of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillae in the gastro-intestinal tract. Fructans and inulin are the best-characterized plant prebiotics. Many vegetable, root and tuber crops as well as some fruit crops are the best-known sources of prebiotic carbohydrates, while the prebiotic-rich grain crops include barley, chickpea, lentil, lupin, and wheat. Some prebiotic-rich crop germplasm have been reported in barley, chickpea, lentil, wheat, yacon, and Jerusalem artichoke. A few major quantitative trait loci and gene-based markers associated with high fructan are known in wheat. More targeted search in genebanks using reduced subsets (representing diversity in germplasm) is needed to identify accessions with prebiotic carbohydrates. Transgenic maize, potato and sugarcane with high fructan, with no adverse effects on plant development, have been bred, which suggests that it is feasible to introduce fructan biosynthesis pathways in crops to produce health-imparting prebiotics. Developing prebiotic-rich and super nutritious crops will alleviate the widespread malnutrition and promote human health. A paradigm shift in breeding program is needed to achieve this goal and to ensure that newly-bred crop cultivars are nutritious, safe and health promoting.

AB Aegilops uniaristata has many agronomically useful traits that can be used for wheat breeding. So far, a Triticum turgidum - Ae. uniaristata amphiploid and one set of Chinese Spring (CS) -Ae. uniaristata addition lines have been produced. To guide Ae. uniaristata chromatin transformation from these lines into cultivated wheat through chromosome engineering, reliable cytogenetic and molecular markers specific for Ae. uniaristata chromosomes need to be developed. Standard C-banding shows that C-bands mainly exist in the centromeric regions of Ae. uniaristata but rarely at the distal ends. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using (GAA)(8) as a probe showed that the hybridization signal of chromosomes 1N-7N are different, thus (GAA) 8 can be used to identify all Ae. uniaristata chromosomes in wheat background simultaneously. Moreover, a total of 42 molecular markers specific for Ae. uniaristata chromosomes were developed by screening expressed sequence tag - sequence tagged site (EST-STS), expressed sequence tag - simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR), and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) primers. The markers were subsequently localized using the CS -Ae. uniaristata addition lines and different wheat cultivars as controls. The cytogenetic and molecular markers developed herein will be helpful for screening and identifying wheat Ae. uniaristata progeny.

AB 'Egan' hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Reg. No. 1102, PI 671855) was developed by the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 2014. Egan is intended for production in areas of Montana infested with the orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM) (Sitodiplosis mosellana Gehin). Egan is resistant to OWBM due to antibiosis conferred by resistance gene Sm1. Egan also contains a chromosome segment originally introgressed into wheat from T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides containing a gene for high protein (Gpc-B1) and a gene for stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici) resistance (Yr36). Egan has shown high yield potential and high grain protein in nurseries grown under OWBM pressure in the Flathead Valley of Montana. Egan is the first hard red spring wheat cultivar with resistance to OWBM developed for Montana.

AB In cereals, the transition from the vegetative stage to flowering is controlled in the main by the set of vernalization genes. Within these genes the most important role is played by VRN1, which encodes a MADS-box transcription factor, regulating the transition of shoot apical meristem to the reproductive phase. The level of vernalization requirement is strongly linked to the molecular structure of this gene. In this study we analyzed molecular mechanisms regulating the vernalization requirement in triticale on the basis of comparative analysis of the VRN1 locus between triticale (xTriticosecale Witt.) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes. We also estimated the influence of VRN genotype on heading time and the winter hardiness of these two species. Molecular markers developed for VRN genotype detection in common wheat were successfully applied to an analysis of triticale genomic DNA. Subsequent analysis of the amplicons nucleotide sequence confirmed full similarity of the products obtained between triticale and common wheat. All winter triticale cultivars tested contained the recessive vrn-A1 allele, whereas all spring genotypes carried the dominant Vrn-A1a allele. Molecular analysis of the Vrn-B1 gene revealed the presence of the dominant Vrn-B1b allele in only one of the triticale genotypes analyzed (Legalo). The major system of determination of the vernalization requirement in triticale was transferred from common wheat without changes and is based on an alteration in the VRN1 gene promoter sequence within the A genome.

AB The oil palm species, Elaeis oleifera although it produces lower oil yield than its African counterpart Elaeis guineensis, does possess certain unique traits that are of interest to breeders. E. oleifera has slower annual height increment, higher level of carotenoids and unsaturated fatty acids. A number of interspecific hybrid crossing programmes have been initiated to introgress the unique characteristics of E. oleifera into high yielding planting materials. As such, an appropriate backcross interspecific hybrid population (BC2) could be used to develop genetic maps and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to traits of interest, which will be potentially helpful in reducing the number of breeding cycles. The objective of this study was to determine the heritability of SSR and SNP loci in oil palm. Seventy-five palms from a BC2 population were selected as the mapping population. A total of 4966 (4451 SNP and 515 SSR) markers were screened and 2135 (43%) were polymorphic and mostly contributed by the female parent. The level of polymorphism exhibited by the BC2 population was similar for both marker systems. Genotyping results revealed a sufficient number of co-dominant polymorphic markers that are important in genetic mapping studies. Chi-square test showed that 87.6% of the markers were in accordance to the expected Mendelian segregation ratios. The results indicated that they are stably inherited and suitable for genetic mapping studies and also have proven to be useful as fingerprinting tools to assess the genetic purity in controlled crosses.

AB A protocol to obtain full-length cDNA using a SuperScriptA (R) Full-Length cDNA Library Construction Kit II (Invitrogen, United States) was developed, and a high quality cDNA library of meristem tissue of finger millet panicle (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn) was constructed. The titer of the constructed cDNA library was 3.01 x 10(5) CFU/mL, the average length of the insert was approximately 1070 base pairs, and the average efficiency of insertion of cDNA fragments was 99.5%. The sequencing of randomly selected clones created cDNA library was carried out. The cDNA sequences of clones were identified by BLAST search. The cDNA library analysis and selective sequencing indicate good functionality and full size of cDNA inserts of the clones. The constructed cDNA library from meristematic tissue of finger millet panicle is a good and reliable source for isolation and identification of key genes of metabolism and development of meristem as well for creation of new genetic markers for genetic research and molecular selection.

AB Changes in plant genomes of hybrid origin which become apparent on different levels of phenotypic manifestation of genetic and epigenetic changes are an important object of cytogenetics and molecular genetics. The changes in expression of the glaucousness trait in the artificial Triticinae amphidiploid Aurotica (AABBTT) were investigated; haplotypes of plants with the appearance of glaucous and non-glaucous genes were determined by hybridization experiments. It was suppoted that the changes in expression can be explained by (epi)mutations abolishing the efficiency of dominant alleles of orthologous series of glaucous inhibitor gene Iw. Analysis of F-2 population with SSR markers specific to 2B and 2D wheat chromosomes and 2T chromosome of Aegilops mutica manifested associated inheritance of the Wms 102 and Wms 702 loci, which mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2D. The Wms 702 marker was linked to the Iw2(T) gene and can now be used to detect that gene.

AB Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) populations are now being utilized to more accurately identify the underlying genetic basis of quantitative traits through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses and subsequent gene discovery. The expanded genetic diversity present in such populations and the amplified number of recombination events mean that QTL can be identified at a higher resolution. Most QTL analyses are conducted separately for each trait within a single environment. Separate analysis does not take advantage of the underlying correlation structure found in multienvironment or multitrait data. By using this information in a joint analysis-be it multienvironment or multitrait - it is possible to gain a greater understanding of genotype-or QTL-by-environment interactions or of pleiotropic effects across traits. Furthermore, this can result in improvements in accuracy for a range of traits or in a specific target environment and can influence selection decisions. Data derived from MAGIC populations allow for founder probabilities of all founder alleles to be calculated for each individual within the population. This presents an additional layer of complexity and information that can be utilized to identify QTL. A whole-genome approach is proposed for multienvironment and multitrait QTL analysis in MAGIC. The whole-genome approach simultaneously incorporates all founder probabilities at each marker for all individuals in the analysis, rather than using a genome scan. A dimension reduction technique is implemented, which allows for high-dimensional genetic data. For each QTL identified, sizes of effects for each founder allele, the percentage of genetic variance explained, and a score to reflect the strength of the QTL are found. The approach was demonstrated to perform well in a small simulation study and for two experiments, using a wheat MAGIC population.

AB MAGIC populations represent one of a new generation of crop genetic mapping resources combining high genetic recombination and diversity. We describe the creation and validation of an eight-parent MAGIC population consisting of 1091 F-7 lines of winter-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analyses based on genotypes from a 90,000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array find the population to be well-suited as a platform for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene isolation. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show the population to be highly recombined; genetic marker diversity among the founders was 74% of that captured in a larger set of 64 wheat varieties, and 54% of SNPs segregating among the 64 lines also segregated among the eight founder lines. In contrast, a commonly used reference bi-parental population had only 54% of the diversity of the 64 varieties with 27% of SNPs segregating. We demonstrate the potential of this MAGIC resource by identifying a highly diagnostic marker for the morphological character "awn presence/absence" and independently validate it in an association-mapping panel. These analyses show this large, diverse, and highly recombined MAGIC population to be a powerful resource for the genetic dissection of target traits in wheat, and it is well-placed to efficiently exploit ongoing advances in phenomics and genomics. Genetic marker and trait data, together with instructions for access to seed, are available at http://www.niab.com/MAGIC/.

AB Two segregating populations of doubled haploid (DH) wheat lines derived androgenetically from crosses 'Svilena' (susceptible) x A-38b-4-5-3-3 (highly resistant) and 'Svilena' x WWRN (moderately resistant to moderately susceptible) were characterized for resistance to common bunt. Disease incidence was evaluated after inoculation of seeds with a mixture of Tilletia foetida teliospores in two autumn sown field experiments. Two-gene model of inheritance of resistance in line A-38b-4-5-3-3 was suggested. The transgressive segregation in the latter population was indicative for a quantitative mode of inheritance. The DH lines were assessed for plant height, heading time and important yield components in a three-year field experiment without bunt infection. In both populations, transgressive segregation was observed for all agronomic characteristics. Although the disease incidence was positively correlated with most of the agronomic traits, genotypes combining bunt resistance with good yield potential were isolated from 'Svilena' x A-38b set of lines. These genotypes are valuable for breeding varieties designed for growing in low-input and organic farming systems. The two DH populations are suitable to be used for further studies on the genetic basis of bunt resistance.

AB Bread wheat quality constitutes a key trait for the demands of the baking industry as well as the broad consumer preferences. The role of the low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) with regard to bread quality is so far not well understood owing to their genetic complexity and to the use of different nomenclatures and standards for the LMW-GS assignment by different research groups, which has made difficult the undertaking of association studies between genotypes and bread quality. The development of molecular markers to carry out genetic characterization and allele determination is demanding. Nowadays, the most promising LMW gene marker system is based on PCR and high resolution capillary electrophoresis for the simultaneous analysis of the complete multigene family. The molecular analysis of the bread wheat Glu-B3 locus in F-2 and F-4:6 populations expressed the expected one-locus Mendelian segregation pattern, thus validating the suitability of this marker system for the characterization of LMW-GS genes in segregating populations, allowing for the successful undertaking of studies related to bread-making quality. Moreover, the Glu-B3 allele characterization of standard cultivars with the molecular marker system has revealed its potential as a complementary tool for the allelic determination of this complex multigene family.

AB Genetic variation in the factors controlling flowering in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) allow it to be grown in a wide range of environments. The aim of this study was to identify genetic determinants of flowering time in winter wheat cultivars adapted to regions of the United States differing in latitude and the duration of cold temperatures during winter. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from the cross between cultivars NC-Neuse and AGS 2000 that are adapted to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions, respectively. We identified a QTL for heading date (HD) in the greenhouse after 4 wk of vernalization, designated Qvdr.nc-5BL, which also had a large effect on winter dormancy release and HD when the population was evaluated in the field at locations in North Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana during 2012 and North Carolina during 2013. However, Qvdr.nc-5BL did not have a significant effect on HD in greenhouse grown plants vernalized for 8 wk or in plants grown in the field at Raleigh, NC during 2011. In those environments where Qvdr.nc-5BL was not significant, a region on chromosome 2B, probably associated with the Ppd-B1 locus, was determined to have a HD effect. Interrogation of the population with gene-based markers for Vrn-B1 and Ppd-B1 suggests that these loci are major determinants of HD in winter wheat and are important for adaptation to diverse growing environments.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, and stem rust, caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici, are economically important diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Stripe rust continues to cause huge economic losses in major wheat-growing regions as new races of the pathogen frequently emerge. Wheat landraces from diverse geographic regions are a potential source of novel rust resistance genes. In search of multiple rust resistance, a total of 652 landrace accessions from 54 countries previously screened for resistance to stem rust pathogen (race Ug99) were tested for resistance to current races of stripe rust in Pullman and Mt. Vernon, WA. Of the accessions, 165 showed resistance to stripe rust in the field, and 30 of them also had resistance to stem rust. The 652 landraces were genotyped with 72 simple sequence repeat markers, and 500 of them had data for 8633 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers covering the whole wheat genome. Genetic analysis based on SNP markers grouped the resistant landraces into nine different clusters in an unweighted pair group with arithmetic mean dendrogram and three groups in principal coordinates analyses, suggesting that resistant genotypes are genetically diverse and are expected to possess diverse resistance genes. Landraces with resistance to stem rust and stripe rust have both global and regional importance as sources of developing new and diverse resistant germplasm.

AB Differential gene expression after Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) infection was compared in near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing in powdery mildew resistance. RNA from Bgt-inoculated and Bgt-uninoculated (control) NILs was used for cDNA-AFLP analysis. A total of 6644 highly reproducible fragments in the Bgt-inoculated NIL and 6255 fragments in the control were generated with 60 primer pairs. Forty-two differential expression fragments (DEFs) produced reliable sequences. Sequence comparison using the National Center for Biotechnology Information database with the basic local alignment search tool (BLASTn) showed that 31 DEFs shared significant similarities with genes known to be involved in disease/defense, energy metabolism, transcription, secondary metabolism, or signal transduction. DEF38 and DEF3 were selected based on their sequence similarity to genes with known functions, and their transcriptional levels were assayed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR for the resistant NIL and the susceptible Jing 411 (control) sampled from the same treatment. The expression levels of DEF38 in the NIL were 1.5-, 2.8-, and 3.1- fold higher after inoculation at 8, 12, and 24 h, respectively, than those in Jing 411. DEF3 was also induced, and a significant expression change was observed in the NIL after Bgt infection. DEF38 contained a serine threonine protein kinase (STPK) domain, and was highly homologous to a stem rust-resistant gene (Rpg5) in barley. A virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system was used to evaluate the function of DEF38. The result indicated that the decreased expression of DEF38 in BSMV: STPK-DEF38-treated seedlings compromised NIL resistance to Bgt. Multiple genes were involved in the response to Bgt infection, and disease resistance genes might play a key role in NILs.

AB An isolate of the basidiomycete Puccinia striiformis, which causes yellow (stripe) rust on wheat, was selfed on the newly discovered alternate host, Berberis vulgaris. This allowed a study of the segregation of molecular markers and virulence in the progeny isolates, and of the development of fungal sexual structures and spore forms. Pycnia and aecia were obtained after inoculation of B. vulgaris with basidiospores resulting from germinating teliospores from infected wheat leaves. Subsequent inoculation of wheat with aeciospores from bulked aecia resulted in 16 progeny isolates of the S1 generation. Genotyping with 42 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers confirmed a parental origin of progeny isolates. Of the 42 analyzed loci, 15 were heterozygous in the parental isolate and 14 revealed segregation in the progenies. This resulted in 11 new multilocus genotypes (MLGs), which confirmed segregation following sexual reproduction. Additionally, parental and progeny isolates were phenotyped using a genetic stock of wheat genotypes representing 21 resistance genes. All S1 progeny isolates had virulence for 14 out of 15 loci where the parental isolate was virulent. This was consistent with the hypothesis that virulence in plant pathogens is often recessive to avirulence, i.e., only expressed in a homozygous state. Furthermore, no segregation was observed for five out of six loci, for which the parental isolate had an avirulent phenotype. The results for one of the two segregating virulence/avirulence loci suggested that the parental isolate was heterozygous with Avr alleles resulting in different but clearly avirulent phenotypes. The other locus indicated that additional genes modifying the phenotypic expression of avirulence were involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Six QTL for adult plant resistance to leaf rust, including two QTL effective against additional diseases, were identified in a RIL population derived from a cross between Shanghai 3/Catbird and Naxos.
   Leaf rust is an important wheat disease and utilization of adult-plant resistance (APR) may be the best approach to achieve long-term protection from the disease. The CIMMYT spring wheat line Shanghai 3/Catbird (SHA3/CBRD) showed a high level of APR to Chinese Puccinia triticina pathotypes in the field. To identify APR genes in this line, a mapping population of 164 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross of this line and Naxos, a moderately susceptible German cultivar. The RILs were evaluated for final disease severity (FDS) at Baoding, Hebei province, and Zhoukou, Henan province, in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 cropping seasons. QTL analysis detected one major QTL derived from SHA3/CBRD on chromosome 2BS explaining from 15 to 37 % of the phenotypic variance across environments. In addition one minor resistance QTL on chromosome 1AL from SHA3/CBRD and four minor QTL from Naxos on chromosomes 2DL, 5B, 7BS, and 7DS were also detected. SHA3/CBRD also possessed seedling resistance gene Lr26, and Naxos contained Lr1 based on gene postulation following tests with an array of P. triticina pathotypes and molecular marker assays. These seedling resistance and APR genes and their closely linked molecular markers are potentially useful for improving leaf rust resistance in wheat breeding programs.

TI Lr70, a new gene for leaf rust resistance mapped in common wheat

AB KU3198 is a common wheat accession that carries one novel leaf rust resistance (Lr) gene, Lr70 , and another Lr gene which is either novel, Lr52 or an allele of Lr52.
   Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. (Pt), is a broadly distributed and economically important disease of wheat. Deploying cultivars carrying effective leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes is a desirable method of disease control. KU3198 is a common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accession from the Kyoto collection that was highly resistant to Pt in Canada. An F-2 population from the cross HY644/KU3198 showed segregation for two dominant Lr genes when tested with Pt race MBDS which was virulent on HY644. Multiple bulk segregant analysis (MBSA) was employed to find putative chromosome locations of these Lr genes using SSR markers that provided coverage of the genome. MBSA predicted that the Lr genes were located on chromosomes 5B and 5D. A doubled haploid population was generated from the cross of JBT05-714 (HY644*3/KU3198), a line carrying one of the Lr genes from KU3198, to Thatcher. This population segregated for a single Lr gene conferring resistance to Pt race MBDS, which was mapped to the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 5B with SSR markers and given the temporary designation LrK1. One F-3 family derived from the HY644/KU3198 F-2 population that segregated only for the second Lr gene from KU3198 was identified. This family was treated as an F-2-equivalent population and used for mapping the Lr gene, which was located to the terminal region of chromosome 5DS. As no other Lr gene has been mapped to 5DS, this gene is novel and has been designated as Lr70.

AB We detected several, most likely novel QTL for adult plant resistance to rusts. Notably three QTL improved resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust simultaneously indicating broad spectrum resistance QTL.
   The rusts of wheat (Puccinia spp.) are destructive fungal wheat diseases. The deployment of resistant cultivars plays a central role in integrated rust disease management. Durability of resistance would be preferred, but is difficult to analyse. The Austrian winter wheat cultivar Capo was released in the 1989 and grown on a large acreage during more than two decades and maintained a good level of quantitative leaf rust and stripe rust resistance. Two bi-parental mapping populations: Capo x Arina and Capo x Furore were tested in multiple environments for severity of leaf rust and stripe rust at the adult plant stage in replicated field experiments. Quantitative trait loci associated with leaf rust and stripe rust severity were mapped using DArT and SSR markers. Five QTL were detected in multiple environments associated with resistance to leaf rust designated as QLr.ifa-2AL, QLr.ifa-2BL, QLr.ifa-2BS, QLr.ifa-3BS, and QLr.ifa-5BL, and five for resistance to stripe rust QYr.ifa-2AL, QYr.ifa-2BL, QYr.ifa-3AS, QYr.ifa-3BS, and QYr.ifa-5A. For all QTL apart from two (QYr.ifa-3AS, QLr.ifa-5BL) Capo contributed the resistance improving allele. The leaf rust and stripe rust resistance QTL on 2AL, 2BL and 3BS mapped to the same chromosome positions, indicating either closely linked genes or pleiotropic gene action. These three multiple disease resistance QTL (QLr.ifa-2AL/QYr.ifa-2AL, QLr.ifa.2BL/QYr.ifa-2BL, QLr.ifa-3BS/QYr.ifa.3BS) potentially contribute novel resistance sources for stripe rust and leaf rust. The long-lasting resistance of Capo apparently rests upon a combination of several genes. The described germplasm, QTL and markers are applicable for simultaneous resistance improvement against leaf rust and stripe rust.

AB Leaf rust and stripe rust are important diseases of wheat and can be controlled by growing resistant varieties. We investigated the genetic basis of resistance to both rusts in 198 F-5 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between 'Avocet' and 'Francolin#1'. The population was phenotyped in greenhouse and field, and genotyped with known gene-associated molecular markers. Seedling resistance of Francolin#1 to leaf and stripe rusts was attributed to the loosely linked genes Lr16 and YrF, respectively, with a recombination frequency of 0.36. Field segregation indicated that adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf and stripe rusts was conferred by three and five additive genes, respectively. Among them, Lr46/Yr29 was associated with resistance to both rusts in Francolin#1, Lr16 reduced field leaf rust severity by 8 to 9%, and YrF contributed to 10 to 25% reductions in stripe rust severity. The Lr16 region was also associated with a 5 to 16% reduction in stripe rust severity, which is likely due to its linkage with YrF or another unidentified stripe rust APR gene. Significant additive effects on stripe rust were detected between YrF and Yr29. We conclude that APR in Francolin#1 to leaf and stripe rusts involves a combination of seedling and APR genes.

AB Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was conducted on data generated from two pot experiments carried out in 2005 (using four nitrogen rates) and 2008 (with three rates) with AFLP markers and 94 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the Prisma x Apex mapping population. In total 41 QTLs were detected on 6 chromosomes and for 18 traits in both trials. About 95 % of the detected QTLs were with major additive effects. The percentage of variance accounted for by individual QTLs in the multiple QTL mapping model ranged from 8.4 to 54.4 % across all mapped traits in both years. Fifteen QTLs were related to NUE and its components; most of these QTLs were detected at lower nitrogen rates and none at the highest rate in both trials. These QTLs were found on Chromosomes 3(3H) and 7(5H) in 2005 and Chromosome 2(2H) in 2008. Except for the QTLs of plant height and NUE based on grain yield, none of the QTLs which were detected for a given trait in 2005, expressed themselves in 2008 irrespective of the nitrogen levels. QTLs controlling some traits were co-located in each year, and QTLs for many traits were detected on the same chromosome and close to the denso locus. Further research is needed to investigate the possibility to reduce nitrogen fertilizer requirements through breeding while maintaining high yield of barley.

AB Sugarcane supplies raw material for several by-products, speciality sugar and ethanol is highly productive, but presents high phenotypic variability due to its genetic complexity, polyploidy and gene duplication; these factors limit genetic advances and productivity gains. The application of linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based association mapping is an alternative powerful molecular tool to dissect and exploit the genetic diversity in sugarcane and greatly accelerating plant breeding marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs. However, the extent of genome-wide LD has not been determined in sugarcane. We select nine genes coding for agronomic traits of interest and primers EST-SSRs was obtained for application in 80 improved genotypes and in 16 non-improved genotypes with phenotype identified from vegetative growth, biomass accumulation and sugars was obtained 210 amplicons of which 115 were polymorphic, on average 23.2 alleles was obtained in the each primer combination and the polymorphism information content was between 0.48 and 0.69. The genotypic analysis structured five groups with genetic distance of similar to 0.8 between different groups. Genotype-phenotype expression was detected with allele-specific with distance 5-43 cM of agronomic trait. These ESTs-SSRs allele-specific can be appointed to the MAS in sugarcane plant breeding.

AB Hordeum californicum (2n = 2x = 14, HH) is resistant to several wheat diseases and tolerant to lower nitrogen. In this study, a molecular karyotype of H. californicum chromosomes in the Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring (CS)-H. californicum amphidiploid (2n = 6x = 56, AABBDDHH) was established. By genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using repetitive DNA clones (pTa71, pTa794 and pSc119.2) as probes, the H. californicum chromosomes could be differentiated from each other and from the wheat chromosomes unequivocally. Based on molecular karyotype and marker analyses, 12 wheat-alien chromosome lines, including four disomic addition lines (DAH1, DAH3, DAH5 and DAH6), five telosomic addition lines (MtH7L, MtH1S, MtH1L, DtH6S and DtH6L), one multiple addition line involving H. californicum chromosome H2, one disomic substitution line (DSH4) and one translocation line (TH7S/1BL), were identified from the progenies derived from the crosses of CS-H. californicum amphidiploid with common wheat varieties. A total of 482 EST (expressed sequence tag) or SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers specific for individual H. californicum chromosomes were identified, and 47, 50, 45, 49, 21, 51 and 40 markers were assigned to chromosomes H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 and H7, respectively. According to the chromosome allocation of these markers, chromosomes H2, H3, H4, H5, and H7 of H. californicum have relationship with wheat homoeologous groups 5, 2, 6, 3, and 1, and hence could be designated as 5H(c), 2H(c), 6H(c), 3H(c) and 1H(c), respectively. The chromosomes H1 and H6 were designated as 7H(c) and 4H(c), respectively, by referring to SSR markers located on rye chromosomes.

AB To better understand the transcriptional regulation of high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) expression, we isolated four Glu-1Bx promoters from six wheat cultivars exhibiting diverse protein expression levels. The activities of the diverse Glu-1Bx promoters were tested and compared with beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter fusions. Although all the full-length Glu-1Bx promoters showed endosperm-specific activities, the strongest GUS activity was observed with the 1Bx7(OE) promoter in both transient expression assays and stable transgenic rice lines. A 43 bp insertion in the 1Bx7(OE) promoter, which is absent in the 1Bx7 promoter, led to enhanced expression. Analysis of promoter deletion constructs confirmed that a 185 bp MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable element) in the 1Bx14 promoter had a weak positive effect on Glu-1Bx expression, and a 54 bp deletion in the 1Bx13 promoter reduced endosperm-specific activity. To investigate the effect of the 43 bp insertion in the 1Bx7(OE) promoter, a functional marker was developed to screen 505 Chinese varieties and 160 European varieties, and only 1Bx7-type varieties harboring the 43 bp insertion in their promoters showed similar overexpression patterns. Hence, the 1Bx7(OE) promoter should be important tool in crop genetic engineering as well as in molecular assisted breeding.

AB A complete diallel cross study of six inbred lines (KKU-BK, KKU-JP, KKU-UB, KKU-JD, KKU-G2 and KKU-N7) of waxy corn was carried out with parents and F-1 progeny, to determine the combining ability of starch pasting viscosity characteristics across two environments in Thailand. The relative importance of additive vs. non-additive gene effects was determined. Analysis of variance for all parameters indicated highly significant differences among genotypes and genotype x environment interactions. The general combining ability (GCA) component of variance was significant for most traits, while specific combining ability (SCA) was significant for all of the pasting properties examined, but reciprocal effects were significant except for pasting temperature. Additive gene effects were most important only for peak viscosity; also, the magnitude of GCA variance was more pronounced than SCA variance for this characteristic. However, higher estimates of non-additive genetic variance were noticed for breakdown viscosity, final viscosity, setback viscosity and pasting temperature. Accordingly, the parents KKU-JP and KKU-UB used in this study appear to be suitable parents for use in breeding programs where improved pasting viscosity traits are desired.

AB The overexpression of wheat Bx7 subunit (Bx7(OE)) encoded by the Glu-B1al allele is originated from a duplication event of the Bx7 gene, and has a positive effect on gluten strength. Thus, it is an important genetic resource for wheat quality improvement. In this study, the Bx7(OE) subunit from a large number of bread wheat and related species was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Sequence-Tagged sites (STS) markers. Only 31 bread wheat varieties were found to carry Bx7(OE). RP-HPLC quantification analysis revealed that the mean proportion of the Bx7(OE) subunit to the total amount of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits among the 31 bread wheat varieties was 41.8%, which is much higher than that of varieties with the normal Bx7 subunit (generally at 30%). Flour quality analysis of seven representative varieties with Bx7(OE) and three with the normal Bx7 subunit showed that the varieties with Bx7(OE) generally displayed better gluten strength than those with the normal Bx7 subunit. STS markers demonstrated that, in addition to the 31 bread wheat varieties with Bx7(OE), no PCR products were obtained from the related Triticum and Aegilops species. This suggests that the retroelement-mediated recombination event at the Glu-B1 locus could have occurred more recently, later than the formation of hexaploid wheat. The Bx7(OE) subunit is mainly distributed in some bread wheat varieties from American countries with a low frequency, which is of particular importance for the quality improvement of wheat gluten.

AB Stripe rust, a major disease in areas where cool temperatures prevail, can strongly influence grain yield. To control this disease, breeders have incorporated seedling resistance genes from a variety of sources outside the primary wheat gene pool. The wheat line C51, introduced from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Syria, confers resistance to all races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST) in China. To map the resistant gene(s) against stripe rust in wheat line C51, 212 F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross X440 x C51 were inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR33 (Chinese yellow rust, CYR) in the greenhouse. The result showed that C51 carried a single dominant gene for resistance (designated YrC51) to CYR33. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and resistance gene-analogue polymorphism (RGAP) markers that were polymorphic between the parents were used for genotyping the 212 F-8 RILs. YrC51 was closely linked to two SSR loci on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 5.1 cM (Xgwm429) and 7.2 cM (Xwmc770), and to three RGAP markers C51R1 (XLRR For / NLRR For), C51R2 (CLRR Rev / Cre3LR-F) and C51R3 (Pto kin4/ NLRR-INV2) with genetic distances of 5.6, 1.6 and 9.2 cM, respectively. These RGAP-linked markers were then converted into STS markers. Among them, one STS marker, C51STS-4, was located at a genetic distance of 1.4 cM to YrC51 and was closely associated with resistance when validated in several populations derived from crosses between C51 and Sichuan cultivars. The results indicated that C51STS-4 can be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) and would facilitate the pyramiding of YrC51 with other genes for stripe rust resistance.

AB Heading of cereals is determined by complex genetic and environmental factors in which genes responsible for vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity play a decisive role. Our aim was to use diagnostic molecular markers to determine the main allele types in VRN-A1, VRN-B1, VRN-D1, PPD-B1 and PPD-D1 in a worldwide wheat collection of 683 genotypes and to investigate the effect of these alleles on heading in the field. The dominant VRN-A1, VRN-B1 and VRN-D1 alleles were present at a low frequency. The PPD-D1a photoperiod-insensitive allele was carried by 57 % of the cultivars and was most frequent in Asian and European cultivars. The PPD-B1 photoperiod-insensitive allele was carried by 22 % of the genotypes from Asia, America and Europe. Nine versions of the PPD-B1-insensitive allele were identified based on gene copy number and intercopy structure. The allele compositions in PPD-D1, PPD-B1 and VRN-D1 significantly influenced heading and together explained 37.5 % of the phenotypic variance. The role of gene model increased to 39.1 % when PPD-B1 intercopy structure was taken into account instead of overall PPD-B1 type (sensitive vs. insensitive). As a single component, PPD-D1 had the most important role (28.0 % of the phenotypic variance), followed by PPD-B1 (12.3 % for PPD-B1_overall, and 15.1 % for PPD-B1_intercopy) and VRN-D1 (2.2 %). Significant gene interactions were identified between the marker alleles within PPD-B1 and between VRN-D1 and the two PPD1 genes. The earliest heading genotypes were those with the photoperiod-insensitive allele in PPD-D1 and PPD-B1, and with the spring allele for VRN-D1 and the winter alleles for VRN-A1 and VRN-B1. This combination could only be detected in genotypes from Southern Europe and Asia. Late-heading genotypes had the sensitivity alleles for both PPD1 genes, regardless of the allelic composition of the VRN1 genes. There was a 10-day difference in heading between the earliest and latest groups under field conditions.

AB Genome-wide association mapping revealed the genetic architecture of resistance to tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis in a population of 358 European winter wheat varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties (Triticum aestivum L.). Based on field data in two environments and the resulting best linear estimations, a total of 90 marker-trait associations were significant with -log(10)(P) > 3.0 by using a mixed linear model corrected with a kinship matrix. While the inheritance pattern of resistance to tan spot appeared to be quantitative, a number of already-known resistance or susceptibility loci were confirmed, such as Tsn1 on chromosome 5B, tsn2 or tsn5 on chromosome 3B and Tsc2 or Tsr6 on chromosome 2B. Additionally, evidence for novel loci was gathered. Additive effects of favourable or unfavourable alleles were observed and suggest the application of genomic selection as a possible strategy for further variety development.

AB Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide. The basis for wheat powdery mildew resistance breeding consists of screening diversified host genetic resources with a range of races of the powdery mildew pathogen. Spelt wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) is a close relative of common wheat (T. aestivum ssp. aestivum) and contains several known disease resistance genes, including Pm1d, Yr5, and Lr65. Here, we report the identification and mapping of a powdery mildew resistance gene in spelt wheat cultivar Hubel, which was introduced to China from Europe and is resistant to Chinese Bgt isolate E09 at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross of Hubel and a susceptible early maturing mutant line indicated that Hubel possessed a recessive powdery mildew resistance gene (temporarily designated MlHubel). Markers linked to MlHubel were identified using bulked segregant analysis, simple sequence repeat, and expressed sequence tag-derived sequence tagged site methods. The linked markers were physically located on wheat chromosome 2D. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that the genetic interval covering MlHubel in wheat is highly colinear with the corresponding regions on Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 5 and Oryza sativa chromosome 4. Accordingly, the genetic map of MlHubel was established in comparison with B. distachyon 5L and O. sativa 4L, with the closest marker Xgwm265 being 0.4 cM from MlHubel. The identification of the recessive powdery mildew gene in spelt wheat suggests the potential of this accession along with its closely linked markers in breeding for resistance to powdery mildew.

AB Quantitative resistance is generally associated with several genes, located in quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Although often described as non-isolate-specific and durable, some cases of erosion of this resistance have been observed. The likelihood of an erosion of quantitative resistance could be reduced, provided that this resistance rests on diversified mechanisms. We hypothesized that QTLs phenotypically expressed on different components, govern different mechanisms of resistance. A doubled haploid population of 91 lines, derived from a cross between the wheat cultivars Apache and Balance, was used to identify leaf rust resistance QTLs. After establishing a linkage map with 355 markers, 13 QTLs were found involved in field resistance, for over 2 years in two locations. Ten of these QTLs were associated with five resistance components (infection efficiency, latent period, lesion size, spore production per lesion and spore production per unit of sporulating tissue) measured in two greenhouse experiments. All but one of the QTLs found in the greenhouse were associated with one or two resistance components, supporting the hypothesis that different genetic factors are mostly involved in the expression of different resistance components. Analyzing separately different field scoring dates revealed QTLs involved at different stages of the epidemic. The QTLs displayed different degrees of isolate-specificity on field resistance, as measured by LOD scores and R-2, leading to the conclusion that isolate-specificity is both a qualitative and quantitative feature of quantitative resistance. A profile of each QTL was drawn, to evaluate its usefulness according to the objectives of the breeding program.

AB Early-life interventions in the intestinal environment have previously been shown to influence diabetes incidence. We therefore hypothesized that a gluten-free (GF) diet, known to decrease the incidence of type 1 diabetes, would protect against the development of diabetes when fed only during the pregnancy and lactation period. Pregnant nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice were fed a GF or standard diet until all pups were weaned to a standard diet. The early-life GF environment dramatically decreased the incidence of diabetes and insulitis. Gut microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a pronounced difference between both mothers and their offspring on different diets, characterized by increased numbers of Akkermansia, Proteobacteria, and TM7 in the GF diet group. In addition, pancreatic forkhead box P3 regulatory T cells were increased in GF-fed offspring, as were M2 macrophage gene markers and tight junction-related genes in the gut, while intestinal gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced. An increased proportion of T cells in the pancreas expressing the mucosal integrin alpha 4 beta 7 suggests that the mechanism involves increased trafficking of gut-primed immune cells to the pancreas. In conclusion, a GF diet during fetal and early postnatal life reduces the incidence of diabetes. The mechanism may involve changes in gut microbiota and shifts to a less proinflammatory immunological milieu in the gut and pancreas.

AB Uremia Salt Lake, in North West Iran, has a hyper-saline water. A rare highly salinity-tolerant grass species, Aegilops cylindrica grows along its shores. Salinity tolerance of 44 genotypes of Ae. cylindrica, mainly collected from the Lake, was evaluated under control and 400 mM NaCl conditions using the physiological traits of plant height, dry weight, proline content, Na+ and K+ concentrations as well as K+/Na+ ratio. To evaluate the association between microsatellite (EST-SSR and SSR) markers and salinity tolerance, 35 primer pairs were used. Results showed a significant variation in the 44 genotypes studied in terms of their traits except for proline content. Ten most salinity-tolerant genotypes were identified based on their ability to survive, to produce the highest dry weight, and to sustain the least leaf Na+ concentration under salinity stress. The very high negative correlation found between Na+ concentration and salinity tolerance revealed the importance of individual or a combination of Na+ exclusion and excretion mechanisms contributing to the hyper-salinity tolerance of these genotypes. Clustering analysis based on marker data divided the 44 studied genotypes into two groups that were consistent with their saline and non-saline geographical areas. Results of molecular markers showed that four microsatellite markers (Xgwm312, Xwmc170, Xgwm291 and Xgwm410) generated a distinguished banding pattern in ten most salinity-tolerant genotypes. These results supported previous reports on their linkage with Na+ exclusion genes (HKT1;5 and HKT1;4) in wheat, which provided further evidence of usefulness of both genes and the linked markers to the salinity tolerance of the halophytic grass family species.

AB Stripe rust resistance gene YrC591, present in wheat cultivar C591, is effective against currently important Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici isolates in China. An F-2:3 population (127 lines) was developed by crossing C591 with susceptible cultivar Taichung 29. Thirty four simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 155 sequence tagged site (STS) markers located on chromosome 7BL were used to perform bulk segregant analysis. Eight SSR markers, cfa2040, wmc273, wmc166, gwm984, barc32 wmc276, barc182 and gwm146, and 6 STS markers, mag1714, mag1757, mag1811, BE425120, BE471173 and BG607810, were polymorphic between the parents and contrasting resistant and susceptible DNA pools. F-2:3 lines were genotyped with these polymorphic markers. Linkage analysis indicated that YrC591 was flanked by Xmag1714 and Xbarc182 with genetic distances of 1.2 and 0.4 cM, respectively. In addition, validation of the SSR markers cfa2040, wmc273 and barc32, and STS markers mag1714 and BE425120 was carried out using wheat lines with C591 as a parent, indicating that these markers should be effective in tracing this gene in marker-assisted selection.

AB Aluminium (Al) toxicity in acid soils continues to be a major concern for crop production, especially for wheat which is a moderately tolerant cereal crop species. So far, Al tolerance was known to be controlled by few genetic loci detected clearly by classical mapping studies. Here, we report the outcome of a genome wide association mapping approach in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using 525 Diversity Array Technology markers genotyped in a core collection of 96 winter wheat accessions. Marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected using both general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM). Five significant MTAs were identified as shared by models on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 3B and 6A. Highly significant MTAs were identified by MLM on chromosomes 1D and 3B which could be new candidate loci for future studies. Some of our results are in line with prior reports, but some appear to be novel. Potential candidate genes have been searched in respective chromosomal bins for highly significant MTAs detected by MLM. The loci identified in our study have the potential to improve Al tolerance in wheat and hence need to be verified and utilized for breeding tolerant cultivars worldwide.

AB A complete set of monosomic alien addition lines of Brassica napus with one of the seven chromosomes of Isatis indigotica and the recombinant mitochondria was developed and characterized.
   Monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) are valuable for elucidating the genome structure and transferring the useful genes and traits in plant breeding. Isatis indigotica (Chinese woad, 2n = 14, II) in Isatideae tribe of Brassicaceae family has been widely cultivated as a medicinal and dye plant in China. Herein, the intertribal somatic hybrid (2n = 52, AACCII) between B. napus cv. Huashuang 3 (2n = 38, AACC) and I. indigotica produced previously was backcrossed recurrently to parental B. napus, and 32 MAAL plants were isolated. Based on their phenotype, 5S and 45S rDNA loci and chromosome-specific SSR markers, these MAALs were classified into seven groups corresponding to potential seven types of MAALs carrying one of the seven I. indigotica chromosomes. One of the MAALs could be distinguishable by expressing the brown anthers of I. indigotica, other two hosted the chromosome with 5S or 45S rDNA locus, but the remaining four were identifiable by SSR markers. The simultaneous detection of the same SSR maker and gene locus in different MAALs revealed the paralogs on the chromosomes involved. The recombinant mitochondrial genome in MAALs was likely related with their male sterility with carpellody stamens, while the MAAL with normal brown anthers probably carried the restoring gene for the male sterility. The complete set of MAALs should be useful for exploiting the I. indigotica genome and for promoting the introgression of valuable genes to B. napus.

AB Wheat stem rust resistance gene SrWeb is an allele at the Sr9 locus that confers resistance to Ug99.
   Race TTKSK (Ug99) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal fungus of stem rust, threatens global wheat production because of its broad virulence to current wheat cultivars. A recently identified Ug99 resistance gene from cultivar Webster, temporarily designated as SrWeb, mapped near the stem rust resistance gene locus Sr9. We determined that SrWeb is also present in Ug99 resistant cultivar Gabo 56 by comparative mapping and an allelism test. Analysis of resistance in a population segregating for both Sr9e and SrWeb demonstrated that SrWeb is an allele at the Sr9 locus, which subsequently was designated as Sr9h. Webster and Gabo 56 were susceptible to the Ug99-related race TTKSF+ from South Africa. Race TTKSF+ possesses unique virulence to uncharacterized Ug99 resistance in cultivar Matlabas. This result validated that resistance to Ug99 in Webster and Gabo 56 is conferred by the same gene: Sr9h. The emergence of pathogen virulence to several resistance genes that are effective to the original Ug99 race TTKSK, including Sr9h, suggests that resistance genes should be used in combinations in order to increase resistance durability.

AB Successful introgression of a major QTL for rust resistance, through marker-assisted backcrossing, in three popular Indian peanut cultivars generated several promising introgression lines with enhanced rust resistance and higher yield.
   Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia arachidis Speg, is one of the major devastating diseases in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). One QTL region on linkage group AhXV explaining upto 82.62 % phenotypic variation for rust resistance was validated and introgressed from cultivar 'GPBD 4' into three rust susceptible varieties ('ICGV 91114', 'JL 24' and 'TAG 24') through marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC). The MABC approach employed a total of four markers including one dominant (IPAHM103) and three co-dominant (GM2079, GM1536, GM2301) markers present in the QTL region. After 2-3 backcrosses and selfing, 200 introgression lines (ILs) were developed from all the three crosses. Field evaluation identified 81 ILs with improved rust resistance. Those ILs had significantly increased pod yields (56-96 %) in infested environments compared to the susceptible parents. Screening of selected 43 promising ILs with 13 markers present on linkage group AhXV showed introgression of the target QTL region from the resistant parent in 11 ILs. Multi-location field evaluation of these ILs should lead to the release of improved varieties. The linked markers may be used in improving rust resistance in peanut breeding programmes.

AB We have demonstrated that genomic selection in diverse wheat landraces for resistance to leaf, stem and strip rust is possible, as genomic breeding values were moderately accurate. Markers with large effects in the Bayesian analysis confirmed many known genes, while also discovering many previously uncharacterised genome regions associated with rust scores.
   Genomic selection, where selection decisions are based on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) derived from genome-wide DNA markers, could accelerate genetic progress in plant breeding. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of GEBVs for rust resistance in 206 hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) landraces from the Watkins collection of phenotypically diverse wheat genotypes from 32 countries. The landraces were genotyped for 5,568 SNPs using an Illumina iSelect 9 K bead chip assay and phenotyped for field-based leaf rust (Lr), stem rust (Sr) and stripe rust (Yr) responses across multiple years. Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and a Bayesian Regression method (BayesR) were used to predict GEBVs. Based on fivefold cross-validation, the accuracy of genomic prediction averaged across years was 0.35, 0.27 and 0.44 for Lr, Sr and Yr using GBLUP and 0.33, 0.38 and 0.30 for Lr, Sr and Yr using BayesR, respectively. Inclusion of PCR-predicted genotypes for known rust resistance genes increased accuracy more substantially when the marker was diagnostic (Lr34/Sr57/Yr18) for the presence-absence of the gene rather than just linked (Sr2). Investigation of the impact of genetic relatedness between validation and reference lines on accuracy of genomic prediction showed that accuracy will be higher when each validation line had at least one close relationship to the reference lines. Overall, the prediction accuracies achieved in this study are encouraging, and confirm the feasibility of genomic selection in wheat. In several instances, estimated marker effects were confirmed by published literature and results of mapping experiments using Watkins accessions.

AB A high level of genetic diversity was found in the A. E. Watkins bread wheat landrace collection. Genotypic information was used to determine the population structure and to develop germplasm resources.
   In the 1930s A. E. Watkins acquired landrace cultivars of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from official channels of the board of Trade in London, many of which originated from local markets in 32 countries. The geographic distribution of the 826 landrace cultivars of the current collection, here called the Watkins collection, covers many Asian and European countries and some from Africa. The cultivars were genotyped with 41 microsatellite markers in order to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of the collection. A high level of genetic diversity was found, higher than in a collection of modern European winter bread wheat varieties from 1945 to 2000. Furthermore, although weak, the population structure of the Watkins collection reveals nine ancestral geographical groupings. An exchange of genetic material between ancestral groups before commercial wheat-breeding started would be a possible explanation for this. The increased knowledge regarding the diversity of the Watkins collection was used to develop resources for wheat research and breeding, one of them a core set, which captures the majority of the genetic diversity detected. The understanding of genetic diversity and population structure together with the availability of breeding resources should help to accelerate the detection of new alleles in the Watkins collection.

AB Fine mapping by recombinant backcross populations revealed that a preharvest sprouting QTL on 2B contained two QTLs linked in coupling with different effects on the phenotype.
   Wheat preharvest sprouting (PHS) occurs when grain germinates on the plant before harvest, resulting in reduced grain quality. Previous mapping of quantitative trait locus (QTL) revealed a major PHS QTL, QPhs.cnl-2B.1, located on chromosome 2B significant in 16 environments that explained from 5 to 31 % of the phenotypic variation. The objective of this project was to fine map the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval. Fine mapping was carried out in recombinant backcross populations (BC1F4 and BC1F5) that were developed by backcrossing selected doubled haploids to a recurrent parent and self-pollinating the BC1F4 and BC1F5 generations. In each generation, three markers in the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval were used to screen for recombinants. Fine mapping revealed that the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval contained two PHS QTLs linked in coupling. The distal PHS QTL, located between Wmc453c and Barc55, contributed 8 % of the phenotypic variation and also co-located with a major seed dormancy QTL determined by germination index. The proximal PHS QTL, between Wmc474 and CNL415-rCDPK, contributed 16 % of the variation. Several candidate genes including Mg-chelatase H subunit family protein, GTP-binding protein and calmodulin/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase were linked to the PHS QTL. Although many recombinant lines were identified, the lack of polymorphism for markers in the QTL interval prevented the localization of the recombination breakpoints and identification of the gene underlying the phenotype.

AB The objective of the present study was to analyse the genetic basis of falling number in three winter wheat populations. Samples for falling number determination for each population originated from at least three Lest environments that were free from the occurrence of preharvest sprouting at harvest time. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis employing falling number values from single environments identified eight, five and three QTL in the populations Dream/Lynx, Bussard/W332-84 and BAUB469511/Format, respectively. A major QTL common to all three populations and consistently detected in each environment mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7B. The QTL was located to a similar genomic region as the previously described major QTL for high-isoelectric point a-amylase content. The T1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation and the dwarfing gene Rht-D1 segregating in Dream/Lynx and BAUB469511/Format were found to be important factors of falling number variation. In both populations die presence of Rht-D1b or die absence of T1BL.1RS increased falling number. The results indicate that late maturity alpha-amylase, responsible for low falling numbers, has now been documented in German wheat germplasm.

AB Near-isogenic line of the common spring wheat cultivar 'Saratovskaya 29', designated 'i:S29Ra', has been earlier developed during eight backcrosses and selection for the red auricle colour inherited from donor 'Ulyanovka'. In this study, the line 'i:S29Ra' was characterized using 274 molecular and a number of morphological markers. It was found that the donor's genome material in 'i:S29Ra' is presented by a fragment on chromosome 7D flanked by the microsatellite loci Xgwm0044 and Xgwm1481 and carrying cluster of the genes Rc-D1 (red coleoptile), Pc-D1 (purple culm), Pls-D1 (purple leaf sheaths), Plb-D1 (purple leaf blades) and Ra-D1 (red auricles), conferring intensive anthocyanin pigmentation of the coleoptile, culm, leaf sheaths, leaf blades and auricles, respectively. The Ra-D1 is a novel locus described in wheat. The relative anthocyanin contents (01)530) in different parts of wheat plant and expression level of the anthocyanin biosynthesis (AB) structural genes in auricles were compared between 'i:S29Ra' and 'S29'. In auricles of 'i:S29Ra', the OD530 (optical density) value was twice higher and transcription of some AB structural genes was increased in comparison with 'S29', suggesting regulatory role of the Ra gene in anthocyanin biosynthesis in wheat.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is the most common and widespread disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Deployment of host-plant resistance is one of the strategies to reduce losses due to leaf rust disease. The objective of this study was to map genes for adult-plant resistance to leaf rust in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population originating from MN98550-5/MN99394-1. The mapping population of 139 RILs and five checks were evaluated in 2005, 2009, and 2010 in five environments. Natural infection occurred in the 2005 trials and trials in 2009 and 2010 were inoculated with leaf rust. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 2BS, 2DS, 7AL, and 7DS were detected. The QTL on 2BS explained up to 33.6% of the phenotypic variation in leaf rust response, whereas the QTL on 2DS, 7AL, and 7DS explained up to 15.7, 8.1, and 34.2%, respectively. Seedling infection type tests conducted with P. triticina races BBBD and SBDG confirmed that the QTL on 2BS and 2DS were Lr16 and Lr2a, respectively, and these genes were expressed in the seedling and field plot tests. The Lr2a gene mapped at the same location as Sr6. The QTL on 7DS was Lr34. The QTL on 7AL is a new QTL for leaf rust resistance. The joint effects of all four QTL explained 74% of the total phenotypic variation in leaf rust severity. Analysis of different combinations of QTL showed that the RILs containing all four or three of the QTL had the lowest average leaf rust severity in all five environments. Deployment of these QTL in combination or with other effective genes will lead to successful control of leaf rust.

AB Members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC) cause Fusarium head blight in small cereal grains all over the world. To determine the species and trichothecene chemotype composition and population structure of FGSC in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, an area where epidemics occur regularly, 891 isolates were collected in two consecutive years (2011 and 2012) and characterized with species- and chemotype-specific polymerase chain reaction. Of the 891 isolates typed, 83 were F. graminearum sensu stricto (s. str.) and 808 were F. asiaticum. All 83 F. graminearum s. str. isolates were of a 3ADON (26.51 %) or 15ADON (73.49 %) type, while F. asiaticum isolates included 696 3ADON producers, 46 15ADON producers, and 66 NIV producers. Eight variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers were tested on a representative 384 F. asiaticum isolates from 55 sampling sites. VNTR analysis showed high gene diversity and genotypic diversity but low linkage disequilibrium in both populations Fg2011 and Fg2012 grouped based on the year of collection. Low genetic differentiation (F (ST) = 0.026) and high gene flow (N (m) = 15.13) was observed between the two populations and among subpopulations within the same population (N (m) = 3.53 to 48.37), indicating that few influence of temporal and spatial variations on population differentiation in this area. Similar result was obtained from 3ADON, 15ADON and NIV populations or carbendazim resistant and sensitive populations, indicating that chemotype of Fusarium isolates and carbendazim application had minor influence on population subdivision.

AB Stem rust has become a renewed threat to global wheat production after the emergence and spread of race TTKSK (also known as Ug99) and related races from Africa. To elucidate U. S. winter wheat resistance genes to stem rust, association mapping was conducted using a panel of 137 lines from cooperative U. S. winter wheat nurseries from 2008 and simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers across the wheat genome. Seedling infection types were evaluated in a greenhouse experiment using six U.S. stem rust races (QFCSC, QTHJC, RCRSC, RKQQC, TPMKC and TTTTF) and TTKSK, and adult plant responses to bulked U.S. races were evaluated in a field experiment. A linearization algorithm was used to convert the qualitative Stakman scale seedling infection types for quantitative analysis. Association mapping successfully detected six known stem rust seedling resistance genes in U. S. winter wheat lines with frequencies: Sr6 (12%), Sr24 (9%), Sr31 (15%), Sr36 (9%), Sr38 (19%), and Sr1RS(Amigo) (8%). Adult plant resistance gene Sr2 was present in 4% of lines. SrTmp was postulated to be present in several hard winter wheat lines, but the frequency could not be accurately determined. Sr38 was the most prevalent Sr gene in both hard and soft winter wheat and was the most effective Sr gene in the adult plant field test. Resistance to TTKSK was associated with nine markers on chromosome 2B that were in linkage disequilibrium and all of the resistance was attributed to the Triticum timopheevii chromosome segment carrying Sr36. Potential novel rust resistance alleles were associated with markers Xwmc326-203 on 3BL, Xgwm160-195 and Xwmc313-225 on 4AL near Sr7, Xgwm495-182 on 4BL, Xwmc622-147 and Xgwm624-146 on 4DL, and Xgwm334-123 on 6AS near Sr8. Xwmc326-203 was associated with adult plant resistance to bulked U. S. races and Xgwm495-182 was associated with seedling resistance to TTKSK.

AB Background: The understanding of sugarcane genetics has lagged behind that of other members of the Poaceae family such as wheat, rice, barley and sorghum mainly due to the complexity, size and polyploidization of the genome. We have used the genetic map of a sugarcane cultivar to generate a consensus genetic map to increase genome coverage for comparison to the sorghum genome. We have utilized the recently developed sugarcane DArT array to increase the marker density within the genetic map. The sequence of these DArT markers plus SNP and EST-SSR markers was then used to form a bridge to the sorghum genomic sequence by BLAST alignment to start to unravel the complex genomic architecture of sugarcane.
   Results: Comparative mapping revealed that certain sugarcane chromosomes show greater levels of synteny to sorghum than others. On a macrosyntenic level a good collinearity was observed between sugarcane and sorghum for 4 of the 8 homology groups (HGs). These 4 HGs were syntenic to four sorghum chromosomes with from 98% to 100% of these chromosomes covered by these linked markers. Four major chromosome rearrangements were identified between the other four sugarcane HGs and sorghum, two of which were condensations of chromosomes reducing the basic chromosome number of sugarcane from x = 10 to x = 8. This macro level of synteny was transferred to other members within the Poaceae family such as maize to uncover the important evolutionary relationships that exist between sugarcane and these species.
   Conclusions: Comparative mapping of sugarcane to the sorghum genome has revealed new information on the genome structure of sugarcane which will help guide identification of important genes for use in sugarcane breeding. Furthermore of the four major chromosome rearrangements identified in this study, three were common to maize providing some evidence that chromosome reduction from a common paleo-ancestor of both maize and sugarcane was driven by the same translocation events seen in both species.

AB An ordered draft sequence of the 17-gigabase hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome has been produced by sequencing isolated chromosome arms. We have annotated 124,201 gene loci distributed nearly evenly across the homeologous chromosomes and subgenomes. Comparative gene analysis of wheat subgenomes and extant diploid and tetraploid wheat relatives showed that high sequence similarity and structural conservation are retained, with limited gene loss, after polyploidization. However, across the genomes there was evidence of dynamic gene gain, loss, and duplication since the divergence of the wheat lineages. A high degree of transcriptional autonomy and no global dominance was found for the subgenomes. These insights into the genome biology of a polyploid crop provide a springboard for faster gene isolation, rapid genetic marker development, and precise breeding to meet the needs of increasing food demand worldwide.

AB Background: Grain yield in wheat is a polygenic trait that is influenced by environmental and genetic interactions at all stages of the plant's growth. Yield is usually broken down into three components; number of spikes per area, grain number per spike, and grain weight (TGW). In polyploid wheat, studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) which affect TGW, yet few have been validated and fine-mapped using independent germplasm, thereby having limited impact in breeding.
   Results: In this study we identified a major QTL for TGW, yield and green canopy duration on wheat chromosome 6A of the Spark x Rialto population, across 12 North European environments. Using independent germplasm in the form of BC2 and BC4 near isogenic lines (NILs), we validated the three QTL effects across environments. In four of the five experiments the Rialto 6A introgression gave significant improvements in yield (5.5%) and TGW (5.1%), with morphometric measurements showing that the increased grain weight was a result of wider grains. The extended green canopy duration associated with the high yielding/TGW Rialto allele was comprised of two independent effects; earlier flowering and delayed final maturity, and was expressed stably across the five environments. The wheat homologue (TaGW2) of a rice gene associated with increased TGW and grain width was mapped within the QTL interval. However, no polymorphisms were identified in the coding sequence between the parents.
   Conclusion: The discovery and validation through near-isogenic lines of robust QTL which affect yield, green canopy duration, thousand grain weight, and grain width on chromosome 6A of hexaploid wheat provide an important first step to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms regulating the complex processes governing grain size and yield in polyploid wheat.

AB Background: Tef (Eragrostis tef), an indigenous cereal critical to food security in the Horn of Africa, is rich in minerals and protein, resistant to many biotic and abiotic stresses and safe for diabetics as well as sufferers of immune reactions to wheat gluten. We present the genome of tef, the first species in the grass subfamily Chloridoideae and the first allotetraploid assembled de novo. We sequenced the tef genome for marker-assisted breeding, to shed light on the molecular mechanisms conferring tef's desirable nutritional and agronomic properties, and to make its genome publicly available as a community resource.
   Results: The draft genome contains 672 Mbp representing 87% of the genome size estimated from flow cytometry. We also sequenced two transcriptomes, one from a normalized RNA library and another from unnormalized RNASeq data. The normalized RNA library revealed around 38000 transcripts that were then annotated by the SwissProt group. The CoGe comparative genomics platform was used to compare the tef genome to other genomes, notably sorghum. Scaffolds comprising approximately half of the genome size were ordered by syntenic alignment to sorghum producing tef pseudo-chromosomes, which were sorted into A and B genomes as well as compared to the genetic map of tef. The draft genome was used to identify novel SSR markers, investigate target genes for abiotic stress resistance studies, and understand the evolution of the prolamin family of proteins that are responsible for the immune response to gluten.
   Conclusions: It is highly plausible that breeding targets previously identified in other cereal crops will also be valuable breeding targets in tef. The draft genome and transcriptome will be of great use for identifying these targets for genetic improvement of this orphan crop that is vital for feeding 50 million people in the Horn of Africa.

AB The wheat landraces collected by Dr Hitoshi Kihara et al. from Afghanistan, the place of secondary origin of wheat, are an untapped genetic resource for mining novel alleles. In this study, approximately 400 landraces were collected from seven agroecological zones and characterized using diversity array technology and single-nucleotide polymorphism markers, as well as diagnostic molecular markers at important loci controlling vernalization (Vrn), photoperiod response (Ppd), grain colour (R), leaf rust (Lr), yellow rust (Yr), stem rust (Sr) and Fusarium head blight (Fhb). A genome-wide marker array revealed a large amount of genetic diversity among the landraces, 53% of which were winter types, 43% were either spring types or facultative and 4% were either unknown or had Vrn-A1c - a rare spring allele that needs to be confirmed with additional genotyping and phenotyping. At Ppd, 97% of the lines carried a photosensitive allele. In the case of grain colour, classification based on dominant or recessive allelic combinations revealed that approximately 39% of the population is characterized by white grain. Four gene-specific markers that were targeted to identify loci for rust and Fhb resistance enabled us to identify 17 unique landraces with known resistance genes.

AB Identification of genetic determinants that define different degrees of line sensitivity to the photoperiod was acomplished using near-isogenic lines of the soft hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum L. using SSR markers and markers specific to the Vrn and Ppd genes. It was established that the Ppd-s line contains a dominant Ppd-D1a allele located on chromosome 2D. This allele is characterized by a large deletion in the gene promoter region. For two other lines (Ppd-m and Ppd-w), introgression of the Ppd-B1 gene on chromosome 2B was detected from the parental Sonora variety, which is insensitive to the day length; however, the previously described Ppd-B1a.1 allele was not found. Another polymorphism that can cause weak photoperiodic sensitivity, an increased copy number of the Ppd-B1 gene, was detected for these lines.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most important staple food crop for 35% of the world's population. International efforts are underway to facilitate an increase in wheat production, of which the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) plays an important role. As part of this effort, we have developed a sequence-based physical map of wheat chromosome 6A using whole-genome profiling (WGP (TM)). The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig assembly tools FINGERPRINTED CONTIG (FPC) and LINEAR TOPOLOGICAL CONTIG (LTC) were used and their contig assemblies were compared. A detailed investigation of the contigs structure revealed that LTC created a highly robust assembly compared with those formed by FPC. The LTC assemblies contained 1217 contigs for the short arm and 1113 contigs for the long arm, with an L-50 of 1 Mb. To facilitate in silico anchoring, WGP (TM) tags underlying BAC contigs were extended by wheat and wheat progenitor genome sequence information. Sequence data were used for in silico anchoring against genetic markers with known sequences, of which almost 79% of the physical map could be anchored. Moreover, the assigned sequence information led to the 'decoration' of the respective physical map with 3359 anchored genes. Thus, this robust and genetically anchored physical map will serve as a framework for the sequencing of wheat chromosome 6A, and is of immediate use for map-based isolation of agronomically important genes/quantitative trait loci located on this chromosome.

AB Stripe rust, also known as yellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikss. (Pst), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the United States and other parts of the world. To investigate the genetic basis of resistance conferred by the winter wheat cultivar 'TAM 111', a mapping population of 124 F-5 and F-6 derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the cross of 'TAM 112'/TAM 111 was evaluated against Pst populations in eight environments in the United States and against predominant race PST-100 in the greenhouse. The RIL population was further genotyped with Diversity Arrays Technology, simple sequence repeats and sequence tagged sites markers. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL), QYr.tam-2BL, was identified on the long arm of chromosome 2B, which is found to be associated with resistance to stripe rust in TAM 111. QYr.tam-2BL was identified in five out of the eight environments (Arkansas 2012, Arizona 2010, Castroville, TX, 2010, Mt. Vernon, WA, 2010 and Pullman, WA, 2011) as well as in the greenhouse, and explained 13 to 63% of the total phenotypic variation in severity across the environments. The QTL was also detected in seedling and adult plant stages with race PST-100 under controlled greenhouse conditions. Based on the available evidence, QYr.tam-2BL probably represents a previously uncharacterized gene on 2BL. Minor QTL on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 6B, and 7D were also detected inconsistently across environments. Because the effectiveness of QYr. tam-2BL was observed to be environmentally dependent and probably race-specific, it is suggested to combine this locus with effective major genes or adult plant resistance genes to increase its usefulness.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a major fungal disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Host plant resistance is a reliable, economical, and environmentally benign form of disease prevention. The identification of molecular markers linked with resistance genes can facilitate marker-assisted selection and enable breeders to pyramid several major genes for powdery mildew resistance in a single cultivar. The wheat germplasm line NC09BGTUM15 (NC-UM15) possesses the first powdery mildew resistance gene introgressed from Aegilops neglecta Req. ex Bertol. Greenhouse and field evaluations of F-2:3 families derived from a cross between NC-UM15 and the susceptible cultivar 'Saluda' indicated that a single dominant gene, temporarily designated MlUM15, conferred resistance to powdery mildew. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) showed that several simple sequence repeat (SSR), sequence tag site (STS), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers specific to chromosome 7AL segregated with the resistance gene. The most likely marker order was Xwmc525/ IWA8057-0.7 cM-Xcfa2257-0.4 cM-MlUM15 -0.8 cM-Xcfa2240-2.8 cM-Xmag2185-3.4cM-IWA2929-5.4 cM-IWA4434. The multiallelic Pm1 locus and several temporarily-designated genes map to this region of chromosome 7AL. Detached-leaf tests revealed that NC-UM15 had a different disease response pattern from genotypes carrying Pm37, five temporarily-designed genes in the region, and all alleles of the Pm1 complex except Pm1b. The MlUM15-resistance gene is most likely a novel source of powdery mildew resistance. However, allelism tests with Pm1 and further detached-leaf tests will be required to elucidate the relationship between MlUM15 and other Pm loci in the distal region of 7AL.

AB Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV) causes a serious viral disease affecting small grain crops around the world. In the United States, it frequently is present in California where it causes significant yield losses, and when infections start early in development, plant death. CYDV is transmitted by aphids, and it has been a major impediment to developing malting barley in California. To identify chromosome locations associated with tolerance/resistance to CYDV, a segregating population of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a cross of the California-adapted malting barley line Butta 12 with the CYDV-tolerant Madre Selva was used to construct a genetic map including 180 polymorphic markers mapping to 170 unique loci. Tolerance to CYDV was evaluated in replicated experiments where plants were challenged by aphid mediated inoculation with the isolate CYDV-RPV in a controlled environment. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed the presence of two major QTL for CYDV tolerance from Madre Selva on chromosomes 2H (Qcyd. MaBu-1) and 7H (Qcyd. MaBu-2), and 4 minor QTL from Butta 12 on chromosomes 3H, 4H, and 2H. This paper discusses the contribution of each QTL and its potential value to improve barley tolerance to CYDV.

AB The sequencing of individual chromosomes of common wheat is in progress. The molecular size of wheat chromosome 5B is nearly 870 Mb (5BL = 580 Mb and 5BS = 290 Mb). We produced the first low coverage 454-sequencing of the long and short arms of wheat chromosome 5B (110,793 and 39,695 reads, which compose 8 and 6% of total 5BL and 5BS length, respectively) and calculated the ratios of the different families of repetitive sequences, including transposable elements (TEs), satellite repeats (Afa, pSc119.2, 5S rDNA and 45S rDNA), and microsatellites, as well as direct and inverted repeat motifs. The TEs accounted for 70% of the total analyzed nucleotide sequences. The content of the Cereba retrotransposon family differed between the two arms of chromosome 5B. Comparing the reads of chromosome 5B with the data from chromosome 5A, we found the retrotransposons Fatima and Sakura and DNA transposon Jorge were prevalent in 5B. The hypothetical coding sequences accounted for 2.0% of the short arm and 2.07% of the long arm. Using in silico mapping, we identified the regions of synteny with rice and Brachypodium chromosomes (1,073,526 and 1,767,298 bp aligned, respectively), and the result was consistent with the data from the expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping of wheat 5B chromosome to the genomes of these grasses. Thus, these results show that low coverage survey sequencing can provide useful information about the composition and evolution of wheat chromosome 5B.

AB A set of 113 genotypes of barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare), along with the susceptible control genotype Gus, was tested for response to the barley leaf rust pathogen Puccinia hordei in the greenhouse (as seedlings) and field (as adult plants). The tests revealed that 68 lines carried adult plant resistance (APR), 23 lines carried uncharacterised seedling resistance (USR) and that three lines carried the seedling resistance gene Rph3. Nineteen lines lacked detectable seedling resistance and were also susceptible in the field at adult plant growth stages. The presence of marker bPb-0837, linked to the APR gene Rph20, in 35 of the 68 lines carrying APR, suggested they carry this gene. The remaining 33 lines, which lacked the Rph20 linked marker, are likely sources of new uncharacterised APR. Pedigree analysis of the 68 lines found to carry APR revealed that 32 were related to cv. Gull and to Hordeum laevigatum; two were related to cv. Bavaria and one related to cvv. Manchuria and Taganrog, suggesting that these genotypes may be the ancestral sources of the APR carried by each.

AB Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris) causes significant yield losses in chickpea worldwide. Faster, reliable and more specific molecular detection techniques were developed for the detection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc). The sequences obtained from multiple alignments of target genes, namely, translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF-1 alpha), beta-tubulin, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS), were used to design Foc-specific markers/probes. One set of TEF-1 alpha-based molecular marker, namely, SP alpha-F and R, two sets of beta-tubulin-based markers, namely, SP beta 1-F and R, and SP beta 2-F and R, and one set of ITS gene, namely, SPT-F and R, were developed for the detection and quantification of Foc from diverse samples. The specificity and sensitivity of the designed molecular markers were evaluated through conventional and real-time PCR assays which differentiated the Foc from closely related species of Fusarium and other plant pathogens. In conventional PCR, the minimum detection limits of the markers ranged from 12.5 pg to 100 pg for genomic DNA of Foc and 0.5 ng to 10 ng for infected plant samples. In real-time PCR assay, the minimum detection limits of the markers ranged from 0.001 pg to 0.25 pg for genomic DNA of Foc and from 0.04 pg to 1.5 pg for the infected plant samples. Thus, the markers designed in the present study were found to be specific for Foc and can be used consistently for the detection and identification of Foc isolates. The probes developed from the two sets of markers, namely, SP alpha and SP beta 2, also showed specificity with Foc.

AB Extensive application of imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides had a significant impact on barley productivity contributing to a continuous decline in its acreage over the last two decades. A possible solution to this problem is to transfer IMI-resistance from a recently characterized mutation in the 'Bob' barley AHAS (acetohydroxy acid synthase) gene to other food, feed and malting barley cultivars. We focused our efforts on transferring IMI-resistance to barley varieties adapted to the US Pacific Northwest (PNW), since it comprises similar to 23% (335,000 ha) of the US agricultural land under barley production. To effectively breed for IMI-resistance, we studied the genetic diversity among 13 two-rowed spring barley cultivars/breeding-lines from the PNW using 61 microsatellite markers, and selected six barley genotypes that showed medium to high genetic dissimilarity with the 'Bob' AHAS mutant. The six selected genotypes were used to make 29-53 crosses with the AHAS mutant and a range of 358-471 F-1 seeds were obtained. To make informed selection for the recovery of the recipient parent genome, the genetic location of the AHAS gene was determined and its genetic nature assessed. Large F-2 populations ranging in size from 2158-2846 individuals were evaluated for herbicide resistance and seedling vigor. Based on the results, F-3 lines from the six most vigorous F-2 genotypes per cross combination were evaluated for their genetic background. A range of 20%-90% recovery of the recipient parent genome for the carrier chromosome was observed. An effort was made to determine the critical dose of herbicide to distinguish between heterozygotes and homozygotes for the mutant allele. Results suggested that the mutant can survive up to the 10x field recommended dose of herbicide, and the 86x and 10x herbicide doses can distinguish between the two AHAS mutant genotypes. Finally, implications of this research in sustaining barley productivity in the PNW are discussed.

AB Aphids are sap-feeding plant pests and harbor the endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola, which is essential for their fecundity and survival. During plant penetration and feeding, aphids secrete saliva that contains proteins predicted to alter plant defenses and metabolism. Plants recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns and induce pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). No aphid-associated molecular pattern has yet been identified. By mass spectrometry, we identified in saliva from potato aphids (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) 105 proteins, some of which originated from Buchnera, including the chaperonin GroEL. Because GroEL is a widely conserved bacterial protein with an essential function, we tested its role in PTI. Applying or infiltrating GroEL onto Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves induced oxidative burst and expression of PTI early marker genes. These GroEL-induced defense responses required the known coreceptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1. In addition, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, inducible expression of groEL activated PTI marker gene expression. Moreover, Arabidopsis plants expressing groEL displayed reduced fecundity of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), indicating enhanced resistance against aphids. Furthermore, delivery of GroEL into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) or Arabidopsis through Pseudomonas fluorescens, engineered to express the type III secretion system, also reduced potato aphid and green peach aphid fecundity, respectively. Collectively our data indicate that GroEL is a molecular pattern that triggers PTI.

AB Abiotic stress experienced by autumn-sown crops during winter is of great economic importance as it can have a severe negative impact on yield. In this study, we investigated the genetic architecture of winter hardiness and frost tolerance in triticale. To this end, we used a large mapping population of 647 DH lines phenotyped for both traits in combination with genome-wide marker data. Employing multiple-line cross QTL mapping, we identified nine main effect QTL for winter hardiness and frost tolerance of which six were overlapping between both traits. Three major QTL were identified on chromosomes 5A, 1B and 5R. In addition, an epistasis scan revealed the contribution of epistasis to the genetic architecture of winter hardiness and frost tolerance in triticale. Taken together, our results show that winter hardiness and frost tolerance are complex traits that can be improved by phenotypic selection, but also that genomic approaches hold potential for a knowledge-based improvement of these important traits in elite triticale germplasm.

AB In previous studies, we developed a wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng disomic addition line 3-8-10-2, which exhibited high stripe rust resistance and could be used as a donor source for introducing novel disease resistance gene(s) into wheat in future breeding programs. It was identified using cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), EST-SSR, EST-STS and morphological analyses. However, these techniques are not suitable for breeding programs that require the rapid screening of large numbers of genotypes because they are highly technical and time-consuming. In this study, three Ns genome-specific SCAR markers were developed via random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. These SCAR markers were further validated using a complete set of wheat-P. huashanica disomic addition lines, which segregated the 5Ns disomic addition line individuals. Our results indicated that the SCAR markers associated with the 5Ns chromosome of P. huashanica and they provide a low cost, high efficiency, alternative tool for screening 5Ns chromosomes in a wheat background. These newly developed SCAR markers that species-specificity of the markers was proved by analysis of a wide range of cereal species, and specific for 5Ns chromosome, which should be useful in marker-assisted selection for wheat breeders who want to screen genotypes that may contain 5Ns chromatin.

AB Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a crop of substantial international significance for both food and fuel, however its highly polyploid nature challenges investigation of its genetic composition. Efforts to generate the full sugarcane genome sequence are underway, however in the meantime crop improvement efforts are somewhat limited by the lack of genome sequence resources available for physiological characterization. Low-coverage survey sequence data was generated and assembled for six sugarcane genotypes representing a range of significant S. spontaneum, S. officinarum, and S. hybrid cultivar accessions from around the world. These data were explored to investigate the composition of repetitive sequences and variations in chloroplast genome sequence, as well as assembled into a conglomerate monoploid genome sequence for polymorphism comparison between the genotypes. Almost half (47 %) of the inter-genomic polymorphisms analysed in these data represented poly-allelic variations which cannot be applied in traditional present/absent marker analysis, suggesting that new approaches are required to better understand and access genetic diversity within the Saccharum genus. These results support previous assertions that S. spontaneum is both less repetitive (62 % repetitive k-mers in Mandalay vs. 65 % in IJ76-514) and more highly polymorphic (17 % poly-alleles in Mandalay vs. 10 % poly-alleles in IJ76-514) than S. officinarum, with S. hybrids being intermediate between the two. However, contrary to previous analysis the monoploid genome size of S. spontaneum does not appear to differ significantly from that of S. officinarum as had been expected. This genomic survey assembly will be a very useful resource for sugarcane genomics in the absence of a monoploid or polyploid genome sequence, and will be made available upon request.

AB Pheromone traps have been widely used to monitor insect population activity. However, sticky pheromone traps for the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), one of the most destructive pests of wheat, have been used only in recent years. Hessian fly male adults are small and fragile, and preserving specimens during sorting of sticky pheromone traps is a challenge when intact specimens are often required to visually distinguish them from related insects such as fungus gnats. In this study, we have established a quick and reliable method based on polymerase chain reaction markers to correctly distinguish Hessian fly males from other closely related insects. Two Hessian fly-specific markers were established, one based on the trypsin gene MDP-10 and the other based on a gene encoding the salivary gland protein SSGP31D-5. Both markers provided >98% identification success of 110 Hessian fly samples prepared from single insects. The method should provide a useful tool to allow for identification of Hessian fly individuals on sticky pheromone traps or in other situations when Hessian fly eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults are difficult to distinguish from other insects.

AB Being an excellent source of calcium, finger millet crop has nutraceutical importance. Mineral accumulation, being a polygenic trait, becomes essential to target potential candidate genes directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of calcium transport and signaling in cereals and might have influence on grain calcium accumulation. In view of this, genic microsatellite markers were developed from the coding and non-coding sequences of calcium signaling and transport genes viz. calcium transporters (channels; ATPases and antiporters), calcium-binding proteins and calcium-regulated protein kinases available in rice and sorghum. In total, 146 genic "simple sequence repeat" (SSR) primers were designed and evaluated for cross-transferability across a panel of nine grass species including finger millet. The average transferability of genic SSR markers from sorghum to other grasses was highest (73.2 %) followed by rice (63.4 %) with an overall average of 68.3 % which establishes the importance of these major crops as a useful resource of genomic information for minor crops. The transfer rate of SSR markers was also correlated with the phylogenetic relationship (or genetic relatedness) of the species. Primers with successful amplification in finger millet were further used to screen for polymorphism across a set of high and low calcium containing genotypes. The results reveal a conserved behavior across the finger millet genotypes indicating that the mineral transport and the storage machinery largely remain conserved in plants and even SSR variations in them remain suppressed during the course of evolution. Single nucleotide polymorphism and differential expression patterns of candidate genes, therefore, might be a plausible reason to explain variations in grain calcium contents among finger millet genotypes.

AB Drought is a severe abiotic stress that affects wheat production worldwide. In order to identify candidate genes for tolerance to water stress in wheat, sequences of 11 genes that have function of drought tolerance in other plant species were used to identify the wheat ortholog genes via homology searching in the wheat EST database. A total of 11 primer pairs were identified and amplified PCR products in wheat. Of them, 10 STS markers were mapped on 11 chromosomes in a set of nulli-tetrasomic lines of 'Chinese Spring' wheat; six were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 4B, 7A, 2B and 5D, respectively, in a spring wheat mapping population (POP1). The marker XTaABH1 mapped on 7A in POP1 was the only one mapped but characterized in a winter wheat mapping population (POP2) for grain yield, kernel weight and diameter, and height in four-field trials applied different water stress or irrigation. The marker XTaABH1 was significantly associated with grain yield under rainfed condition, with kernel weight under terminal stress and non-irrigation conditions, with kernel diameter and height under non-irrigated condition. The STS primers, map information and marker-trait association produced in the currently study would be of interest to researchers working on drought tolerance.

AB Diploid wheat T. monococcum L. is a model plant for wheat functional genomics. A soft glume mutant was identified during manual screening of EMS-treated M-2 progenies of a T. monococcum accession pau14087. The seeds in the mature spike of the mutant could be easily threshed manually. The soft glume mutant with high sterility, tapering and broader spikes had also tougher rachis than the wild type parent. Genetic analysis of crosses of the mutant with wild type indicated that the mutant was monogenic recessive. To map the soft glume mutant, a mapping population was developed by crossing the soft glume mutant with wild Triticum boeoticum acc. pau 5088, having tough glumes and hard threshing. The soft glume mutant was mapped between SSR markers Xgwm473 and Xbarc69 on 7A(m)L chromosome of T. monococcum, with a genetic distance of 1.8 cM and 8.3 cM, respectively. The soft glume mutant mapped on 7A(m)L, being distinct from a previously mapped soft glume mutant in wheat, has been designated as sog2. The work on fine mapping of sog2 gene is in progress.

AB Nearly twenty thousand wheat lines were phenotyped for the presence of leaf tip necrosis (LTN), a phenotypic trait linked to adult plant leaf rust resistance (APR) genes, viz. Lr34, Lr46 and Lr67 having pleiotropic association with multiple disease resistance genes. Thirty-six lines showed varied expression of LTN and moderate level of leaf rust severity at adult plant stage with slow rusting (disease progress at a retarded rate). Seedling resistance test (SRT) revealed susceptible and mixed infection types, a characteristic of adult plant resistance (APR) genes. Further molecular confirmation for the presence of these genes using available microsatellite markers revealed that of the 36 lines, five lines carried Lr46+ alone and five other lines carried Lr67+ alone. Seven lines carried the combination of Lr34+ and Lr67+ while six lines confirmed to carry the combination of Lr46+ and Lr67+. Remarkably three lines carried all the three APR genes, viz. Lr34+, Lr46+ and Lr67+. All these stocks can be a source of APR multiple disease resistance genes. Ten lines were not confirmed to carry any of the genes but still had LTN and SRT results showing an infection type typical of APR genes and these can be the source of identifying newer APR genes. The resistance based on minor APR genes when combined with a few additional minor genes in the background of high yielding cultivars is expected to have high level of race non-specific resistance and to be durable.

AB A whole genome average interval mapping approach identified eight QTL associated with P. thornei resistance in a DH population from a cross between the synthetic-derived wheat Sokoll and cultivar Krichauff.
   Pratylenchus thornei are migratory nematodes that feed and reproduce within the wheat root cortex, causing cell death (lesions) resulting in severe yield reductions globally. Genotypic selection using molecular markers closely linked to Pratylenchus resistance genes will accelerate the development of new resistant cultivars by reducing the need for laborious and expensive resistance phenotyping. A doubled haploid wheat population (150 lines) from a cross between the synthetic-derived cultivar Sokoll (P. thornei resistant) and cultivar Krichauff (P. thornei moderately susceptible) was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with P. thornei resistance. The resistance identified in the glasshouse was validated in a field trial. A genetic map was constructed using Diversity Array Technology and the QTL regions identified were further targeted with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Six significant and two suggestive P. thornei resistance QTL were detected using a whole genome average interval mapping approach. Three QTL were identified on chromosome 2B, two on chromosome 6D, and a single QTL on each of chromosomes 2A, 2D and 5D. The QTL on chromosomes 2BS and 6DS mapped to locations previously identified to be associated with Pratylenchus resistance. Together, the QTL on 2B (QRlnt.sk-2B.1-2B.3) and 6D (QRlnt.sk-6D.1 and 6D.2) explained 30 and 48 % of the genotypic variation, respectively. Flanking PCR-based markers based on SSRs and SNPs were developed for the major QTL on 2B and 6D and provide a cost-effective high-throughput tool for marker-assisted breeding of wheat with improved P. thornei resistance.

AB This manuscript reports a new gene (Yr62) and a small-effect QTL for potentially durable resistance to stripe rust and usefulness of Yr62 markers for marker-assisted selection.
   Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. Spring wheat germplasm PI 192252 showed a high level of high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust in germplasm evaluation over 8 years in the State of Washington. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, PI 192252 was crossed with 'Avocet susceptible'. A mapping population of 150 F-5 recombinant inbred lines was developed using single-seed descent. Stripe rust tests were conducted with selected Pst races in a greenhouse and in field conditions under natural infections. The relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC) data showed continuous distributions, indicating that HTAP resistance of PI 192252 was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). Two QTL were identified in PI 192252, explaining 74.2 % of the total phenotypic variation for rAUDPC. These two QTL were mapped to chromosomes 4BL (QYrPI192252.wgp-4BL) and 5BS (QYrPI192252.wgp-5BS) with SSR and SNP markers and explained 40-60 and 22-27 %, respectively, of the phenotypic variation across the four environments. Because the major-effect QTL on 4BL is different from previously named Yr genes and inherited as a single gene, it is named Yr62. The SSR marker alleles Xgwm192 (222) and Xgwm251 (133) flanking Yr62 were different from the alleles in various wheat varieties, suggesting that these markers could be useful in marker-assisted selection for incorporating Yr62 into commercial cultivars.

AB BACKGROUNDPeroxidase, a plant-specific oxidoreductase, is a heme-containing glycoprotein encoded by a large multigenic family in plants. Plant peroxidases (POXs, EC 1.11.1.7) play important roles in many self-defense interactions in plants. Here, 67 common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes were studied using a POX gene-based marker method. Comparison of POX genes could resolve evolutionary relationships in common bean.
   RESULTSEighty fragments were obtained with 20 primer pairs that amplified one (POX8c) to eight (ATP29) bands, with a mean of four bands per primer pair. The average (polymorphic information content) PIC value for the POX products was 0.40. The maximum variation (93%) was found between Turkey (#33) and India (#52) and between Antalya (#33) and India (#53). The minimum variation (0%) was found among four pairs: Bozdag (#2) and Karadeniz (#38), Kirklareli (#11) and Turkey (#15, 16, 43), Bandirma (#13) and Turkey (#15, 16, 43), and Kirklareli (#10) and Bandirma (#22). UPGMA was used to discriminate the common bean genotypes into five clusters, while STRUCTURE software was used to investigate the genetic population structure.
   CONCLUSIONThe results showed that POX gene family markers can be used to study genotypic diversity and provide new information for breeding programs and common bean improvement practices. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) contributes substantially to global food and nutritional security. Thus, an important goal of wheat breeding is to develop high-yielding varieties with better nutritional quality and resistance to all major diseases. During the present study, in the background of a popular elite wheat cultivar PBW343, we pyramided eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs)/genes for four grain quality traits (high grain weight, high grain protein content, pre-harvest sprouting tolerance, and desirable high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits) and resistance against the three rusts. For pyramiding eight QTLs/genes, four improved PBW343 lines, each carrying different combinations of the desired QTLs/genes (developed by us earlier), were crossed in pairs to produce two single-cross F-1 hybrids. The single-cross F-1 hybrids were intercrossed to produce a double-cross hybrid (DCH). Using marker-assisted selection in five consecutive generations (DCHF1-DCHF5), four pyramided lines (PYLs) were selected, each with all the eight desired QTLs/genes in homozygous state. The phenotypic characterization of the progenies of these PYLs suggested that the genetic background of PBW343 was retained in all these four PYLs. Therefore, these PYLs should prove useful in future wheat breeding programs for improving not only the grain quality, but also the durability of resistance against all three rusts. Multi-year/multi-location trials are planned for these pyramided lines to evaluate their potential for release as a next-generation improved version of wheat cv. PBW343 for commercial cultivation.

AB Identification of marker-trait associations is the first step towards marker-assisted selection in plant breeding. Here we assess genetic diversity and population structure of 94 diverse wheat elite lines and use genome-wide association mapping to identify marker-trait associations for five important traits: kernel hardness (KHA), thousand-kernel weight, grain protein content, test weight (TWT), and plant height (PHT). The 94 accessions employed in this study were grouped into three subpopulations based on the first three principal components, which accounted for 51.5 % of the variations. A mixed linear model was used to detect marker-trait associations incorporating covariance of population structure and relative kinship. A total of six marker loci was significantly associated with KHA, TWT, and PHT after the correction of false discovery rate (alpha (c) = 0.05). The gene pinB was found to be highly associated with KHA, and is reported to be a major determinant of KHA together with the gene pinA at the Ha locus on chromosome 5D. Marker XwPt-7187 on chromosome 2A was also significantly associated with KHA, two Diversity Arrays Technology markers XwPt-1250 and XwPt-4628 with TWT, and marker Xgwm512 with PHT, making the first report of marker-trait associations in these genomic regions.

AB In the process (BC3F1 generation) of backcrossing an Avena isolate of Pyricularia oryzae with a Triticum isolate, color mutants with white mycelia were obtained. These white mutants lacked virulence on all (31/31) hexaploid and most (28/32) tetraploid wheat lines tested. In a BC4F1 population, white and black cultures segregated in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that the mutant phenotype is controlled by a single gene. Furthermore, the mycelial color was perfectly linked with avirulence in the BC4F1 population; white cultures were all avirulent on common wheat (Triticum aestivum) 'Norin 4' (N4) whereas black cultures were all virulent. White cultures in the BC3F1 and BC4F1 generations were also avirulent on tetraploid wheat (T dicoccoides) accession 'KU109' (Tat4), which was susceptible to all cultures derived from the parental wild isolates through the BC2F1 generation. A cross between Tat4 and a susceptible tetraploid (T paleocolchicum) accession 'KU196' (Tat14) produced resistant and susceptible F-2 seedlings in a 3:1 ratio against the white cultures. In the F-3 generation homozygous resistant/segregating/homozygous susceptible lines segregated in a 1:2:1 ratio. These results suggest that the resistance of Tat4 to the white cultures is controlled by a single major gene. This gene, tentatively designated as RmgTd(t), is considered to be a hidden resistance gene because it was not detected with the Br58, F-1, BC1F1, or BC2F1 cultures. Cytological analysis revealed that the moderate resistance controlled by RmgTd(t) was associated with a hypersensitive reaction of mesophyll cells.

AB Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), a yield- and quality-reducing disease of wheat. S. nodorum produces a set of necrotrophic effectors (NEs) that interact with the products of host sensitivity genes to cause cell death and increased susceptibility to disease. The focus of this study was determination of NE sensitivity among 25 winter wheat cultivars, many of them from the southeastern United States, that are susceptible to SNB, as well as the moderately resistant 'NC-Neuse'. Thirty-three isolates of S. nodorum previously collected from seven southeastern U.S. states were cultured for NE production, and the culture filtrates were used in an infiltration bioassay. Control strains of Pichia pastoris that expressed SnToxA, Snrox1, or SnTox3 were also used. All SNB-susceptible cultivars were sensitive to at least one NE, while NC-Neuse was insensitive to all NEs tested. Among the sensitive lines, 32% contained sensitivity gene Tsn1 and 64% contained sensitivity gene Snn3. None were sensitive to SnTox1. Additionally, 10 molecular markers for sensitivity genes Tsn1, Snn1, Snn2, and Snn3 were evaluated for diagnostic potential. Only the marker Xfcp623 for Tsn1 was diagnostic, and it was in perfect agreement with the results of the infiltration bioassays. The results illuminate which NE sensitivity genes may be of concern in breeding for resistance to SNB in the southeastern United States.

AB Lactobacillus (L) brevis is one of the most frequently encountered bacteria in beer-spoilage incidents. As the species Lactobacillus brevis comprises strains showing varying ability to grow in beer, ranging from growth in low hopped wheat to highly hopped pilsner beer, differentiation and classification of L. brevis with regard to their beer-spoiling ability is of vital interest for the brewing industry.
   Matrix-Assisted-Laser-Desorption-lonization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been shown as a powerful tool for species and sub-species differentiation of bacterial isolates and is increasingly used for strain-level differentiation.
   Seventeen L. brevis strains, representative of different spoilage types, were characterized according to their tolerance to iso-alpha-acids and their growth in wheat-, lager- and pilsner beer. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were acquired to perform strain-level identification, cluster analysis and biomarker detection.
   Strain-level identification was achieved in 90% out of 204 spectra. Misidentification occurred nearly exclusively among strains belonging to the same spoilage type. Though spectra of strongly beer-spoiling strains showed remarkable similarity, no decisive single markers were detected to be present in all strains of one group. However, MALDI-TOF MS spectra can be reliably assigned to the corresponding strain and thus allow to track single strains and connect them to their physiological properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for heading date (HD) was performed with a panel of 358 European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties through the phenotypic evaluation of HD in field tests in eight environments. Genotyping data consisted of 770 mapped microsatellite loci and 7934 mapped SNP markers derived from the 90K iSelect wheat chip. Best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) were calculated across all trials and ranged from 142.5 to 159.6 days after the 1st of January with an average value of 151.4 days. Considering only associations with a -log(10) (P-value) >= 3.0, a total of 340 SSR and 2983 SNP marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, a total of 72 SSR and 438 SNP marker-trait associations remained significant. Highly significant MTAs were detected for the photoperiodism gene Ppd-D1, which was genotyped in all varieties. Consistent associations were found on all chromosomes with the highest number of MTAs on chromosome 5B. Linear regression showed a clear dependence of the HD score BLUEs on the number of favorable alleles (decreasing HD) and unfavorable alleles (increasing HD) per variety meaning that genotypes with a higher number of favorable or a low number of unfavorable alleles showed lower HD and therefore flowered earlier. For the vernalization gene Vrn-A2 co-locating MTAs on chromosome 5A, as well as for the photoperiodism genes Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 on chromosomes 2A and 2B were detected. After the construction of an integrated map of the SSR and SNP markers and by exploiting the synteny to sequenced species, such as rice and Brachypodium distachyon, we were able to demonstrate that a marker locus on wheat chromosome 5BL with homology to the rice photoperiodism gene Hd6 played a significant role in the determination of the heading date in wheat.

AB Background: Triticum monococcum (2n) is a close ancestor of T. urartu, the A-genome progenitor of cultivated hexaploid wheat, and is therefore a useful model for the study of components regulating photomorphogenesis in diploid wheat. In order to develop genetic and genomic resources for such a study, we constructed genome-wide transcriptomes of two Triticum monococcum subspecies, the wild winter wheat T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides (accession G3116) and the domesticated spring wheat T. monococcum ssp. monococcum (accession DV92) by generating de novo assemblies of RNA-Seq data derived from both etiolated and green seedlings.
   Principal Findings: The de novo transcriptome assemblies of DV92 and G3116 represent 120,911 and 117,969 transcripts, respectively. We successfully mapped similar to 90% of these transcripts from each accession to barley and similar to 95% of the transcripts to T. urartu genomes. However, only similar to 77% transcripts mapped to the annotated barley genes and similar to 85% transcripts mapped to the annotated T. urartu genes. Differential gene expression analyses revealed 22% more light up-regulated and 35% more light down-regulated transcripts in the G3116 transcriptome compared to DV92. The DV92 and G3116 mRNA sequence reads aligned against the reference barley genome led to the identification of similar to 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and similar to 22,000 simple sequence repeat (SSR) sites.
   Conclusions: De novo transcriptome assemblies of two accessions of the diploid wheat T. monococcum provide new empirical transcriptome references for improving Triticeae genome annotations, and insights into transcriptional programming during photomorphogenesis. The SNP and SSR sites identified in our analysis provide additional resources for the development of molecular markers.

AB Background: Grain size and shape greatly influence grain weight which ultimately enhances grain yield in wheat. Digital imaging (DI) based phenomic characterization can capture the three dimensional variation in grain size and shape than has hitherto been possible. In this study, we report the results from using digital imaging of grain size and shape to understand the relationship among different components of this trait, their contribution to enhance grain weight, and to identify genomic regions (QTLs) controlling grain morphology using genome wide association mapping with high density diversity array technology (DArT) and allele-specific markers.
   Results: Significant positive correlations were observed between grain weight and grain size measurements such as grain length (r = 0.43), width, thickness (r = 0.64) and factor from density (FFD) (r = 0.69). A total of 231 synthetic hexaploid wheats (SHWs) were grouped into five different sub-clusters by Bayesian structure analysis using unlinked DArT markers. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay was observed among DArT loci > 10 cM distance and approximately 28% marker pairs were in significant LD. In total, 197 loci over 60 chromosomal regions and 79 loci over 31 chromosomal regions were associated with grain morphology by genome wide analysis using general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) approaches, respectively. They were mainly distributed on homoeologous group 2, 3, 6 and 7 chromosomes. Twenty eight marker-trait associations (MTAs) on the D genome chromosomes 2D, 3D and 6D may carry novel alleles with potential to enhance grain weight due to the use of untapped wild accessions of Aegilops tauschii. Statistical simulations showed that favorable alleles for thousand kernel weight (TKW), grain length, width and thickness have additive genetic effects. Allelic variations for known genes controlling grain size and weight, viz. TaCwi-2A, TaSus-2B, TaCKX6-3D and TaGw2-6A, were also associated with TKW, grain width and thickness. In silico functional analysis predicted a range of biological functions for 32 DArT loci and receptor like kinase, known to affect plant development, appeared to be common protein family encoded by several loci responsible for grain size and shape.
   Conclusion: Conclusively, we demonstrated the application and integration of multiple approaches including high throughput phenotyping using DI, genome wide association studies (GWAS) and in silico functional analysis of candidate loci to analyze target traits, and identify candidate genomic regions underlying these traits. These approaches provided great opportunity to understand the breeding value of SHWs for improving grain weight and enhanced our deep understanding on molecular genetics of grain weight in wheat.

AB Completion of sequencing of the Plasmodium vivax genome and transcriptome offers the chance to identify antigens among > 5000 candidate proteins. To identify those P. vivax proteins that are immunogenic, a total of 152 candidate proteins (160 fragments) were expressed using a wheat germ cell-free system. The results of Western blot analysis showed that 92.5% (148/160) of the targets were expressed, and 96.6% (143/148) were in a soluble form with 67.7% of solubility rate. The proteins were screened by protein arrays with sera from 22 vivax malaria patients and 10 healthy individuals to confirm their immune profile, and 44 (27.5%, 44/160) highly reactive P. vivax antigens were identified. Overall, 5 candidates (rhoptry-associated membrane antigen [RAMA], Pv-fam-a and -b, EXP-1 and hypothetical protein PVX_084775) showed a positive reaction with > 80% of patient sera, and 21 candidates with 50% to 80%. More than 23% of the highly immunoreactive proteins were hypothetical proteins, described for the first time in this study. One of the top immunogenic proteins, RAMA, was characterized and confirmed to be a serological marker of recent exposure to P. vivax infection. These novel immunoproteomes should greatly facilitate the identification of promising novel malaria antigens and may warrant further study.
   Biological significance
   The establishment of high-throughput cloning and expression systems has permitted the construction of protein arrays for proteome-wide study of Plasmodium vivax. In this study,high-throughput screening assays have been applied to investigate blood stage-specific immune proteomes from P. vivax. We identified 44 antigenic proteins from the 152 putative candidates, more than 23% of which were hypothetical proteins described for the first time in this study. In addition, PvRAMA was characterized further and confirmed to be a serological marker of exposure to infections. The expression of one-third of the selected antigenic genes were shifted between P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting that these genes may represent important factors associated with P. vivax selectivity for young erythrocytes and/or with immune evasion. These novel immune proteomes of the P. vivax blood stage provide a baseline for further prospective serological marker studies in malaria. These methods could be used to determine immunodominant candidate antigens from the P. vivax genome. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID IMAZAMOX
AB 'SY Clearstone 2CL' (Reg. No. CV-1094, PI 668090) hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed by the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station and released in September 2012 through a marketing agreement with Syngenta Seeds. SY Clearstone 2CL is a two-gene Clearfield backcross-derivative of 'Yellowstone' (PI 643428) hard red winter wheat with resistance to imazamox herbicide Beyond (BASF Corporation). SY Clearstone 2CL was selected from the cross Yellowstone*4/3/MTCL01158/Teal 11A//'Jagalene' (PI 631376). Yellowstone is a high-yielding hard red winter wheat released by the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station in 2006. MTCL01158 is an unreleased doubled haploid breeding line [TX12588*4/FS2//Tiber (PI 517194)], which served as the source of proprietary mutant allele TaAHASL1D. Proprietary hard red spring wheat germplasm line Teal 11A (BASF Corporation) served as the source of mutant gene TaAHASL1B. Alleles for herbicide resistance were selected during the backcross process using single-nucleotide, allele-specific polymerase chain reaction markers for TaAHASL1D and TaAHASL1B developed by BASF. SY Clearstone 2CL was selected as an F-2:4 line in 2009 following three generations of screening of the backcross population with imazamox herbicide. Results of three years of replicated field testing indicate that SY Clearstone 2CL is similar to recurrent parent Yellowstone for grain yield, most agronomic characteristics, and milling and baking qualities.

AB The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor [Say]) is a major yield-limiting pest in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production systems. Resistant varieties provide the most effective control method. The objectives of this study were to identify the chromosomal location of and molecular markers associated with the Hessian fly resistance from the spring wheat cultivar 'Louise'. One hundred eighty-eight F-5:6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a Louise (resistant) x 'Penawawa' (susceptible) cross were evaluated for resistance to Hessian fly biotype C and a mixed population originating from field collections in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Eight to 15 plants per RIL were scored for resistance at Purdue University and the University of Idaho. Data were converted to percentages of susceptible plants within each RIL. Louise and Penawawa had averaged susceptibility values of 15 and 100%, respectively. The RIL population ranged from 0 to 100% susceptible. A genetic linkage map consisting of 320 simple sequence repeat and 8530 single nucleotide polymorphism DNA markers was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. One QTL, identified as QHf.wak-1A, was significantly associated with Hessian fly resistance at an average LOD of 26.2 and accounted for 77% of the phenotypic variation. QHf.wak-1A was localized to a 4.6-cM region on chromosome 1AS, flanked by markers Xiwb70039 and Xcfd15. Marker, biotype screening, and allelism results indicate that this QTL is different from H9, H11, H5, and H3, but linked to H3 and H5. These data continue to clarify the relationship between Hessian fly genes on chromosome 1AS and would facilitate breeding efforts.

AB Freezing tolerance is an essential trait for winter wheat cultivars. A genetic analysis of a Brundage x Coda winter wheat recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population was undertaken to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with freezing tolerance. Five-week to 6-wk old, cold-acclimated plants were frozen to -10.5, -11.5, or -12.5 degrees C. The standardized mean percentage survival of all RILs within each temperature was 61, 44, and 28%, respectively. A total of 2391 polymorphic DNA markers including 1984 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 232 Diversity Array Technology (DArT), and 175 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to create a genome-wide genetic linkage map. The QTL analysis identified six QTL that were associated with freezing tolerance at either a specific temperature or a combination of temperatures. The QTL QFrbr.wak-5A was associated with freezing tolerance at all temperatures tested and was on chromosome 5AL. Further marker analysis indicates that this QTL is not an effect of known sequence polymorphisms at Vrn-A1. On the basis of map homology, QFrbr.wak-5A mapped at or near the CBF (cold binding factor) gene cluster at Fr-A2, but not an effect of TaCBF-A15, TaCBF-A14, or TaCBF-A12. Other QTL were located on chromosomes 2A, 3A, 5B, and 6D, and were significant at only specific temperatures. Identification of QTL associated with freezing tolerance may lead to useful genetic markers for marker-assisted selection, allowing for more efficient development of freezing tolerant cultivars. Additional studies of this QTL will further enhance knowledge of cold tolerance in wheat, as this QTL is not due to known sequence variation at Vrn-A1 or tested CBF genes.

AB Key message Using association and linkage mapping, two SNP markers closely linked to the SBWMV resistance gene on chromosome 5D were identified and can be used to select the gene in breeding.
   Abstract Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) disease is a serious viral disease of winter wheat growing areas worldwide. SBWMV infection can significantly reduce grain yield up to 80 %. Developing resistant wheat cultivars is the only feasible strategy to reduce the losses. In this study, wheat Infinium iSelect Beadchips with 9 K wheat SNPs were used to genotype an association mapping population of 205 wheat accessions. Six new SNPs from two genes were identified to be significantly associated with the gene for SBWMV resistance on chromosome 5D. The SNPs and Xgwm469, an SSR marker that has been reported to be associated with the gene, were mapped close to the gene using F6-derived recombinant inbred lines from the cross between a resistant parent 'Heyne' and a susceptible parent 'Trego'. Two representative SNPs, wsnp_CAP11_c209_198467 and wsnp_JD_c4438_5568170, from the two linked genes in wheat were converted into KBioscience Competitive Allele-Specific Polymerase assays and can be easily used in marker-assisted selection to improve wheat resistance to SBWMV in breeding.

AB Key message Chromosomes 5A(u), 5S and 5D can be isolated from wild progenitors, providing a chromosome-based approach to develop tools for breeding and to study the genome evolution of wheat.
   Abstract The three subgenomes of hexaploid bread wheat originated from Triticum urartu (A(u)A(u)), from a species similar to Aegilops speltoides (SS) (progenitor of the B genome), and from Ae. tauschii (DD). Earlier studies indicated the potential of chromosome genomics to assist gene transfer from wild relatives of wheat and discover novel genes for wheat improvement. This study evaluates the potential of flow cytometric chromosome sorting in the diploid progenitors of bread wheat. Flow karyotypes obtained by analysing DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and the contents of the chromosome peaks were determined. FISH analysis with repetitive DNA probes proved that chromosomes 5A(u), 5S and 5D could be sorted with purities of 78-90 %, while the remaining chromosomes could be sorted in groups of three. Twenty-five conserved orthologous set (COS) markers covering wheat homoeologous chromosome groups 1-7 were used for PCR with DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA. These assays validated the cytomolecular results as follows: peak I on flow karyotypes contained chromosome groups 1, 4 and 6, peak II represented homoeologous group 5, while peak III consisted of groups 2, 3 and 7. The isolation of individual chromosomes of wild progenitors provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the structure and evolution of the polyploid genome and to deliver tools for wheat improvement.

AB Key message Fine mapping permits the precise positioning of genes within chromosomes, prerequisite for positional cloning that will allow its rational use and the study of the underlying molecular action mechanism.
   Abstract Three leaf rust resistance genes were identified in the durable leaf rust resistant Argentinean wheat variety Sinvalocho MA: the seedling resistance gene Lr3 on distal 6BL and two adult plant resistance genes, LrSV1 and LrSV2, on chromosomes 2DS and 3BS, respectively. To develop a high-resolution genetic map for LrSV2, 10 markers were genotyped on 343 F2 individuals from a cross between Sinvalocho MA and Gama6. The closest co-dominant markers on both sides of the gene (3 microsatellites and 2 STMs) were analyzed on 965 additional F2s from the same cross. Microsatellite marker cfb5010 cosegregated with LrSV2 whereas flanking markers were found at 1 cM distal and at 0.3 cM proximal to the gene. SSR markers designed from the sequences of cv Chinese Spring BAC clones spanning the LrSV2 genetic interval were tested on the recombinants, allowing the identification of microsatellite swm13 at 0.15 cM distal to LrSV2. This delimited an interval of 0.45 cM around the gene flanked by the SSR markers swm13 and gwm533 at the subtelomeric end of chromosome 3BS.

AB The genetics of resistance to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. avenae of four cultivated oats was studied using monosomic analysis. Cultivar 'Bruno' carries a gene (Pm6) that shows a recessive mode of inheritance and is located on chromosome 10D. Cultivar 'Jumbo' possesses a dominant resistance gene (Pm1) on chromosome 1C. In cultivar 'Rollo', in addition to the gene Pm3 on chromosome 17A, a second dominant resistance gene (Pm8) was identified and assigned to chromosome 4C. In breeding line APR 122, resistance was conditioned by a dominant resistance gene (Pm7) that was allocated to chromosome 13A. Genetic maps established for resistance genes Pm1, Pm6 and Pm7 employing amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers indicated that these genes are independent of each other, supporting the results from monosomic analysis.

AB Abscisic acid is an essential hormone for seed dormancy. Our previous study using the plant gene switch system, a chemically induced gene expression system, demonstrated that induction of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), a rate-limiting ABA biosynthesis gene, was sufficient to suppress germination in imbibed Arabidopsis seeds. Here, we report development of an efficient experimental system that causes amplification of NCED expression during seed maturation. The system was created with a Triticum aestivum promoter containing ABA responsive elements (ABREs) and a Sorghum bicolor NCED to cause ABA-stimulated ABA biosynthesis and signaling, through a positive feedback mechanism. The chimeric gene pABRE:NCED enhanced NCED and ABF (ABRE-binding factor) expression in Arabidopsis Columbia-0 seeds, which caused 9- to 73-fold increases in ABA levels. The pABRE:NCED seeds exhibited unusually deep dormancy which lasted for more than 3months. Interestingly, the amplified ABA pathways also caused enhanced expression of Arabidopsis NCED5, revealing the presence of positive feedback in the native system. These results demonstrated the robustness of positive feedback mechanisms and the significance of NCED expression, or single metabolic change, during seed maturation. The pABRE:NCED system provides an excellent experimental system producing dormant and non-dormant seeds of the same maternal origin, which differ only in zygotic ABA. The pABRE:NCED seeds contain a GFP marker which enables seed sorting between transgenic and null segregants and are ideal for comparative analysis. In addition to its utility in basic research, the system can also be applied to prevention of pre-harvest sprouting during crop production, and therefore contributes to translational biology.

AB Inheritance of plant traits mainly depends upon nuclear genes, cytoplasmic factors and their interactions. In the present study, 32 alloplasmic lines accompanied by a euplasmic parental line (control) were evaluated using molecular (chloroplast microsatellite) and morpho-physiological traits during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. The results of combined analysis of variance showed the significant effect of growing seasons on most of the studied traits as well as the significant effect of cytoplasm on plant height, leaf net CO2 assimilation rate and grain yield per plant. Results of cluster analysis divided the six plasmons based on their phenotypic effects into three groups: (1) R and S-v type, D (Aegilops typica and Ae. ventricosa) and D-2 type, as well as B-type plasmon (euplasmic line); (2) a single plasmon of M type and three plasmons of B type; (3) all other B-type and a single D-type plasmon (Aegilops cylindrica). Molecular analysis showed that 20 primer pairs out of 26 chloroplastic microsatellite markers (cpSSR) produced polymorphic bands in the alloplasmic lines. A total of 50 alleles were identified with an average of 2.5 alleles per locus. In this study, polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.05 (WCt17 primer) to 0.49 (WCt9 primer). Cluster analysis of molecular data revealed that the alloplasmic lines belong to two major clusters, in which differentiation of cytoplasmic types belonging to the genus Triticum and Aegilops has been evident. Likewise, analysis of molecular variance showed significant differences between two studied groups (F (ST) = 0.67, P < 0.001). Overall, our findings indicated that the cpSSR markers can be valuable resources of polymorphic markers for the analysis of cytoplasm of Triticeae species, with the potential for clear differentiation in close species and genera of this tribe.

Expression of the metabolic regulatory gene causes the anthocyanin pigmentation in plant cells and makes the plant organs change color and easy to be observed. Screening of transgenic tissue on the basis of the anthocyanin pigmentation has been studied in wheat. In this paper, isolated scutella of wheat was transformed by Agrobacterium with a genetic construct(pBAC9075) consisting of the two anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory genes, B1 and C1 and a herbicide glyphosate resistant epsp gene, each under the control of the CaMV35S constitutive promoter. 132 transgenic plants were obtained.
   The results of PCR analysis showed that 5 of the 132 T-0 transgenic plants were positive. The anthocyanin pigmentation was observed in the shoots and leaves of some positive transgenic plants. The results showed that it is possible to use this visual trait as a tracking system for wheat transformation and permits the selection of the transgenic plants at an early growth stage.

AB Multi-environment trials represent a highly valuable tool for the identification of the genetic bases of crop yield potential and stress adaptation. A Diversity Array Technology(A (R))-based barley map has been developed in the 'Nure'A xA aEuro similar to Tremois' biparental Doubled Haploid population, harbouring the genomic position of a gene set with a putative role in the regulation of flowering time and abiotic stress response in barley. The population has been evaluated in eighteen location-by-year combinations across the Mediterranean basin. QTL mapping identified several genomic regions responsible for barley adaptation to Mediterranean conditions in terms of phenology, grain yield and yield component traits. The most frequently detected yield QTL had the early flowering HvCEN_EPS2 locus (chromosome 2H) as peak marker, showing a positive effect from the early winter parent 'Nure' in eight field trials, and explaining up to 45.8 % of the observed variance for grain yield. The HvBM5A_VRN-H1 locus on chromosome 5H and the genomic region possibly corresponding to PPD-H2 on chromosome 1H were significantly associated to grain yield in five and three locations, respectively. Environment-specific QTLs for grain yield, and clusters of yield component QTLs not related to phenology and or developmental genes (e.g. on chromosome 4H, BIN_09) were observed as well. The results of this work provide a valuable source of knowledge and tools for both explaining the genetic bases of barley yield adaptation across the Mediterranean basin, and using QTL-associated markers for MAS pre-breeding and breeding programmes.

AB Downy mildew (DM) is a plant disease that strongly limits maize production. The resistance (R) genes for this disease have been identified and characterized and serve as important tools for plant disease evaluation. In this study, partial genes for PIC15, PO145579, and zmcf5 were identified and analyzed in a panel of 60 public and private maize inbred lines using bioinformatics and statistics tools. These candidate R genes exhibited an average nucleotide diversity value of 0.015. The negative Tajima's D values for these genes suggested that purifying selection has played a role in the evolution of maize DM resistance genes. In addition, linkage disequilibrium among these genes occurred across an extent of similar to 200 bp. Using association analysis methods, a general linear model, and a mixed linear model, five polymorphisms within the partial PIC15 and PO145579 genes were detected and associated with DM disease. These are new polymorphisms that have not previously been reported in association with DM disease traits. Therefore, correlations between these new polymorphisms and DM disease in these germplasm collections could advance the development of a functional marker for marker-assisted selection of DM disease resistance in maize breeding programs.

AB Samples of wheat and triticale infected with leaf rust were collected from 2008 to 2010 in South Africa to identify Puccinia triticina races. Races were identified based on their virulence profile on standard differential lines. Eight races were identified from 362 isolates. The dominant races were 3SA133 (syn. PDRS) in 2008 (78 %) and 2009 (34 %), and 3SA145 (47 %) in 2010. Race 3SA145 (CCPS) identified in 2009 was a new race in South Africa with virulence for the adult plant resistance gene Lr37. Another new race, 3SA146 (MCDS), was identified in 2010. Race 3SA146 is also virulent for Lr37 but unlike 3SA145, it is virulent for Lr1 and Lr23 and avirulent for Lr3ka and Lr30. Microsatellite analysis showed that 3SA145 and 3SA146 shared 70 % genetic similarity with each other, but only 30 % similarity with other races in South Africa, suggesting that both represent foreign introductions. In seedling tests of 98 South African winter and spring cultivars and advanced breeding lines, 27 % were susceptible to 3SA145 and 3SA146 but resistant to 3SA133. In greenhouse studies of 59 spring wheat adult plants, 19 % of breeding lines and 46 % of cultivars were susceptible to 3SA145, whereas 29 % of the lines and 53 % of cultivars were susceptible to 3SA146. The cssfr6 gene-specific DNA marker confirmed the presence of Lr34 gene for leaf rust resistance in a homozygous condition in 28 wheat entries. Five entries were heterogeneous for Lr34. Several entries which were susceptible as seedlings to the new races carried Lr34. These lines are expected to show lower levels of leaf rust as adult plants. Results of these studies indicate a continued vulnerability of South African wheat cultivars to new races and emphasise the importance of regular rust monitoring and the need to incorporate genes for durable resistance.

AB Background: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is not only important for exploiting heterosis in crop plants, but also as a model for investigating nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction. CMS may be caused by mutations, rearrangement or recombination in the mitochondrial genome. Understanding the mitochondrial genome is often the first and key step in unraveling the molecular and genetic basis of CMS in plants. Comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the hau CMS line and its maintainer line in B. juneca (Brassica juncea) may help show the origin of the CMS-associated gene orf288.
   Results: Through next-generation sequencing, the B. juncea hau CMS mitochondrial genome was assembled into a single, circular-mapping molecule that is 247,903 bp in size and 45.08% in GC content. In addition to the CMS associated gene orf288, the genome contains 35 protein-encoding genes, 3 rRNAs, 25 tRNA genes and 29 ORFs of unknown function. The mitochondrial genome sizes of the maintainer line and another normal type line "J163-4" are both 219,863 bp and with GC content at 45.23%. The maintainer line has 36 genes with protein products, 3 rRNAs, 22 tRNA genes and 31 unidentified ORFs. Comparative analysis the mitochondrial genomes of the hau CMS line and its maintainer line allowed us to develop specific markers to separate the two lines at the seedling stage. We also confirmed that different mitotypes coexist substoichiometrically in hau CMS lines and its maintainer lines in B. juncea. The number of repeats larger than 100 bp in the hau CMS line (16 repeats) are nearly twice of those found in the maintainer line (9 repeats). Phylogenetic analysis of the CMS-associated gene orf288 and four other homologous sequences in Brassicaceae show that orf288 was clearly different from orf263 in Brassica tournefortii despite of strong similarity.
   Conclusion: The hau CMS mitochondrial genome was highly rearranged when compared with its iso-nuclear maintainer line mitochondrial genome. This study may be useful for studying the mechanism of natural CMS in B. juncea, performing comparative analysis on sequenced mitochondrial genomes in Brassicas, and uncovering the origin of the hau CMS mitotype and structural and evolutionary differences between different mitotypes.

AB Background: TaGW2-6A, cloned in earlier research, strongly influences wheat grain width and TKW. Here, we mainly analyzed haplotypes of TaGW2-6B and their effects on TKW and interaction with haplotypes at TaGW2-6A.
   Results: About 2.9 kb of the promoter sequences of TaGW2-6B and TaGW2-6D were cloned in 34 bread wheat cultivars. Eleven SNPs were detected in the promoter region of TaGW2-6B, forming 4 haplotypes, but no divergence was detected in the TaGW2-6D promoter or coding region. Three molecular markers including CAPS, dCAPS and ACAS, were developed to distinguish the TaGW2-6B haplotypes. Haplotype association analysis indicated that TaGW2-6B has a stronger influence than TaGW2-6A on TKW, and Hap-6B-1 was a favored haplotype increasing grain width and weight that had undergone strong positive selection in global wheat breeding. However, clear geographic distribution differences for TaGW2-6A haplotypes were found; Hap-6A-A was favored in Chinese, Australian and Russian cultivars, whereas Hap-6A-G was preferred in European, American and CIMMYT cultivars. This difference might be caused by a flowering and maturity time difference between the two haplotypes. Hap-6A-A is the earlier type. Haplotype interaction analysis between TaGW2-6A and TaGW2-6B showed additive effects between the favored haplotypes. Hap-6A-A/Hap-6B-1 was the best combination to increase TKW. Relative expression analysis of the three TaGW2 homoeologous genes in 22 cultivars revealed that TaGW2-6A underwent the highest expression. TaGW2-6D was the least expressed during grain development and TaGW2-6B was intermediate. Diversity of the three genes was negatively correlated with their effect on TKW.
   Conclusions: Genetic effects, expression patterns and historic changes of haplotypes at three homoeologous genes of TaGW2 influencing yield were dissected in wheat cultivars. Strong and constant selection to favored haplotypes has been found in global wheat breeding during the past century. This research also provides a valuable case for understanding interaction of genes that control complex traits in polyploid species.

AB Bacterial leaf steak (BLS) is one of the most destructive diseases in rice. Studies have shown that BLS resistance in rice is quantitatively inherited, controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A QTL with relatively large effect, qBlsr5a, was previously mapped in a region of similar to 380 kb on chromosome 5. To fine map qBlsr5a further, a set of overlapping sub-chromosome segment substitution lines (sub-CSSLs) were developed from a large secondary F-2 population (containing more than 7000 plants), in which only the chromosomal region harboring qBlsr5a was segregated. By genotyping the sub-CSSLs with molecular markers covering the target region and phenotyping the sub-CSSLs with artificial inoculation, qBlsr5a was delimited to a 30.0-kb interval, in which only three genes were predicted. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the three putative genes did not show significant response to the infection of BLS pathogen in both resistant and susceptible parental lines. However, two nucleotide substitutions were found in the coding sequence of gene LOC_ Os05g01710, which encodes the gamma chain of transcription initiation factor IIA (TFIIA gamma). The nucleotide substitutions resulted in a change of the 39th amino acid from valine (in the susceptible parent) to glutamic acid (in the resistant parent). Interestingly, the resistant parent allele of LOC_ Os05g01710 is identical to xa5, a major gene resistant to bacterial leaf blight (another bacterial disease of rice). These results suggest that LOC_ Os05g01710 is very possibly the candidate gene of qBlsr5a.

AB Background: The nematode Pratylenchus neglectus has a wide host range and is able to feed on the root systems of cereals, oilseeds, grain and pasture legumes. Under the Mediterranean low rainfall environments of Australia, annual Medicago pasture legumes are used in rotation with cereals to fix atmospheric nitrogen and improve soil parameters. Considerable efforts are being made in breeding programs to improve resistance and tolerance to Pratylenchus neglectus in the major crops wheat and barley, which makes it vital to develop appropriate selection tools in medics.
   Results: A strong source of tolerance to root damage by the root lesion nematode (RLN) Pratylenchus neglectus had previously been identified in line RH-1 (strand medic, M. littoralis). Using RH-1, we have developed a single seed descent (SSD) population of 138 lines by crossing it to the intolerant cultivar Herald. After inoculation, RLN-associated root damage clearly segregated in the population. Genetic analysis was performed by constructing a genetic map using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and gene-based SNP markers. A highly significant quantitative trait locus (QTL), QPnTolMl. 1, was identified explaining 49% of the phenotypic variation in the SSD population. All SSRs and gene-based markers in the QTL region were derived from chromosome 1 of the sequenced genome of the closely related species M. truncatula. Gene-based markers were validated in advanced breeding lines derived from the RH-1 parent and also a second RLN tolerance source, RH-2 (M. truncatula ssp. tricycla). Comparative analysis to sequenced legume genomes showed that the physical QTL interval exists as a synteny block in Lotus japonicus, common bean, soybean and chickpea. Furthermore, using the sequenced genome information of M. truncatula, the QTL interval contains 55 genes out of which five are discussed as potential candidate genes responsible for the mapped tolerance.
   Conclusion: The closely linked set of SNP-based PCR markers is directly applicable to select for two different sources of RLN tolerance in breeding programs. Moreover, genome sequence information has allowed proposing candidate genes for further functional analysis and nominates QPnTolMl. 1 as a target locus for RLN tolerance in economically important grain legumes, e. g. chickpea.

AB Tibetan annual wild barley is rich in genetic variation. This study was aimed at the exploitation of new SSRs for the genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of wild barley by data mining. We developed 49 novel EST-SSRs and confirmed 20 genomic SSRs for 80 Tibetan annual wild barley and 16 cultivated barley accessions. A total of 213 alleles were generated from 69 loci with an average of 3.14 alleles per locus. The trimeric repeats were the most abundant motifs (40.82%) among the EST-SSRs, while the majority of the genomic SSRs were di-nuleotide repeats. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.08 to 0.75 with a mean of 0.46. Besides this, the expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.0854 to 0.7842 with an average of 0.5279. Overall, the polymorphism of genomic SSRs was higher than that of EST-SSRs. Furthermore, the number of alleles and the PIC of wild barley were both higher than that of cultivated barley, being 3.12 vs 2.59 and 0.44 vs 0.37. Indicating more polymorphism existed in the Tibetan wild barley than in cultivated barley. The 96 accessions were divided into eight subpopulations based on 69 SSR markers, and the cultivated genotypes can be clearly separated from wild barleys. A total of 47 SSR-containing EST unigenes showed significant similarities to the known genes. These EST-SSR markers have potential for application in germplasm appraisal, genetic diversity and population structure analysis, facilitating marker-assisted breeding and crop improvement in barley.

AB Background: Monitoring alien introgressions in crop plants is difficult due to the lack of genetic and molecular mapping information on the wild crop relatives. The tertiary gene pool of wheat is a very important source of genetic variability for wheat improvement against biotic and abiotic stresses. By exploring the 5M(g) short arm (5M(g)S) of Aegilops geniculata, we can apply chromosome genomics for the discovery of SNP markers and their use for monitoring alien introgressions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L).
   Results: The short arm of chromosome 5M(g) of Ae. geniculata Roth (syn. Ae. ovata L.; 2n = 4x = 28, (UUMMg)-U-g-M-g-M-g) was flow-sorted from a wheat line in which it is maintained as a telocentric chromosome. DNA of the sorted arm was amplified and sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 2000 with similar to 45x coverage. The sequence data was used for SNP discovery against wheat homoeologous group-5 assemblies. A total of 2,178 unique, 5M(g)S-specific SNPs were discovered. Randomly selected samples of 59 5M(g)S-specific SNPs were tested (44 by KASPar assay and 15 by Sanger sequencing) and 84% were validated. Of the selected SNPs, 97% mapped to a chromosome 5M(g) addition to wheat (the source of t5M(g)S), and 94% to 5M(g) introgressed from a different accession of Ae. geniculata substituting for chromosome 5D of wheat. The validated SNPs also identified chromosome segments of 5M(g)S origin in a set of T5D-5M(g) translocation lines; eight SNPs (25%) mapped to TA5601 [T5DL . 5DS-5M(g)S(0.75)] and three (8%) to TA5602 [T5DL . 5DS-5M(g)S (0.95)]. SNPs (gsnp_5ms83 and gsnp_5ms94), tagging chromosome T5DL . 5DS-5M(g)S(0.95) with the smallest introgression carrying resistance to leaf rust (Lr57) and stripe rust (Yr40), were validated in two released germplasm lines with Lr57 and Yr40 genes.
   Conclusion: This approach should be widely applicable for the identification of species/genome-specific SNPs. The development of a large number of SNP markers will facilitate the precise introgression and monitoring of alien segments in crop breeding programs and further enable mapping and cloning novel genes from the wild relatives of crop plants.

AB Background: Improving digestive efficiency is a major goal in poultry production, to reduce production costs, make possible the use of alternative feedstuffs and decrease the volume of manure produced. Since measuring digestive efficiency is difficult, identifying molecular markers associated with genes controlling this trait would be a valuable tool for selection. Detection of QTL (quantitative trait loci) was undertaken on 820 meat-type chickens in a F2 cross between D- and D+ lines divergently selected on low or high AMEn (apparent metabolizable energy value of diet corrected to 0 nitrogen balance) measured at three weeks in animals fed a low-quality diet. Birds were measured for 13 traits characterizing digestive efficiency (AMEn, coefficients of digestive utilization of starch, lipids, proteins and dry matter (CDUS, CDUL, CDUP, CDUDM)), anatomy of the digestive tract (relative weights of the proventriculus, gizzard and intestine and proventriculus plus gizzard (RPW, RGW, RIW, RPGW), relative length and density of the intestine (RIL, ID), ratio of proventriculus and gizzard to intestine weight (PG/I); and body weight at 23 days of age. Animals were genotyped for 6000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) distributed on 28 autosomes, the Z chromosome and one unassigned linkage group.
   Results: Nine QTL for digestive efficiency traits, 11 QTL for anatomy-related traits and two QTL for body weight at 23 days of age were detected. On chromosome 20, two significant QTL at the genome level co-localized for CDUS and CDUDM, i.e. two traits that are highly correlated genetically. Moreover, on chromosome 16, chromosome-wide QTL for AMEn, CDUS, CDUDM and CDUP, on chromosomes 23 and 26, chromosome-wide QTL for CDUS, on chromosomes 16 and 26, co-localized QTL for digestive efficiency and the ratio of intestine length to body weight and on chromosome 27 a chromosome-wide QTL for CDUDM were identified.
   Conclusions: This study identified several regions of the chicken genome involved in the control of digestive efficiency. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying genes and to validate these in commercial populations and breeding environments.

AB Inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) and retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) techniques were successfully applied, for the first time, to analyze genetic diversity among 92 ginger landraces collected from north-western Himalayan region of India. Six IRAP primer/combinations generated 75 loci with an average of 12 loci/primer displaying an overall polymorphism of 95.95 %. On the other hand, twenty five REMAP primer combinations produced 414 loci with 96.5 % polymorphism. IRAP showed maximum Rp (5.39) and PIC (0.28) values, while the same in REMAP was observed to be 10.92 and 0.34. Cluster analysis using Jaccard's similarity coefficient for IRAP and REMAP data ranged between 0.21 to 1.0 and 0.21 to 0.85, respectively distinguishing all the genotypes with diverse genetic makup. The results also confirmed the presence of sukkula retrotransposon (RT6) in the ginger genome which effectively acted as genetic marker revealing high regional genetic diversity in the ginger gene pool. The study will help in giving insight to the genetic constitution of vegetatively grown ginger crop and for its further utilization in improvement, conservation and management programmes.

AB This study investigated the population genetics, demographic history and pathway of invasion of the Russian wheat aphid (RWA) from its native range in Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe to South Africa and the Americas. We screened microsatellite markers, mitochondrial DNA and endosymbiont genes in 504 RWA clones from nineteen populations worldwide. Following pathway analyses of microsatellite and endosymbiont data, we postulate that Turkey and Syria were the most likely sources of invasion to Kenya and South Africa, respectively. Furthermore, we found that one clone transferred between South Africa and the Americas was most likely responsible for the New World invasion. Finally, endosymbiont DNA was found to be a high-resolution population genetic marker, extremely useful for studies of invasion over a relatively short evolutionary history time frame. This study has provided valuable insights into the factors that may have facilitated the recent global invasion by this damaging pest.

AB The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) is an extremely damaging aphid pest of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) particularly in the southern Great Plains of the USA. The simply inherited, dominant resistance gene Rsg1 is in all greenbug-resistant US barley cultivars. In this study, we conducted molecular mapping of Rsg1 using an F-2:3 population derived from a cross between the greenbug-resistant Post 90*4/R015 and susceptible CI2260 inbred lines. Segregation of host responses to greenbug biotype E infestation confirmed that a single dominant gene is responsible for greenbug resistance in Post 90*4/R015. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers evenly distributed along the seven barley chromosomes were employed for the construction of a framework genetic map. Linkage analysis placed the Rsg1 locus in the long arm of chromosome 3H (3HL) flanked by SSR markers Bmag0877 and GBM1420 that were 35cM apart. Polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in 3HL were identified from an Illumina GoldenGate SNP assay and used for targeted mapping to locate Rsg1 to an 8.4-cM interval. Comparative analysis identified syntenic genomic regions in Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 2, in which 37 putative genes were annotated including a NB-LRR-type resistance gene homologue that may be a potential candidate gene for the Rsg1 locus of barley. Results from this study offer a starting point for fine mapping and cloning of this aphid resistance gene in barley.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the major wheat diseases worldwide and poses a constant threat to common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production and food security. Results from the F-2 and F-2:3 populations derived from a cross between resistant line Fundulea 900 and susceptible cultivar Thatcher indicated that a single dominant gene, tentatively designated LrFun, conferred resistance to leaf rust. In order to identify other possible genes in Fundulea 900, nine P. triticina pathotypes avirulent on Fundulea 900 were used to inoculate F-2:3 families. The results showed that at least two leaf rust resistance genes were present in Fundulea 900. A total of 1,706 pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. Eight polymorphic markers from chromosome 7BL were used for genotyping the F-2 and F-2:3 populations. LrFun was linked to eight SSR loci on chromosome 7BL. The two closest flanking SSR loci were Xgwm344 and Xwmc70, with genetic distances of 4.4 and 5.7 cM, respectively. At present four leaf rust resistance genes, Lr14a, Lr14b, Lr68 and LrBi16, are located on chromosome 7BL. In a seedling test with 12 P. triticina isolates, the reaction patterns of LrFun were different from those of lines carrying Lr14a, Lr14b and LrBi16. Lr68 is an adult plant resistance gene, and it is different from the seedling resistance gene LrFun. Therefore, we concluded that LrFun is a new leaf rust resistance gene.

AB The Chi gene encodes the flavonoid synthesis enzyme chalcone-flavanone isomerase. The complete coding sequence of the Chi gene was isolated by PCR from four cultivars of cereal rye (Secale cereale L.). Unlike most monocot and dicot plant species, S. cereale has one, rather than three introns in the Chi gene. Screening of a panel of 63 Triticeae accessions, representing 31 species, showed two intron loss events in the Triticeae tribe. One intron loss occurred early in the evolution of the Triticeae tribe, while another intron loss was only detected in S. cereale Chi. A new rye-specific PCR marker was developed based on Chi intron loss polymorphism and was shown to be effective for analysis of a wide range of intergenera Triticeae hybrids for the presence of rye genome. In addition, precise genetic mapping of the rye Chi gene was carried out based on insertion/deletion polymorphism between parents of a rye mapping population. The Chi gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5R 9.3 cM distal to the restriction fragment length polymorphism marker Xscb35 and 4.4 cM proximal to the locus 3Rt encoding another flavonoid synthesis enzyme, anthocyanidin-3-glucoside rhamnosyltransferase.

AB Roots are essential for normal growth, development, and reproduction of higher plants. Consequently, improvement of root system architecture and functionality is of fundamental importance in crop improvement. However, the genetic mechanisms controlling root morphology and function are still not well understood, especially in common wheat, which possesses a complex and unsequenced hexaploid genome. Here we report a more detailed genetic analysis of qTaLRO-B1, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) previously detected to affect root length and related traits in common wheat. A pair of QTL isolines with different qTaLRO-B1 alleles was developed. Line 178B, carrying the longer root allele, was significantly more efficient in taking up phosphate nutrient and biomass accumulation than line 178A, with the shorter root allele. We mapped qTaLRO-B1 to a 0.9-cM interval on common wheat chromosome 2BS with seven sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers developed from the genes conserved between wheat and Brachypodium distachyon. The seven STS markers were collinearly conserved in tetraploid wheat, but they covered a much larger genetic distance (22.8 cM) in the latter species. In conclusion, we have converted qTaLRO-B1 into a major gene that affects common wheat root length in a qualitative manner, and improved understanding of the genetic location of qTaLRO-B1 and the chromosomal segment carrying this important locus. The implications of our data for further study of qTaLRO-B1 are discussed.

AB This research provided the first view of metabolic and physiological effect of a tissue-specific glaucousness inhibitor in wheat and laid foundation for map-based cloning of the Iw3 locus.
   Cuticular wax constitutes the outermost layer of plant skin, and its composition greatly impacts plant appearance and plant-environment interaction. Epicuticular wax in the upper part of adult wheat plants can form the glaucousness, which is associated with drought tolerance. In this research, we characterized a glume-specific glaucousness inhibitor, Iw3, by fine mapping, physiological, and molecular approaches. Iw3 inhibits glaucousness formation by altering wax composition. Compared to the wild type, Iw3 eliminated beta-diketone, reduced 47 % primary alcohols, but increased aldehyde 400-fold and alkanes fivefold, which led to 30 % reduction of total glume wax load. Loss of the glaucousness increased cuticle permeability, suggesting an important role in drought sensitivity. Genetically, the glaucousness-inhibiting effect by Iw3 is partially dominant in a dosage-dependent manner. We localized the Iw3 locus within a 0.13-cM interval delimited by marker loci Xpsp3000 and XWL3096. Of the 53 wax genes assayed, we detected transcription changes in nine genes by Iw3, downregulation of Cer4-1 and upregulation of other five Cer4 and three KCS homologs. All these results provided initial insights into Iw3-mediated regulation of wax metabolism and paved way for in-depth characterization of the Iw3 locus and the glaucousness-related beta-diketone pathway.

AB Stripe rust resistance transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium into common wheat was controlled by a single dominant gene, which mapped to chromosome 1B near Yr26 and was designated YrL693.
   Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is a highly destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Stripe rust resistance was transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium to common wheat, and the resulting introgression line (L693) exhibited all-stage resistance to the widely virulent and predominant Chinese pathotypes CYR32 and CYR33 and to the new virulent pathotype V26. There was no cytological evidence that L693 had alien chromosomal segments from Th. intermedium. Genetic analysis of stripe rust resistance was performed by crossing L693 with the susceptible line L661. F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 populations from reciprocal crosses showed that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. A total 479 F-2:3 lines and 781 pairs of genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were employed to determine the chromosomal location of the resistance gene. The gene was linked to six publicly available and three recently developed wheat genomic SSR markers. The linked markers were localized to wheat chromosome 1B using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines, and the resistance gene was localized to chromosome 1B based on SSR and wheat genomic information. A high-density genetic map was also produced. The pedigree, molecular marker data, and resistance response indicated that the stripe rust resistance gene in L693 is a novel gene, which was temporarily designated YrL693. The SSR markers that co-segregate with this gene (Xbarc187-1B, Xbarc187-1B-1, Xgwm18-1B, and Xgwm11-1B) have potential application in marker-assisted breeding of wheat, and YrL693 will be useful for broadening the genetic basis of stripe rust resistance in wheat.

AB After cloning and mapping of wheat TaSdr genes, both the functional markers for TaSdr - B1 and TaVp - 1B were validated, and the distribution of allelic variations at TaSdr - B1 locus in the wheat cultivars from 19 countries was characterized.
   Seed dormancy is a major factor associated with pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat TaSdr genes, orthologs of OsSdr4 conferring seed dormancy in rice, were cloned by a comparative genomics approach. They were located on homoeologous group 2 chromosomes, and designated as TaSdr-A1, TaSdr-B1 and TaSdr-D1, respectively. Sequence analysis of TaSdr-B1 revealed a SNP at the position -11 upstream of the initiation codon, with bases A and G in cultivars with low and high germination indices (GI), respectively. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence marker Sdr2B was developed based on the SNP, and subsequently functional analysis of TaSdr-B1 was conducted by association and linkage mapping. A QTL for GI co-segregating with Sdr2B explained 6.4, 7.8 and 8.7 % of the phenotypic variances in a RIL population derived from Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 grown in Shijiazhuang, Beijing and the averaged data from those environments, respectively. Two sets of Chinese wheat cultivars were used for association mapping, and results indicated that TaSdr-B1 was significantly associated with GI. Analysis of the allelic distribution at the TaSdr-B1 locus showed that the frequencies of TaSdr-B1a associated with a lower GI were high in cultivars from Japan, Australia, Argentina, and the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valley Winter Wheat Region and Southwest Winter Wheat Region in China. This study provides not only a reliable functional marker for molecular-assisted selection of PHS in wheat breeding programs, but also gives novel information for a comprehensive understanding of seed dormancy.

AB This manuscript reports a new gene for non-race-specific resistance to stripe rust and molecular markers for incorporating it into wheat cultivars for control of the disease with durable resistance.
   Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive wheat diseases worldwide. The spring wheat germplasm 'PI 178759' originating from Iraq showed effective resistance to stripe rust in field evaluations over 8 years in Washington state, USA. To map the resistance gene(s), PI 178759 was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible', and the parents and 176 F-2:3 lines were phenotyped in the fields under natural infection and in a greenhouse with selected races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. PI 178759 was identified to have high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism and simple sequence repeat techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene and a chromosome region was mapped using a quantitative trait locus approach. One major gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7B. Flanked by Xwgp5175 and Xbarc32 in a 2.1 cM region, the gene explained 31.8 and 54.7 % of the phenotypic variation in rAUDPC and IT, respectively. Based on genetic distances among markers and allelism tests, the HTAP resistance gene in PI 178759 is different from the previously reported Yr39, Yr52, YrZH84, and YrC591, also located on chromosome 7BL, and is therefore designated as Yr59. The gene and its flanking markers should be useful for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance.

AB Fine mapping of the Ug99 effective stem rust resistance gene Sr45 introgressed into common wheat from the D -genome goatgrass Aegilops tauschii.
   Stem rust resistance gene Sr45, discovered in Aegilops tauschii, the progenitor of the D -genome of wheat, is effective against commercially important Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici races prevalent in Australia, South Africa and the Ug99 race group. A synthetic hexaploid wheat (RL5406) generated by crossing Ae. tauschii accession RL5289 (carrying Sr45 and the leaf rust resistance gene Lr21) with a tetraploid experimental line 'TetraCanthatch' was previously used as the source in the transfer of these rust resistance genes to other hexaploid cultivars. Previous genetic studies on hexaploid wheats mapped Sr45 on the short arm of chromosome 1D with the following gene order: centromere-Sr45-Sr33-Lr21-telomere. To identify closely linked markers, we fine mapped the Sr45 region in a large mapping population generated by crossing CS1D5406 (disomic substitution line with chromosome 1D of RL5406 substituted for Chinese Spring 1D) with Chinese Spring. Closely linked markers based on 1DS-specific microsatellites, expressed sequence tags and AFLP were useful in the delineation of the Sr45 region. Sequences from an AFLP marker amplified a fragment that was linked with Sr45 at a distance of 0.39 cM. The fragment was located in a bacterial artificial chromosome clone of contig (ctg)2981 of the Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78 physical map. A PCR marker derived from clone MI221O11 of ctg2981 amplified 1DS-specific sequence that harboured an 18-bp indel polymorphism that specifically tagged the Sr45 carrying haplotype. This new Sr45 marker can be combined with a previously reported marker for Lr21, which will facilitate selecting Sr45 and Lr21 in breeding populations.

AB Marker genes are essential for the selection and identification of rarely occurring transformation events generated in biotechnology. This includes plastid transformation, which requires that multiple copies of the modified chloroplast genome be present to obtain genetically stable transplastomic plants. However, the marker gene becomes dispensable when homoplastomic plants are obtained. Here, we demonstrate the precise excision of attP- and attB-flanked DNA from the plastid genome mediated by the large serine recombinase Bxb1. We transformed the tobacco plastid genome with the pTCH-PB vector containing a stuffer fragment of DNA flanked by directly oriented nonhomologous attP and attB recombinase recognition sites. In the absence of the Bxb1 recombinase, the transformed plastid genomes were stable and heritable. Nuclear-transformed transgenic tobacco plants expressing a plastid-targeted Bxb1 recombinase were crossed with transplastomic pTCH-PB plants, and the T-1 hybrids exhibited efficient excision of the target sequence. The Bxb1-att system should prove to be a useful tool for site-specifically manipulating the plastid genome and generating marker-free transplastomic plants.

AB The recent report of a differential response of wheat lines containing the Pch2 gene to infection with the eyespot pathogens Oculimacula yallundae and O.acuformis has prompted this re-examination of the response to these fungi by the recombinant lines used to map Pch2. Homozygous recombinant substitution lines (RSL) derived from the hybridization of Chinese Spring (CS) and the CS chromosome substitution line Cappelle Desprez 7A (CS/CD7A), previously evaluated for response to glucuronidase (GUS)-transformed O.yallundae, were evaluated for response to infection with GUS-transformed O.acuformis. Based on visual scores and on GUS expression level, which reflects fungal colonization of seedling plants, evidence of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) conferring resistance to O.acuformis was found in two separate growth chamber experiments (logarithm of the odds, LOD,=27 and 67 at 305 and 289cM, respectively) that was equivalent in location to that for resistance to O.yallundae (LOD=132 and 114 at 289 and 304cM, respectively). These results confirm that Pch2 confers some degree of resistance against both O.yallundae and O.acuformis under these conditions.

AB A study was carried out in which seedling resistance to the crown rust pathogen, Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca), was characterised among 385 oat accessions of Avena strigosa, A. barbata and A. sativa from the USDA-ARS National Small Grains Collection. Accessions were tested with eight Australian pathotypes of Pca of diverse pathogenicity on a series of differential genotypes carrying known seedling resistance genes. Three diploid accessions, CIav2524, PI78821 and PI83721 of A. strigosa, were highly resistant to all eight Pca pathotypes, and were postulated to carry Pc50 and Pc68, Pc91, or one or more new resistance genes. A total of 58 unidentified resistance specificities were detected among the tetraploid A. barbata accessions. All 58 resistances were ineffective against at least one of the Pca pathotypes and could therefore be novel. Additionally, evidence was obtained for the presence of genes Pc39 and Pc52 (in A. barbata and A. sativa accessions), Pc45 (in A. barbata accessions), Pc94 (in A. strigosa and A. barbata accessions) and the "Saia" resistance (in A. strigosa accessions).

AB A recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population developed from a cross between winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars Coda and Brundage was evaluated for reaction to stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici). Two hundred and sixty eight RIL from the population were evaluated in replicated field trials in a total of nine site-year locations in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. Seedling reaction to stripe rust races PST-100, PST-114 and PST-127 was also examined. A linkage map consisting of 2,391 polymorphic DNA markers was developed covering all chromosomes of wheat with the exception of 1D. Two QTL on chromosome 1B were associated with adult plant and seedling reaction and were the most significant QTL detected. Together these QTL reduced adult plant infection type from a score of seven to a score of two reduced disease severity by an average of 25% and provided protection against race PST-100, PST-114 and PST-127 in the seedling stage. The location of these QTL and the race specificity provided by them suggest that observed effects at this locus are due to a complementation of the previously known but defeated resistances of the cultivar Tres combining with that of Madsen (the two parent cultivars of Coda). Two additional QTL on chromosome 3B and one on 5B were associated with adult plant reaction only, and a single QTL on chromosome 5D was associated with seedling reaction to PST-114. Coda has been resistant to stripe rust since its release in 2000, indicating that combining multiple resistance genes for stripe rust provides durable resistance, especially when all-stage resistance genes are combined in a fashion to maximize the number of races they protect against. Identified molecular markers will allow for an efficient transfer of these genes into other cultivars, thereby continuing to provide excellent resistance to stripe rust.

AB Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) not only is cultivated as pasture fodder but also could provide many desirable genes for wheat improvement. It is critical to obtain common wheat-A. cristatum alien disomic addition lines to locate the desired genes on the P genome chromosomes. Comparative analysis of the homoeologous relationships between the P genome chromosome and wheat genome chromosomes is a key step in transferring different desirable genes into common wheat and producing the desired alien translocation line while compensating for the loss of wheat chromatin. In this study, six common wheat-A. cristatum disomic addition lines were produced and analyzed by phenotypic examination, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), SSR markers from the ABD genomes and STS markers from the P genome. Comparative maps, six in total, were generated and demonstrated that all six addition lines belonged to homoeologous group 6. However, chromosome 6P had undergone obvious rearrangements in different addition lines compared with the wheat chromosome, indicating that to obtain a genetic compensating alien translocation line, one should recombine alien chromosomal regions with homoeologous wheat chromosomes. Indeed, these addition lines were classified into four types based on the comparative mapping: 6P(I), 6P(II), 6P(III), and 6P(IV). The different types of chromosome 6P possessed different desirable genes. For example, the 6PI type, containing three addition lines, carried genes conferring high numbers of kernels per spike and resistance to powdery mildew, important traits for wheat improvement. These results may prove valuable for promoting the development of conventional chromosome engineering techniques toward molecular chromosome engineering.

AB Barley is a model plant in genomic studies of Triticeae species. However, barley's large genome size and high repetitive sequence content complicate the whole-genome sequencing. The majority of the barley genome is composed of transposable elements (TEs). In this study, TE repeat junctions (RJs) were used to develop a large-scale molecular marker platform, as a prerequisite to genome assembly. A total of 10.22 Gb of barley nonassembled 454 sequencing data were screened with RJPrimers pipeline. In total, 9,881,561 TE junctions were identified. From detected RJs, 400,538 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based RJ markers (RJMs) were designed across the genome, with an average of 39 markers/Mb. The utility of designed markers was tested using a random subset of RJMs. Over 94% of the markers successfully amplified amplicons, among which similar to 90% were genome specific. In addition to marker design, identified RJs were utilized to detect 1190,885 TEs across the genome. In gene-poor regions of the genome Gypsy elements comprised the majority of TEs (similar to 65%), while in gene-rich regions Gypsy, Copia, and Mariner were the main transposons, each representing an average similar to 23% of total TEs. The numerous RJ primer pairs developed in this study will be a valuable resource for barley genomic studies including genomic selection, fine mapping, and genome assembly. In addition, the results of this study show that characterizing RJs provides insight into TE composition of species without a sequenced genome but for which short-read sequence data is available.

AB The Lr19 translocation continues to provide broad resistance to Puccinia triticina in many parts of the world and can be particularly useful in resistance gene pyramids. Previously, an associated gene for yellow endosperm pigmentation precluded its use in many countries, and as a result, allosyndetic recombinants and mutants lacking the pigmentation genes have been developed. Such a primary white endosperm recombinant (Lr19-149) and four secondary recombinants (Lr19-149-252, -299, -462, and -478) were obtained in earlier studies. This study characterized the translocations making use of fluorescence genomic in situ hybridization (FGISH), simple sequence repeat (SSR), sequence tagged site (STS), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The recombined segments were shown to be intercalary inserts of different size and were mapped to the most distal 7BL deletion bin. In addition to a previously reported duplication that involves the Wsp-1 locus, primary recombinant -149 also has a deletion of the PSY-1 containing region. These apparently small aberrations have been retained in three of the secondary recombinants that resulted from single, proximal crossovers. The fourth secondary recombinant (-478) resulted from a distal crossover that apparently restored a normal wheat telomeric region with single copies of the Wsp-B1 and PSY-B1 loci and appears to be the most useful.

   LOCATION
AB Yellow (stripe) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) all over the world, particularly in the Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region. Host plant resistance is the most economical and environment friendly approach to combating wheat rusts through the deployment of resistant cultivars. In this study, we report findings from an association mapping (AM) study of resistance to Pst in 167 facultative/winter elite wheat genotypes. The genotypes were evaluated for resistance to yellow rust (YR) at the adult plant stage and other agronomic traits for 2 yr (2011-2012) at ICARDA field station, Tel Hadya, Syria. The same genotypes were genotyped using 3051 diversity array technology (DArT) markers of which 1586 were of known chromosome positions. Out of the 167 genotypes evaluated for YR resistance, 65 genotypes (38.9%) were resistant, 20 genotypes (12%) were moderately resistant, 30 genotypes (18%) were moderately susceptible, and 52 genotypes (31.1%) were susceptible. Elite genotypes with high yield potential and YR resistance were identified and have been distributed to the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) for potential direct release and/or use as parents after local adaptation trials by the respective countries. Further, AM analysis using a mixed linear model (MLM), corrected for population structure and kinship relatedness and adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR), identified five genomic regions located on wheat chromosomes 2BL, 4BS, 6AS, 6BL, and 7BL which are significantly associated with genes conferring resistance to YR. The loci located on chromosome 4BS appeared to be a novel quantitative trait loci (QTL). These loci may be useful for choosing parents and incorporating new YR resistance genes into locally adapted wheat cultivars.

AB Ridge regression with heteroscedastic marker variances provides an alternative to Bayesian genome-wide prediction methods. Our objectives were to suggest new methods to determine marker-specific shrinkage factors for heteroscedastic ridge regression and to investigate their properties with respect to computational efficiency and accuracy of estimated effects. We analyzed published data sets of maize, wheat, and sugar beet as well as simulated data with the new methods. Ridge regression with shrinkage factors that were proportional to single-marker analysis of variance estimates of variance components (i.e., RRWA) was the fastest method. It required computation times of less than 1 sec for medium-sized data sets, which have dimensions that are common in plant breeding. A modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm that yields heteroscedastic marker variances (i.e., RMLV) resulted in the most accurate marker effect estimates. It outperformed the homoscedastic ridge regression approach for best linear unbiased prediction in particular for situations with high marker density and strong linkage disequilibrium along the chromosomes, a situation that occurs often in plant breeding populations. We conclude that the RRWA and RMLV approaches provide alternatives to the commonly used Bayesian methods, in particular for applications in which computational feasibility or accuracy of effect estimates are important, such as detection or functional analysis of genes or planning crosses.

AB We investigated the effect of auxin and acetylcholine on the expression of the tomato expansin gene LeEXPA2, a specific expansin gene expressed in elongating tomato hypocotyl segments. Since auxin interferes with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, in order to regulate cellular and developmental responses we produced protoplasts from tomato elongating hypocotyls and followed the endocytotic marker, FM4-64, internalization in response to treatments. Tomato protoplasts were observed during auxin and acetylcholine treatments after transient expression of chimerical markers of volume-control related compartments such as vacuoles. Here we describe the contribution of auxin and acetylcholine to LeEXPA2 expression regulation and we support the hypothesis that a possible subcellular target of acetylcholine signal is the vesicular transport, shedding some light on the characterization of this small molecule as local mediator in the plant physiological response.

To identify and map genes for stripe rust resistance in wheat cultivar 'Wuhan 2', an F-2 population was developed from a cross between the cultivar and susceptible cultivar Mingxian 169. The parents, 179 F-2 plants and their derived F2: 3 lines were evaluated for responses to Chinese races CYR30 and CYR31 of the pathogen in a greenhouse. A recessive gene for resistance was identified. DNA bulked segregant analysis was applied and resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. A genetic map consisting of five RGAP and six SSR markers was constructed. The recessive gene, designated Yrwh2, was located on the short arm of chromosome 3B and flanked by SSR markers Xwmc540 and Xgwm566 at 5.9 and 10.0 cM, respectively. The chromosomal location of the resistance gene and its close marker suggest that the locus is different from previously reported stripe rust resistance genes Yr30, QYr.ucw-3BS, Yrns-B1, YrRub and QYrex.wgp-3BL previously mapped to chromosome 3B. Yrwh2 and its closely linked markers are potentially useful for developing stripe rust resistance wheat cultivars if used in combination with other genes.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important diseases on wheat in China. To assess resistance in wheat cultivars and breeding lines in China, 330 leading cultivars and 164 advanced breeding lines were evaluated with stripe rust. In the greenhouse tests, seedlings of the entries were inoculated separately with several Pst pathotypes. In the field tests, the entries were evaluated for stripe rust resistance in Yangling, Shaanxi Province artificially inoculated and in Tianshui, Gansu Province under natural infection of Pst. The oversummering/wintering and spring epidemic zones of resistance genes were postulated using molecular markers for Yr5, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, and Yr26, in combination with resistance spectra. Out of the 494 wheat entries, 16 (3.24 %) entries had all-stage resistance (ASR) in all race tests, 99 (20.04 %) had adult-plant resistance (APR), 28 (5.67 %) were considered to have slow-rusting (SR), and 351 (71.05 %) were susceptible to one or more races in both seedling and adult-plant stages. Advanced breeding lines had a higher percentage (37.2 %) of resistant entries (The sum of ASR, APR and SR) than leading cultivars (24.85 %). Among the epidemic regions, southern Gansu had a higher percentage of resistant entries than any other regions. Based on stripe rust reactions and molecular markers, two cultivars were found to possibly have Yr5 while no entries have Yr10 or Yr15. Resistance genes Yr9, Yr17, Yr18, and Yr26 were found in 134 (29.4 %), 45 (9.1 %), 10 (2 %), and 15 (3 %) entries, respectively.

AB Predicting phenology, in particular heading time, is crucial to avoid and/or minimize risk of damage of frost, drought and high temperatures during grain filling. Although some of the major genes controlling development, associated with photoperiod and vernalization responses, were identified, the association between the molecular characterization of those genes and photoperiod sensitivity, vernalization responses and earliness per se has been poorly studied. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of photoperiod and vernalization genes (and their allelic combination characterized by molecular approach) on heading time and its correlation with the phenological parameters determined by field experiments in a wide range of Argentine bread wheat commercial cultivars. Additionally, the association between photoperiod and vernalization responses with earliness per se was analyzed. Molecular characterization showed that most of the commercial Argentine wheat cultivars available in the market correspond to spring growth habit with dominant insensitive photoperiod alleles (SI) followed by spring habit sensitive to photoperiod (SS), while winter insensitive (WI) habit represented a minority group. All genotypes included in the present study (even those classified as SI and WI) were photoperiod sensitive when that trait was quantified from a physiological analysis as the slope of the relationship between duration of a particular phase and mean photoperiod sensed during the period between emergence and heading. SI showed lower photoperiod sensitivity than SS and WI, without clear differences between both later groups. In all cases, photoperiod sensitivity was the main attribute that determined the differences in time to heading even when vernalization requirements were not completely fulfilled in the WI. The genotypes with different photoperiod and vernalization allele combinations showed a wide range of duration of earliness per se. However, differences in earliness per se did not show any particular association with the groups classified by molecular markers for photoperiod and vernalization. The information included in the present study can be used to build a gene-based model for predicting phenology. However, the variations in photoperiod and/or vernalization sensitivity within the same allelic combination could still determine mismatching in the prediction of the models based on Ppd-1 and Vrn-1 genes.

AB Rye (Secale cereale) chromosome 1RS harbors multiple genes including Lr26, Sr31, Yr9 and Pm8 conferring disease resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses. The introgression of the rye 1R chromosome short arm has enormously contributed to increase of genetic diversity in wheat. Utilization of such translocations in breeding programs demands identification of wheat germplasm possessing the wheat-alien chromosome translocation. This study was designed to screen a set of 102 Pakistani wheat cultivars and candidate lines to identify the rye T1BL.1RS translocation, using cytological, biochemical, and molecular techniques. Results revealed that 12 out of the 40 wheat cultivars were found to have this alien introgression. In the National Uniform Wheat Yield Trials (NUWYT) group, 10 of 23 entries of the rainfed category were identified as carrying 1BL.1RS translocation, while 4 out of 39 genotypes were present in the irrigated category of both NUWYT crop seasons. The valuable information generated can be useful in the crop improvement programs for the production of germplasm possessing T1BL.1RS translocation, in order to enhance the genetic variability in local wheat cultivars and, also, avoid the preponderance of T1BL.1RS candidates.

AB Powdery mildew would be one of the most damaging wheat diseases without the extensive use of conventional fungicides. Some of the alternative control strategies currently emerging are based on the use of resistance inducers. The disacharride trehalose (TR) is classically described as an inducer of defenses in plants to abiotic stress. In this work, the elicitor or priming effect of TR was investigated in wheat both before and during a compatible wheat powdery mildew interaction through molecular, biochemical, and cytological approaches. In noninoculated conditions, TR elicited the expression of genes encoding chitinase (chi, chi1, and chi4 precursor), pathogenesis-related protein 1, as well as oxalate oxidase (oxo). Moreover, lipid metabolism was shown to be altered by TR spraying via the upregulation of lipoxygenase (lox) and lipid-transfer protein (ltp)-encoding gene expression. On the other hand, the protection conferred by TR to wheat against powdery mildew is associated with the induction of two specific defense markers. Indeed, in infectious conditions following TR spraying, upregulations of chi4 precursor and lox gene expression as well as an induction of the LOX activity were observed. These results are also discussed with regard to the impact of TR on the fungal infectious process, which was shown to be stopped at the appressorial germ tube stage. Our findings strongly suggest that TR is a true inducer of wheat defense and resistance, at least toward powdery mildew.

AB Key message New methods that incorporate the main and interaction effects of high-dimensional markers and of high-dimensional environmental covariates gave increased prediction accuracy of grain yield in wheat across and within environments.
   In most agricultural crops the effects of genes on traits are modulated by environmental conditions, leading to genetic by environmental interaction (G x E). Modern genotyping technologies allow characterizing genomes in great detail and modern information systems can generate large volumes of environmental data. In principle, G x E can be accounted for using interactions between markers and environmental covariates (ECs). However, when genotypic and environmental information is high dimensional, modeling all possible interactions explicitly becomes infeasible. In this article we show how to model interactions between high-dimensional sets of markers and ECs using covariance functions. The model presented here consists of (random) reaction norm where the genetic and environmental gradients are described as linear functions of markers and of ECs, respectively. We assessed the proposed method using data from Arvalis, consisting of 139 wheat lines genotyped with 2,395 SNPs and evaluated for grain yield over 8 years and various locations within northern France. A total of 68 ECs, defined based on five phases of the phenology of the crop, were used in the analysis. Interaction terms accounted for a sizable proportion (16 %) of the within-environment yield variance, and the prediction accuracy of models including interaction terms was substantially higher (17-34 %) than that of models based on main effects only. Breeding for target environmental conditions has become a central priority of most breeding programs. Methods, like the one presented here, that can capitalize upon the wealth of genomic and environmental information available, will become increasingly important.

AB Key Message This is the first report on genetic analysis and genome mapping of major dominant genes for near non-host resistance to barley crown rust ( Puccinia coronata var. hordei ) in common wheat.
   Barley crown rust, caused by Puccinia coronata var. hordei, primarily occurs on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in the Great Plain regions of the United States. However, a few genotypes of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were susceptible to this pathogen among 750 wheat accessions evaluated. To investigate the genetics of crown rust resistance in wheat, a susceptible winter wheat accession PI 350005 was used in crosses with two resistant wheat varieties, Chinese Spring and Chris. Analysis of F-1 plants and F-2 populations from these two crosses indicated that crown rust resistance is controlled by one and two dominant genes in Chris and Chinese Spring, respectively. To determine the chromosome location of the resistance gene Cr1 in Chris, a set of 21 monosomic lines derived from Chris was used as female parents to cross with a susceptible spring type selection (SSTS35) derived from the PI 350005/Chris cross. Monosomic analysis indicated that Cr1 is located on chromosome 5D in Chris and one of the crown rust resistance genes is located on chromosome 2D in Chinese Spring. The other gene in Chinese Spring is not on 5D and thus is different from Cr1. Molecular linkage analysis and QTL mapping using a population of 136 doubled haploid lines derived from Chris/PI 350005 further positioned Cr1 between SSR markers Xwmc41-2 and Xgdm63 located on the long arm of chromosome 5D. Our study suggests that near non-host resistance to crown rust in these different common wheat genotypes is simply inherited.

AB Key message A cytogenetic map of wheat was constructed using FISH with cDNA probes. FISH markers detected homoeology and chromosomal rearrangements of wild relatives, an important source of genes for wheat improvement.
   To transfer agronomically important genes from wild relatives to bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) by induced homoeologous recombination, it is important to know the chromosomal relationships of the species involved. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to study chromosome structure. The genomes of allohexaploid bread wheat and other species from the Triticeae tribe are colinear to some extent, i.e., composed of homoeoloci at similar positions along the chromosomes, and with genic regions being highly conserved. To develop cytogenetic markers specific for genic regions of wheat homoeologs, we selected more than 60 full-length wheat cDNAs using BLAST against mapped expressed sequence tags and used them as FISH probes. Most probes produced signals on all three homoeologous chromosomes at the expected positions. We developed a wheat physical map with several cDNA markers located on each of the 14 homoeologous chromosome arms. The FISH markers confirmed chromosome rearrangements within wheat genomes and were successfully used to study chromosome structure and homoeology in wild Triticeae species. FISH analysis detected 1U-6U chromosome translocation in the genome of Aegilops umbellulata, showed colinearity between chromosome A of Ae. caudata and group-1 wheat chromosomes, and between chromosome arm 7S#3L of Thinopyrum intermedium and the long arm of the group-7 wheat chromosomes.

AB Stripe rust (or yellow rust), caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat. Characterization and utilization of novel resistant genes is the most effective, economic and environmentally friendly approach to controlling the disease. Wheat line LM168-1, which was derived from a cross between common wheat Chuannong 16 and Milan, has good adult-plant resistance to stripe rust, based on field tests over several years. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, LM168-1 was crossed with susceptible variety SY95-71. Parents and F1, F2, BC1 and F2:3 progenies were tested in 2009-2011 in a field inoculated with the predominant races of Pst in China. The genetic analysis showed that resistance to stripe rust in LM168-1 was controlled by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated yrLM168. Simple sequence repeat (SSR), resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance locus. Finally, a linkage group consisting of two SSR, four RGAP and five TRAP markers was constructed for yrLM168 with 102 F2 plants. The closest markers R1 and R2 flanked the resistance gene locus at 2.4 and 2.4 cM, respectively. Furthermore, two SSR markers Xwmc59 and Xwmc145 assigned the gene to chromosome 6A. Because yrLM168 confers high-level resistance to the predominant races of Pst in China, it should be useful in stripe rust resistance breeding programs. The closely linked markers can be used for rapidly transferring yrLM168 to wheat breeding populations.

AB Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is a major disease of wheat, and genetic resistance remains the best strategy for managing it. The resistance gene Lr34 has been key in the genetic management of wheat leaf rust worldwide. However, little is known about the geo-genetic diversity, history and origin of this unique gene. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity at the Lr34 locus of a world wheat germplasm collection. A total of 52 alleles were detected for the 10 Lr34 markers. On the basis of the Lr34-specific markers, the world collection was divided into five major haplotypes (H), of which H1 was consistently associated with the resistance phenotype Lr34+. Phenotypic data confirmed the susceptible phenotypes of H2, H3 and H4 and the susceptible or intermediate phenotype of H5. SNP12 (C/T) was the only mutation differentiating the resistant haplotype from the susceptible ones. Combined analysis of the 10 markers resulted in dividing the major haplotypes into 118 different sub-haplotypes. Structure and clustering analyses grouped them into two main clusters and seven sub-clusters. Variance between the main clusters represented the largest proportion of the total variation. H2, the only haplotype found in Aegilops tauschii, is the ancestral haplotype and H1 (Lr34+) likely arose after the advent of hexaploid wheat. Analysis of geographical distribution showed that H1 was more frequent in the Asian germplasm while H2 dominated the European germplasm. Lr34, a gain-of-function mutation, is hypothesized to have originated in Asia.

AB Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] accumulates large amounts of sugars in the stem parenchyma and can be used to manufacture sucrose and alcohol. Soluble acid invertase (SAI) plays an important role in sucrose accumulation in the sweet sorghum stem. Characterization of SAI genes and development of functional markers are important for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. Here, the full-length genomic DNA sequence of a SAI gene (SAI-1) was cloned by in silico cloning and experimentally validated. The SAI-1 gene comprises three exons and two introns, totaling 4,966 bp, with an open reading frame of 2,025 bp encoding a polypeptide of 674 amino acids. The protein encoded by SAI-1 (molecular weight 73.4 kDa) contains a glycosyl hydrolase family 32 conserved domain, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose. Four allelic variants at the SAI-1 locus, SAI-1a, SAI-1b, SAI-1c and SAI-1d (GenBank accession nos. JX535515, JX535516, JX535517 and JX535518), were identified in 165 sweet sorghum cultivars. A co-dominant marker, SBX1, was developed to discriminate these variants. The mean Brix value from cultivars with a 141-bp (SAI-1c) PCR product was higher than in cultivars with a 136-bp (SAI-1b) product, and the mean Brix value from cultivars with a 136-bp (SAI-1b) product was significantly higher than those with a 132-bp (SAI-1a) product. The results showed that a domain of ATTGA repeat sequences in the second intron might be an important regulatory site, and that the functional marker SBX1 was closely related to the Brix value, and could therefore be used in sweet sorghum breeding programs.

AB The cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line KTP116A developed at Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China, was sterile at temperatures below 18 A degrees C and fertile at temperatures above 20 A degrees C during Zadok's growth stages 45-52. The possibility of a two-line system has a promising future for hybrid wheat production. The present study describes morphological differences in pollen abortion behavior at different temperatures, and the genetics of the thermo-sensitive restorer gene(s) in line KTP116A. Cytological observations showed that abnormalities in development of male sterile anthers first appeared at the bi-nucleate stage. Only a few pollen grains go through the second mitosis to produce two sperm cells; most of those became abnormal pollen grains and shell structures without protoplast, confirming that the conversion from sterility to fertility in the CMS line was accompanied by changes in morphology and cytology. A BC1 population of 198 plants from a cross of male-sterile KTP116A and male fertile F-1 TP116B/WM5-5 was developed to study the genetic control of thermo-sensitive sterility. Chi squared tests on data from back-crossed populations revealed that two recessive genes, designated rfv (1) (sp) and rfv (2) , were responsible for sterility of line KTP116A. Sixteen of 712 SSR markers were polymorphic between the parents and bulks. Four SSR markers, viz. Xgwm11, Xgwm18, Xgwm413 and Xbarc137, were linked to thermo-sensitive gene rfv (1) (sp) on chromosome 1BS of T. spelta, and another four markers were linked to rfv (2) located on chromosome 2A. This thermo-sensitive male sterile line can be used for production of experimental hybrids in order to test levels of heterosis.

AB Background: Using the cross of wheat and maize is a very useful way to produce wheat haploid plants by chromosome elimination. Dwarf male sterile wheat (DMSW) and corn inducer are potential important germplasm for wheat breeding by recurrent selection and doubled haploid strategies. There is no report yet to achieve the haploid plants from DMSW induced by maize inbred line and especially the corn inducer.
   Results: Haploid plants of DMSW were successfully obtained in this study induced by both maize pollens of inducer line and normal inbred line. The efficiencies for wheat embryos formation and plantlets production induced by the two corn lines had no significant difference. All the eleven haploid wheat plants derived from the male sterile material were identified by botanic appearance, cytology, cytogenetics, and molecular markers. They were all haploid based on their guard cell length of 42.78-42.90 mu m compared with the diploid control of 71.52 mu m, and their chromosome number of 21 compared with the diploid control of 42. In addition, according to anthers, plant height, and molecular markers, the haploid plants were divided into two types. Eight of them showed dwarf, having no anthers, and the special band of Rht10, and the other three plants displayed normal plant height, having anthers, and not containing the special band of Rht10, indicating that they were originated from the MS2/Rht10 and ms2/rht10 female gametes, respectively.
   Conclusions: MS2/Rht10 haploid plants were successfully obtained in this study by using corn inducer and inbred line, and will be employed as candidate materials for the potential cloning of MS2 dominant male gene.

AB Background: Paspalum dilatatum Poir. (common name dallisgrass) is a native grass species of South America, with special relevance to dairy and red meat production. P. dilatatum exhibits higher forage quality than other C4 forage grasses and is tolerant to frost and water stress. This species is predominantly cultivated in an apomictic monoculture, with an inherent high risk that biotic and abiotic stresses could potentially devastate productivity. Therefore, advanced breeding strategies that characterise and use available genetic diversity, or assess germplasm collections effectively are required to deliver advanced cultivars for production systems. However, there are limited genomic resources available for this forage grass species.
   Results: Transcriptome sequencing using second-generation sequencing platforms has been employed using pooled RNA from different tissues (stems, roots, leaves and inflorescences) at the final reproductive stage of P. dilatatum cultivar Primo. A total of 324,695 sequence reads were obtained, corresponding to c. 102 Mbp. The sequences were assembled, generating 20,16(contigs of a combined length of 9,336,138 nucleotides. The contigs were BLAST analysed against the fully sequenced grass species of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica, Brachypodium distachyon, the closely related Sorghum bicolor and foxtail millet (Setaria italica) genomes as well as against the UniRef 90 protein database allowing a comprehensive gene ontology analysis to be performed. The contigs generated from the transcript sequencing were also analysed for the presence of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A total of 2,33(SSR motifs were identified within 1,98(contigs and corresponding primer pairs were designed. Empirical validation of a cohort of 96 SSRs was performed, with 34% being polymorphic between sexual and apomictic biotypes.
   Conclusions: The development of genetic and genomic resources for P. dilatatum will contribute to gene discovery and expression studies. Association of gene function with agronomic traits will significantly enable molecular breeding and advance germplasm enhancement.

AB Intergeneric crop plant hybrid lines with small-segment chromosome translocations are very useful in plant genetic research and breeding. In this study, to create small-segment chromosome translocations with beneficial agronomic characters, the progeny of wheat-rye substitution lines 5R/5A and 6R/6A were selected from generations F-2 to F-5 for rye-specific characteristics. A PCR primer and specific simple sequence repeat marker for rye were used in F-5 populations to detect rye chromatin and to amplify a specific chromosome band in six translocation lines (06-6-5, 06-6-6, 06-6-9, 6-26-1, 7-23, and 7-33). Fragment pSc119.1 cloned from 7-33 had 99% homology with the big ear gene sequence (GenBank AF512607.1) in wheat. The six lines were further characterized via pollen mother cell meiosis analysis for genetic stability, and chromosome C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization for rye chromatin. The results show that line 7-33 was still within the 5R/5A substitution lines and possessed the big ear gene. The other lines all contained small-segment rye chromosome translocations. The results indicated that substitution line hybridization is an effective method for creating small-segment chromosome translocations with useful agronomic traits. Trials for these six wheat-rye translocation lines are justified because they possess many important stably-inherited agronomic characters, including disease resistance and improved yield.

AB 3M(b) Triticum aestivum L. (Mv9kr1) - Aegilops biuncialis Vis. (MvGB642) addition lines were crossed with the Chinese Spring ph1b mutant genotype (CSph1b) to produce 3M(b)-wheat chromosome rearrangements. In the F-3 generation, 3M(b)(4B) substitution lines and 3M(b).4BS centric fusions were identified with in situ hybridization using repetitive and genomic DNA probes, and with SSR markers. Grain micronutrient analysis showed that the investigated Ae. biuncialis accession MvGB382 and the parental line MvGB642 are suitable gene sources for improving the grain micronutrient content of wheat, as they have higher K, Zn, Fe, and Mn contents. The results suggested that the Ae. biuncialis chromosome 3M(b) carries genes determining the grain micronutrient content, as the 3M(b).4BS centric fusion had significantly higher Zn and Mn contents compared with the recipient wheat cultivar. As yield-related traits, such as the number of tillers, the length of main spike, and spikelets per main spike, were similar in the 3M(b). BS centric fusion and the parental wheat genotype, it can be concluded that this line could be used in pre-breeding programs aimed at enriching elite wheat cultivars with essential micronutrients.

AB The effectiveness of molecular markers for the identification of leaf rust resistance genes Lr28, Lr35 and Lr47 transferred to common wheat from Ae. speltoides was assessed using samples of Triticum spp. and Aegilops spp. The markers Sr39F2/R3, BCD260F1/35R2 of the gene Lr35 and PS10 of the Lr47 gene were characterized by high efficiency and were revealed in the lines of common wheat containing these genes, and samples of Ae. speltoides species, the donor of these genes. The marker SCS421 of the Lr28 gene and the markers Sr39#22r, Sr39#50s, BE500705 of the Lr35/Sr39 genes turned out to be less specific. The marker SCS421 was amplified in the samples of the T. timopheevii species, line KS90WRC010 (Lr41), the cultivar of common wheat Pamyati Maystrenko, obtained using synthetic hexaploid T. timopheevii x Ae. tauschii and introgressive lines obtained using Ae. speltoides. The marker BE500705, which indicates the absence of the Lr35/Sr39 genes, was not revealed in the lines TcLr35 and MqSr39, in Ae. speltoides, Ae. tauschii and T. boeoticum (kk-61034, 61038). Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of amplification products obtained with the markers SCS421 and Sr39#22r indicated their low homology with TcLr28 and TcLr35. Using molecular markers, a different distribution of the Lr28 (77%), Lr35 (100%) and Lr47 (15%) genes in 13 studied samples of Ae. speltoides was shown. In introgressive lines derived from Ae. speltoides, contemporary Russian cultivars of common wheat and triticale the Lr28, Lr35, Lr47 genes were not revealed.

AB Triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) is a relatively new cereal crop. In Poland, triticale is grown on 12 % of arable land (http://www.stat.gov.pl). There is an increasing interest in its cultivation due to lowered production costs and increased adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. However, it has an insufficient tolerance to the presence of aluminum ions (Al3+) in the soil. The number of genes controlling aluminum tolerance in triticale and their chromosomal location is not known. Two F2 mapping biparental populations (MP1 and MP15) segregating for aluminum (Al) tolerance were tested with AFLP, SSR, DArT, and specific PCR markers. Genetic mapping enabled the construction of linkage groups representing chromosomes 7R, 5R and 2B. Obtained linkage groups were common for both mapping populations and mostly included the same markers. Composite interval mapping (CIM) allowed identification of a single QTL that mapped to the 7R chromosome and explained 25 % (MP1) and 36 % (MP15) of phenotypic variation. The B1, B26 and Xscm150 markers were 0.04 cM and 0.02 cM from the maximum of the LOD function in the MP1 and MP15, respectively and were highly associated with aluminum tolerance as indicated by Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test. Moreover, the molecular markers B1, B26, Xrems1162 and Xscm92, previously associated with the Alt4 locus that encoded an aluminum-activated malate transporter (ScALMT1) that was involved in Al tolerance in rye (Secale cereale) also mapped within QTL. Biochemical analysis of plants represented MP1 and MP15 mapping populations confirmed that the QTL located on 7R chromosome in both mapping populations is responsible for Al tolerance.

AB To establish a simple and rapid method for isolating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Brassica vegetables, the effects of different factors on mtDNA extraction were investigated firstly. A new protocol includes five steps: organelle isolation, deoxyribonuclease treatment, lysis, RNase treatment, and deproteinization. Results indicate that a 15 min-lysis time can achieve higher mtDNA yields from etiolated seedlings. Moreover, it is found that the inflorescence of the cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line is unfit for the isolation of mtDNA. The mtDNA isolated using this method is intact and pure, and can be used for further molecular analysis. Subsequently, the genomic and transcriptional differences of atps and coxs genes on the mitochondria between the petaloid-type CMS line and its maintainer line have been identified. RFLP analysis revealed that out of the five atps and three coxs genes, except of atp4 and cox3, the others mtDNA protein coding genes exhibited polymorphisms, respectively. This results suggest that atps and coxs genes are located in a long mtDNA fragment, and the mtDNA evolves rapidly in structure between the CMS line and its maintainer line in tuber muster. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression level of these genes in flower bud is higher than that of leaf and flower, and that, alternative splicing have been found among the atp6, atp8 and cox3 genes, respectively. Our results modified a efficient protocol for isolating the mtDNA, and provided some novel molecular markers indicating the CMS trait in tuber mustard. The comparative analysis presented in this study allows a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism on CMS in Brassica crops.

AB Leaf rust (LR) and yellow rust (YR), caused by Puccinia triticina and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, respectively, are important diseases of wheat. Quaiu 3, a common wheat line developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), is immune to YR in Mexico despite seedling susceptibility to predominant races. Quaiu 3 also shows immunity to LR in field trials and is known to possess the race-specific gene Lr42. A mapping population of 182 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed by crossing Quaiu 3 with susceptible Avocet-YrA and phenotyped with LR and YR in field trials for 2 years in Mexico. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with YR and LR resistance in the RILs were identified using Diversity Arrays Technology and simple sequence repeat markers. A large-effect QTL on the long arm of chromosome 2D explained 49-54 % of the phenotypic variation in Quaiu 3 and was designated as Yr54. Two additional loci on 1BL and 3BS explained 8-17 % of the phenotypic variation for YR and coincided with previously characterized adult plant resistance (APR) genes Lr46/Yr29 and Sr2/Yr30, respectively. QTL on 1DS and 1BL corresponding to Lr42 and Lr46/Yr29, respectively, contributed 60-71 % of the variation for LR resistance. A locus on 3D associated with APR to both diseases explained up to 7 % of the phenotypic variance. Additional Avocet-YrA-derived minor QTL were also detected for YR on chromosomes 1A, 3D, 4A, and 6A. Yr54 is a newly characterized APR gene which can be combined with other genes by using closely linked molecular markers.

In this study, one rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to determine the genetic characteristics of SD at the early (4 weeks after heading), middle (5 weeks after heading) and late (6 weeks after heading) development stages. The level of SD decreased with the process of seed development, and the SD was significantly affected by the heading date (HD) and temperature at the early and middle development stages. A total of eight additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for SD were identified at three development stages, and more QTLs were expressed at the early and late development stages. Among them, four, one and three additive QTLs were identified at the early, middle and late development stages, respectively. Epistatic QTLs and QTL-by-development interactions were detected by the joint analysis of multi-development phenotypic values, and one additive and two epistatic QTLs were identified. The phenotypic variation of SD explained by each additive, epistatic QTL and QTL x development interaction ranged from 8.0 to 13.5 %, 0.7 to 3.9 % and 1.3 to 2.8 %, respectively. One major QTL qSD7.1 for SD was tightly linked to the major QTL qHD7.4 for HD, which might be applied to reveal the relationship of SD and HD. By comparing chromosomal positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, five additive QTLs qSD1.1, qSD2.1, qSD2.2, qSD4.1 and qSD4.2 might represent novel genes. The best three cross combinations for the development of RIL populations were predicted to improve SD. The selected RILs and the identified QTLs might be applicable to improve the rice pre-harvest sprouting tolerance by the marker-assisted selection approach.

AB Key message This manuscript describes the chromosomal location of a new source of stripe rust resistance in wheat. DNA markers closely linked with the resistance locus were identified and validated.
   A wheat landrace, AUS27858, from the Watkins collection showed high levels of resistance against Australian pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. It was reported to carry two genes for stripe rust resistance, tentatively named YrAW1 and YrAW2. One hundred seeds of an F3 line (HSB#5515; YrAW1yrAW1) that showed monogenic segregation for stripe rust response were sown and harvested individually to generate monogenically segregating population (MSP) #5515. Stripe rust response variation in MSP#5515 conformed to segregation at a single locus. Bulked segregant analysis using high-throughput DArT markers placed YrAW1 in chromosome 4AL. MSP#5515 was advanced to F6 and phenotyped for detailed mapping. Novel wheat genomic resources including chromosome-specific sequence and genome zipper were employed to develop markers specific for the long arm of chromosome 4A. These markers were used for further saturation of the YrAW1 carrying region. YrAW1 was delimited by 3.7 cM between markers owm45F3R3 and sun104. Since there was no other stripe rust resistance gene located in chromosome 4AL, YrAW1 was formally named Yr51. Reference stock for Yr51 was lodged at the Australian Winter Cereal Collection, Tamworth, Australia and it was accessioned as AUS91456. Marker sun104 was genotyped on a set of Australian and Indian wheat cultivars and was shown to lack the resistance-linked sun104-225 bp allele. Marker sun104 is currently being used for marker-assisted backcrossing of Yr51 in Australian and Indian wheat backgrounds.

AB Key message Ion beam mutations can be efficiently isolated and deployed for functional comparison of homoeologous loci in polyploid plants, and Glu - 1 loci differ substantially in their contribution to wheat gluten functionality.
   To efficiently conduct genetic analysis, it is beneficial to have multiple types of mutants for the genes under investigation. Here, we demonstrate that ion beam-induced deletion mutants can be efficiently isolated for comparing the function of homoeologous loci of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). Through fragment analysis of PCR products from M-2 plants, ion beam mutants lacking homoeologous Glu-A1, Glu-B1 or Glu-D1 loci, which encode high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) and affect gluten functionality and end-use quality of common wheat, could be isolated simultaneously. Three deletion lines missing Glu-A1, Glu-B1 or Glu-D1 were developed from the original mutants, with the Glu-1 genomic regions deleted in these lines estimated using newly developed DNA markers. Apart from lacking the target HMW-GSs, the three lines all showed decreased accumulation of low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GSs) and increased amounts of gliadins. Based on the test data of five gluten and glutenin macropolymer (GMP) parameters obtained with grain samples harvested from two environments, we conclude that the genetic effects of Glu-1 loci on gluten functionality can be ranked as Glu-D1 > Glu-B1 > Glu-A1. Furthermore, it is suggested that Glu-1 loci contribute to gluten functionality both directly (by promoting the formation of GMP) and indirectly (through keeping the balance among HMW-GSs, LMW-GSs and gliadins). Finally, the efficient isolation of ion beam mutations for functional comparison of homoeologous loci in polyploid plants and the usefulness of Glu-1 deletion lines for further studying the contribution of Glu-1 loci to gluten functionality are discussed.

AB In order to evaluate the genetic effects of Rht-5 dwarfing gene on agronomic traits in common wheat, F-2 population and 32 F-2:3 lines derived from the cross between Jinmai47 (rht-5) and Marfed M (Rht-5) along with the two parents were grown in the winter wheat growing seasons of 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, respectively. The F-2 population formed the mapping population and their phenotypic and genotypic data were merged for QTL mapping. The dwarf and tall individuals in the F-2 population were selected to compose the F-2:3 lines. Analysis of variance in the F-2 population and F-2:3 lines showed highly significant differences among individuals or lines for all of traits studied, except for biomass and grain yield. In general, in the background of Jinmai47, dwarfing gene Rht-5 was associated with a plant height reduction of 25.84%, delaying heading date by 1 day, increasing the number of fertile tillers plant(-1) by 37.39%, while reducing the number of spikelets spike(-1) and number of grains spike(-1) by 8.07% and 22.31%, respectively. Individuals with earlier heading date, longer spikes, more spikelets spike(-1), and more grains spike(-1) could be observed in the dwarf lines when compared to the dwarf parent. Plant height showed highly positive and significant correlation with peduncle length (0.88), spike length (0.80), number of spikelets spike(-1) (0.63), number of grains spike-1 (0.64), biomass (0.47), grain yield (0.56) and harvest index (0.37), whereas it had negative and highly significant correlation with the number of fertile tillers plant(-1) (-0.64). A partial chromosomal linkage map was constructed with three polymorphic markers based on their genotypes in the F-2 population. Using composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis, four QTLs were detected for plant height, heading date, peduncle length and number of grains spike(-1) and accounted for up to 11.82%, 8.02%, 10.32% and 15.65% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. The results of the current study could be useful for proper use of Rht-5 dwarfing gene in breeding programs to improve lodging tolerance, yield potential in wheat and increase efficiency of marker assisted selection for agronomic traits.

AB Pear is a fruit species with worldwide distribution belonging to the Rosaceae family. In this study, transcriptomes of 12 different tissues of pear were newly assembled, with a total of 17,353 SSR loci identified. Within these, repetitive sequences with dinucleotide and trinucleotide motifs were more abundant than other types. We developed 194 EST-SSR makers from the assembled sequences to test on seven pear varieties from different genetic backgrounds, on which 132 EST-SSR primers had amplicons. There were 108 primers with dinucleotide and trinucleotide motifs detecting a total of 311 alleles, with an average per primer of 2.88 and 2.86, respectively. These had better quality than primers with tetranucleotides, pentanucleotides, and hexanucleotides. Fifty polymorphic markers divided 36 pear genotypes into two groups with a similarity coefficient of 0.62. Results showed that Japanese pears had a comparatively close relationship with Chinese pears, indicating the great potential of the novel EST-SSR makers in future evaluations of pear germplasm. Furthermore, 54 EST-SSR markers were selected to test transferability to 96 other Rosaceae cultivars from eight species, including Japanese apricot, plum, apricot, peach, cherry, apple, strawberry, and loquat. Seventeen EST-SSR primers had PCR amplification products in at least one of the 96 accessions, with the highest transferability was from pear to apple at 29.63 %. Transferability from pear to Japanese apricot, plum, apricot, peach, cherry, strawberry, and loquat was 9.26, 14.81, 11.11, 12.96, 5.56, 3.7, and 12.96 %, respectively. Therefore, the newly developed EST-SSR markers can contribute to exploring the genetic relationship, evolution and comparative genomics, and gene introgressions in the Rosaceae family.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) poses a challenge for wheat breeders worldwide; there are limited sources of resistance and the genetic basis for resistance is not well understood. In the mid-1980s, a shuttle breeding and germplasm exchange program launched between CIMMYT-Mexico and China, enabled the incorporation of FHB resistance from Chinese bread wheat germplasm into CIMMYT wheat. Most of the Chinese wheat materials conserved in the CIMMYT germplasm bank had not been fully characterized for FHB reaction under Mexican environments, until 2009, when 491 Chinese bread wheat lines were evaluated in a FHB screening nursery in Mexico, and 304 (61.9 %) showed FHB indices below 10 %. Subsequent testing occurred in 2010 for plant height (PH), days to heading (DH), and leaf rust response. In 2012, 140 elite lines with good agronomic types were further evaluated for field FHB reaction and deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation. Most of the tested lines showed good resistance: 116 (82.9 %) entries displayed FHB indices lower than 10 %, while 89 (63.6 %) had DON contents lower than 1.0 ppm. Significant negative correlations were observed between FHB traits (FHB index, DON content, and Fusarium damaged kernels) and PH, DH, and anther extrusion. A subset of 102 elite entries was selected for haplotyping using markers linked to 10 well known FHB quantitative trait loci (QTL). 57 % of the lines possessed the same 2DL QTL marker alleles as Wuhan 1 or CJ 9306, and 26.5 % had the same 3BS QTL allele as Sumai 3. The remaining known QTL were of low frequency. These materials, especially those with none of the above tested resistance QTL(26.5 %), could be used in breeding programs as new resistance sources possessing novel genes for FHB resistance and DON tolerance.

AB Toxigenic Fusarium species are common pathogens of wheat and other cereals worldwide. In total, 449 wheat heads from six localities in Poland, heavily infected with Fusarium during 2009 season, were examined for Fusarium species identification. F. culmorum was the most common species (72.1% on average) with F. graminearum and F. avenaceum the next most commonly observed, but much less frequent (13.4 and 12.5% respectively). F. cerealis was found in 1.8% of all samples, and F. tricinctum was found only in one sample (0.2%). Subsequent quantification of the three major mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and moniliformin) in grain and chaff fractions with respect to associated prevailing pathogen species uncovered the following patterns. Moniliformin (MON) was found in low amounts in all samples with F. avenaceum present. In contrast, deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) were the contaminants of F. culmorum- and F. graminearum-infected heads. The highest concentration of DON was recorded in grain sample collected in Radzikw (77 A mu g g(-1)). High temperatures in Central Poland during July and August accompanied with high rainfall in July were responsible for this high DON accumulation. Trichothecene, zearalenone, enniatin and beauvericin chemotypes were identified among 21 purified isolates using gene-specific PCR markers.

AB Background: The cultivated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) possesses unique flour quality, which can be processed into many end-use food products such as bread, pasta, chapatti (unleavened flat bread), biscuit, etc. The present wheat varieties require improvement in processing quality to meet the increasing demand of better quality food products. However, processing quality is very complex and controlled by many genes, which have not been completely explored. To identify the candidate genes whose expressions changed due to variation in processing quality and interaction (quality x development), genome-wide transcriptome studies were performed in two sets of diverse Indian wheat varieties differing for chapatti quality. It is also important to understand the temporal and spatial distributions of their expressions for designing tissue and growth specific functional genomics experiments.
   Results: Gene-specific two-way ANOVA analysis of expression of about 55 K transcripts in two diverse sets of Indian wheat varieties for chapatti quality at three seed developmental stages identified 236 differentially expressed probe sets (10-fold). Out of 236, 110 probe sets were identified for chapatti quality. Many processing quality related key genes such as glutenin and gliadins, puroindolines, grain softness protein, alpha and beta amylases, proteases, were identified, and many other candidate genes related to cellular and molecular functions were also identified. The ANOVA analysis revealed that the expression of 56 of 110 probe sets was involved in interaction (quality x development). Majority of the probe sets showed differential expression at early stage of seed development i.e. temporal expression. Meta-analysis revealed that the majority of the genes expressed in one or a few growth stages indicating spatial distribution of their expressions. The differential expressions of a few candidate genes such as pre-alpha/beta-gliadin and gamma gliadin were validated by RT-PCR. Therefore, this study identified several quality related key genes including many other genes, their interactions (quality x development) and temporal and spatial distributions.
   Conclusions: The candidate genes identified for processing quality and information on temporal and spatial distributions of their expressions would be useful for designing wheat improvement programs for processing quality either by changing their expression or development of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers.

AB We evaluated and compared 2 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extraction methods in terms of DNA quality and success of subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications from etiolated leaves of wheat crop (Triticum aestivum). mtDNA extraction is difficult because the presence of metabolites interfere with DNA isolation procedures and downstream applications such as DNA restriction, amplification, and cloning. The method (with modification) involved inactivation of genomic DNA by DNase I enzyme, RNA by RNase enzyme, contaminant proteins by using proteinase K, and precipitation of polysaccharides in the presence of a high salt concentration. The DNase I and RNA enzyme ratio was adjusted to 10:8 mu L. The purity of mtDNA was confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic, mitochondrial, and chloroplast (rbcL) gene. The mitochondrial COXIII gene of 400 bp was amplified; the beta-actin and chloroplast genes were not amplified. A(260)/A(280) (1.89) and A(260)/A(230) (2.07) ratios were calculated using a spectrophotometer. The isolated mtDNA was amenable to amplification and restriction digestion. The technique is fast, reproducible, and suitable for PCR-based markers.

AB Retrotransposons (RTN) make a significant contribution to the size, organization and genetic diversity of their host genomes. Several RTN families have been identified in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and other closely related species. In the current research, integration activity and insertional polymorphism of the RTNs CARE1, Tms1Ret1, TPS and LORE were studied in 64 chickpea accessions collected in Iran using inter retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) and retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) techniques. Results indicated that all RTNs studied, are transpositionally active in chickpea genome and amplified scorable and polymorphic banding pattern. Among the RTN families used, the highest percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) was produced by TPS family (81.82%). Totally, 129 loci were amplified using 18 IRAP and REMAP primers which 83 (64.34%) were polymorphic. The Dice genetic similarity coefficients among accessions ranged from 0.84 (accessions Tj48 and Ba4) to 0.98 (accessions Ka30 and Urm61), averaging 0.93. The parameters of expected heterozygosity (He), Shannon's information index (I) and number of effective alleles (Ne) were the highest for Urmia accessions. Cluster analysis based on UPGMA algorithm and Dice similarity coefficient categorized the 64 accessions in 7 main groups. The mean Fst values of all groups except for groups IV and VII, were lower than 0.20, demonstrating no clear differentiation among the groups, no genetic structure of the studied chickpea collection and probably occurrences of gene flow among the origins. In conclusion, although RTN-based markers were able to differentiate the chickpea accessions but the measured relative genetic similarity among accessions were not correlated with geographical distances between places of their origins.

AB Stripe rust (yellow rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat throughout the world. H9020-1-6-8-3 is a translocation line originally developed from interspecific hybridization between wheat line 7182 and Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng and is resistant to most Pst races in China. To identify the resistance gene(s) in the translocation line, H9020-1-6-8-3 was crossed with susceptible cultivar Mingxian 169, and seedlings of the parents, F-1, F-2, F-3, and BC1 generations were tested with prevalent Chinese Pst race CYR32 under controlled greenhouse conditions. The results indicated that there is a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrH9020a, conferring resistance to CYR32. The resistance gene was mapped by the F-2 population from Mingxian 169/H9020-1-6-8-3. It was linked to six microsatellite markers, including Xbarc196, Xbarc202, Xbarc96, Xgpw43 72, Xbarc21, and Xgdm141, flanked by Xbarc96 and Xbarc202 with at 4.5 and 8.3 cM, respectively. Based on the chromosomal locations of these markers and the test of Chinese Spring (CS) nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic lines, the gene was assigned to chromosome 6D. According to the origin and the chromosomal location, YrH9020a might be a new resistance gene to stripe rust. The flanking markers linked to YrH9020a could be useful for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs.

AB Wheat lines which possess resistance to leaf rust were developed from the cultivar crosses between bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and wild cereal species: jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host), tausch's goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii Coss.), wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides Koern.) and synthetic species Triticum erebuni Gandil. Resistance of breeding lines was examined at the seedling stage of wheat plants after artificial inoculation. Resistance genes Lr21, Lr22a, Lr24 (TIBL.1BS-3Ae#IL), Lr32, Lr34, Lr39, Lr42, Lr53 and T1AL.1RS were identified by a molecular analysis using sequence-tagged sites (STS) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Comparison of data of phytopathological evaluation and molecular-genetic analysis of breeding lines revealed that leaf rust resistance was conferred by a combination of several genes. The combination of genes Lr24+Lr34+T1AL.IRS conferred resistance, Lr24+Lr34+Lr21, T1AL.1RS+Lr24 and Lr21+T1AL.1RS+Lr24 conferred resistance and moderate resistance.

AB The introduction of genetic variation from wild and cultivated Triticeae species has been a long-standing approach for wheat improvement. Dasypyrum breviaristatum species harbor novel and agronomically important genes for resistance against multi-fungal diseases. The development of new wheat-D. breviaristatum introgression lines offers chances for the identification of stripe rust resistance gene(s). A wheat line, D11-5, was selected from a cross between wheat line MY11 and wheat-D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid TDH-2. It was characterized by FISH and PCR-based molecular markers. Chromosome counting revealed that the D11-5 line shows a hexaploid set of 2n = 6x = 42 chromosomes. FISH analysis using the Dasypyrum repetitive sequence pDb12H as a probe demonstrated that D11-5 contained a pair of D. breviaristatum chromosomes, while FISH with wheat D-genomic repetitive sequences revealed that the chromosome 2D was absent in D11-5. The functional molecular markers confirmed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosomes belong to the homoeologous group 2, indicating that D11-5 was a 2V(b) (2D) disomic substitution line. Field resistance showed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosomes 2V(b) were responsible for the stripe rust resistance at the adult plant stage. FISH, C-banding, and PCR-based molecular marker analysis indicated that the chromosome 2V(b) of D. breviaristatum was completely different from the chromosome 2V of D. villosum. The identified wheat-D. breviaristatum chromosome substitution line D11-5 may be applied to produce agronomically desirable stripe rust resistance germplasm. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Expressed sequence tags (EST) are potential source for the development of genic microsatellite markers, gene discovery, comparative genomics, and other genomic studies. In the present study, 7630 ESTs were examined from NCBI for SSR identification and characterization. A total of 263 SSRs were identified with an average density of one SSR/4.2 kb (3.4% frequency). Analysis revealed that trinucleotide repeats (47.52%) were most abundant followed by tetranucleotide (19.77%), dinucleotide (19.01%), pentanucleotide (9.12%), and hexanucleotide repeats (4.56%). Functional annotation was done through homology search and gene ontology, and 35 EST-SSRs were selected. Primer pairs were designed for evaluation of cross transferability and polymorphism among 11 plants belonging to five different families. Total 402 alleles were generated at 155 loci with an average of 2.6 alleles/locus and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.15 to 0.92 with an average of 0.75. The cross transferability ranged from 34.84% to 98.06% in different plants, with an average of 67.86%. Thus, the validation study of annotated 35 EST-SSR markers which correspond to particular metabolic activity revealed polymorphism and evolutionary nature in different families of Angiospermic plants.

AB The first step towards the biofortification of edible portions of crop species with improved nutritional value is to understand the genetic diversity available to breeders in germplasm collections. A faba bean germplasm (129 landraces and 4 cultivars) from diverse geographic regions of Turkey was assessed for micro- and macro element contents of seeds. The results showed high diversity in open-pollinated faba bean germplasm for contents of N (27.5-93.3 g kg(-1)), P (1.24-4.89 g kg(-1)), K (4.5-19.3 g kg(-1)), Fe (29.7-96.3 mg kg(-1)), Mn (15.5-29.2 mg kg(-1)), Cu (10.3-33.0 mg kg(-1)), and Zn (10.4-49.3 mg kg(-1)). Meanwhile, the ranges of mineral elements in the landraces were significantly higher than those in the commercial cultivars. Concentrations of these mineral elements were significantly and positively correlated with each other. Principal component analysis clearly split the faba bean landraces into 2 groups and the first 2 principal components accounted around 70.91% of the total variations. These findings indicate a wide range of variations for the investigated minerals in the Turkish gene pool that can provide a good source of diversity to use in faba bean biofortification for increased levels of available mineral elements and better yield.

AB The regulation of the majority of cold-regulated genes in plants is mediated by CBF (C-repeat binding factors) transcription factor family. Natural differences in frost tolerance (FT) of wheat have been mapped to the Fr-2 (Frost Resistance-2) locus on chromosome group 5 and are associated with variation in threshold induction temperatures and/or transcript levels of CBF genes.
   This study used real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to compare the relative expression levels of four T. aestivum CBF genes (TaCBF15.2, TaCBFA19, TaCBFA2 and TaCBFD21) in crown tissue of two Bulgarian hexaploid winter wheat cultivars (Milena and Russalka) with distinct levels of low-temperature (LT) tolerance but same vernalization requirement, and the spring cultivar Chinese Spring.
   The transcription profiles of the selected TaCBF genes showed that they are induced by cold treatment at 2 degrees C. Analysis of transcript abundance revealed that the four TaCBF genes were expressed at higher levels in the frost tolerant Milena than in the susceptible Russalka. Largest differences (fivefold and fourfold) in expression levels between both winter cultivars were observed in two of the analysed genes, TaCBF15.2 and TaCBFA19, respectively. The higher steady-state expression levels of TaCBF genes before the onset of the LT treatment in Milena, combined with stronger induction by cold treatment, suggest that these molecular responses to LT are associated with superior FT development capacity.
   The results expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LT acclimation in Bulgarian wheat and can be used for development of functional markers for improvement of FT wheat-breeding programmes.

AB Understanding the genetic mechanism underlying folate biosynthesis and accumulation in rice would be beneficial for breeding high folate content varieties as a cost-effective approach to addressing widespread folate deficiency in developing countries. In this study, the inheritance of rice grain folate content was investigated in the Lemont/Teqing recombinant inbred lines and the Koshihikari/Kasalath//Koshihikari backcross inbred lines. 264 F-12 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and 182 BC1F10 backcross inbred lines (BILs) with their parents planted in randomized complete blocks with two replicates in 2010, and RILs harvested in 2008 were used for QTL detection using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method. In the RIL population, two QTLs, denoted by qQTF-3-1 and qQTF-3-2 (QTF, quantitative total folate), explaining 7.8% and 11.1-15.8% of the folate content variation were detected in one or two years, respectively. In the BIL population, a QTL, denoted by qQTF-3-3, was detected, explaining 25.3% of the variation in folate content. All the positive alleles for higher folate content were from the high-folate parents, i.e., Teqing and Kasalath. The known putative folate biosynthesis genes do not underlie the QTLs detected in this study and therefore may be novel loci affecting folate content in milled rice. QTLs identified in this study have potential value for marker assisted breeding for high-folate rice variety.

AB Genetic manipulation using linear DNA was applied to the common wheat variety Xindong No. 26 via particle bombardment with the aim to improve bread-making quality of flour. Initially, 2 biolistic parameters, helium pressure and target distance, were optimized using plasmid pAHC25. We transformed wheat immature embryo scutella with the linear 1Dx5 gene without selectable markers. The highest transient beta-glucuronidase expression was obtained when scuttles were bombarded at 1100 psi with a 9-cm target distance. Using the optimized parameters, the transformation of the common wheat variety Xindong No. 26 was carried out using the linear 1Dx5. Three transgenic plants were identified from 1003 transgenic plants, yielding a transformation frequency of 0.4%. A sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed that the 1Dx5 gene was expressed in 4 T1 seeds of the transgenic plants. These experiments indicate the possibility of obtaining marker-free transgenic wheat plants via particle bombardment using the minimal gene cassettes with the particle bombardment parameters.

TI Registration of Near-Isogenic Winter Wheat Germplasm Contrasting in Fhb1

LA English
DT Article
ID MARKERS
AB The Chinese wheat germplasm Ning7840 (Triticum aestivum L.) contains Fhb1, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance that explains as much as 53% of the phenotypic variation in segregating populations. Ning7840 has been widely used as a resistant parent in breeding programs worldwide, but because of its poor adaptation in the United States, its progenies usually exhibit reduced grain yield due to the transfer of undesirable genes from Ning7840. The development of five near-isogenic lines (NILs: 'Clark'*7/Ning7840) (NIL75, Reg. No. GS-174, PI 668559; NIL78, Reg. No. GS-175, PI 668560; NIL80, Reg. No. GS-176, PI 668561; NIL90, Reg. No. GS-177, PI 668562; NIL98, Reg. No. GS-178, PI 668563) contrasting in Fhb1 alleles was intended to overcome this potential limitation. Marker-assisted backcrossing was used to develop the NILs. Approximately 2000 BC7F2 plants from the backcross of Ning7840 by Clark (recurrent parent) were screened with two Fhb1-flanking markers (Xgwm533 and Xgwm493), and selected BC7F3 families were evaluated for FHB resistance in greenhouses. Both genotypic and phenotypic data confirm the presence of Fhb1 in the four resistant NILs and absence in the one susceptible NIL. All resistant NILs had significantly higher FHB resistance and lower deoxynivalenol content than Clark and the susceptible NIL but yield similar to Clark (P = 0.295). Marker-assisted backcross efficiently transferred Fhb1 into U.S. hard winter wheat without transferring undesirable traits from Ning7840, and these Fhb1 NILs should be useful parents for effective use of Fhb1 in U.S. winter wheat.

AB Modern spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars are typically of semidwarf growth habit and have higher yield potential than their predecessors. Since the introduction of reduced height alleles, breeders have selected for higher grain yield and improvements in other traits. The objective of this project was to determine the genetic basis for differences between a modern spring wheat cultivar 'McNeal' with Rht-D1b for semidwarf habit and a historically important standard height cultivar 'Thatcher'. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population with 160 lines, including 80 in each height class, was tested in five environments in Montana. The Rht-D1 locus explained 90% of the height variation. The Rht-D1b allele had positive pleiotropic effects on grain yield and productive tiller number, explaining 73 and 33% of the respective variation. Negative pleiotropic effects occurred for grain protein, seed weight, and test weight, as Rht-D1 explained 42, 24, and 7% of the variation within the RIL. Favorable alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of lesser effect than Rht-D1 were more often contributed by McNeal for seed size and test weight than by Thatcher. A total of 17 epistatic interactions were observed, of which nine involved Rht-D1. Our results indicate that alleles for semidwarf habit explain most of the improvement in grain yield. Selection of favorable alleles at other loci has helped to mitigate negative pleiotropic effects of Rht-D1b. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis of wheat improvement through breeding.

AB Current methods for genomewide selection do not distinguish between known major genes and random genomewide markers. My objectives were to determine if explicitly modeling the effects of known major genes affects the response to genomewide selection, and to identify situations in which considering major genes as having fixed effects is helpful. Simulation experiments showed that having a fixed effect for a major gene became more advantageous as the percentage of genetic variance (V-G) explained by a major gene (R-2) increased and as the heritability on an entry-mean basis (h(2)) increased. With R-2 = 50% and h(2) = 0.80, the relative efficiency (based on selection gains in Cycle 4) with a major gene having a fixed versus random effect was 112-121%. Specifying a fixed effect for a single major gene was never disadvantageous except with R-2 < 10%. With h(2) >= 0.50, specifying a fixed versus random effect for a single major gene had little effect on prediction accuracy in Cycle 0. However, prediction accuracy in later cycles declined more rapidly when a major gene had a random effect instead of a fixed effect. The results with L = 2 or 3 major genes were similar to those with one major gene. In contrast, the usefulness of gene information was low with L = 10 major genes. Overall, major genes should be fitted as having fixed effects in genomewide selection when only a few major genes are present and each major gene accounts for >= 10% of V-G.

AB Seed size and shape are important traits that have been altered during domestication and are monitored in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs because they may impact yield and milling quality. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed morphology were mapped in two doubled-haploid (DH) wheat populations using three seed axes and elliptic Fourier descriptors of shape. In the Synthetic W7984 x Opata M85 (SynOpDH) population, 31 QTL were detected on all chromosomes except 3D, 4D, 5D, 6B, and 7B. Seed shape QTL in SynOpDH were independent of genes Q, Gpc-B1, Ser5B, S1, S2, S3, and markers for rice (Oryza sativa L.) GW2 and GS3. Environmentally stable QTL on 1A and 2D, as well as a pleiotropic QTL on 5A were detected. QTL on chromosome 1A conditioned uniformly widened grains, 2D affected width, and 5A width and thickness. In the Cayuga x Caledonia DH population, 30 QTL affecting kernel morphology were detected on all chromosomes except 3A, 5D, 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B. The most significant QTL in this population were on 3D affecting seed length and on 1D and 3B affecting uniform widening. Marker-assisted selection of these QTL for complex dimensions of seed shape may assist in breeding cultivars with improved yield or quality.

AB Native perennial grasses have potential as low-input biomass feedstocks. Basin wildrye [Leymus cinereus (Scribn. & Merr.) A. Love] is the largest native grass in western North America but is susceptible to defoliation. Creeping wildrye [Leymus triticoides (Buckley) Pilg.] is a shorter less productive grass with durable rhizomes and higher forage quality. Two creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations derived from interspecific hybrids were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling plant height, rhizome spreading, flowering, postanthesis biomass yield, cellulosic fiber, lignin, and protein traits using a linkage map comprising 376 expressed sequence tags and 423 other DNA markers. Biomass yields of the F-1 hybrids and pseudo-backcross populations were significantly greater than creeping wildrye with some genotypes nearly equal to or greater than basin wildrye. Rhizome spreading and forage quality of the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations were significantly greater than basin wildrye. Six of nine plant height QTL overlap with biomass QTL. Three flowering QTL detected in both populations overlap with fiber QTL. Plant height and flowering QTL were aligned to genes controlling dwarfing, photoperiod response, and vernalization in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) using the Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. genome reference sequence. Evidence suggests that genetic mechanisms controlling plant height and flowering are conserved among temperate grasses and reveals pathways for improving biomass production and forage quality.

AB To understand the relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the waxy gene and starch parameters in common rye, we performed sequence characterization, enzyme activity testing, amylopectin/amylose ratio evaluation, starch property testing, and correlation analysis. Specific primers were used to clone waxy from 20 rye cultivars. Sequence analysis showed that waxy was 2852 bp, including 11 exons, and sequence similarity across the 20 cultivars was over 98%. The Waxy protein showed > 95% similarity with those from wheat, rice, and barley, the closest genetic relationship being with wheat Wx-A type. Waxy had multiple SNPs, most of which were located in the exons. Amino acid variants were found to be mainly distributed in the catalytic domain in an imbalanced state. Multi-factor correlation analysis revealed significant correlation among starch pasting parameters in rye flour. The Waxy protein activity was significantly negatively correlated with the amylose content and amylopectin/amylose ratio. However, pasting parameters, Waxy enzyme activity, and amylopectin/amylose content ratio were not correlated. The correlation of SNPs, the key catalytic site of Waxy, with starch parameters and enzyme activity suggested that both starch pasting parameters and Waxy protein activity were influenced by No. 260 amino acid (aa). Further, the 141 and 152 aa loci were found in the enzyme-catalyzing domain of Waxy. Interestingly, Waxy enzyme activity was also influenced by the 363 aa locus in the pliable region. These results provide important theoretical regarding the high-throughput quality identification of noodle starch, functional studies, directional selection, and molecular markers of wheat Wx subunits.

AB For map-based cloning of genes conferring important traits in the hexaploid wheat line 92R137, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, including two sublibraries, was constructed using the genomic DNA of 92R137 digested with restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI. The BAC library was composed of total 765,696 clones, of which 390,144 were from the HindIII digestion and 375,552 from the BamHI digestion. Through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of 453 clones randomly selected from the HindIII sublibrary and 573 clones from the BamHI sublibrary, the average insert sizes were estimated as 129 and 113 kb, respectively. Thus, the HindIII sublibrary was estimated to have a 3.01-fold coverage and the BamHI sublibrary a 2.53-fold coverage based on the estimated hexaploid wheat genome size of 16,700Mb. The 765,696 clones were arrayed in 1,994 384-well plates. All clones were also arranged into plate pools and further arranged into 5-dimensional (5D) pools. The probability of identifying a clone corresponding to any wheat DNA sequence (such as gene Yr26 for stripe rust resistance) from the library was estimated to be more than 99.6%. Through polymerase chain reaction screening the 5D pools with Xwe173, a marker tightly linked to Yr26, six BAC clones were successfully obtained. These results demonstrate that the BAC library is a valuable genomic resource for positional cloning of Yr26 and other genes of interest.

AB Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) are of great importance in processing quality and participate in the formation of polymers in wheat. In this study, eight new LMW-GS alleles were isolated from Chinese wheat landraces (Triticum aestivum L.) and designated as Glu-A3-1a, Glu-A3-1b, Glu-B3-1a, Glu-B3-1b, Glu-B3-1c, Glu-D3-1a, Glu-D3-1b, and Glu-D3-1c, which were located at the Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 loci, respectively. Based on the proteins encoded, the number of deduced amino acids of Glu-B3 alleles was approximately 50 more than those of Glu-A3 and Glu-D3 alleles. The first cysteine of Glu-A3 and Glu-D3 alleles was located at the N-terminal domain, while that of Glu-B3 alleles was found in the repetitive domain, which may lead to the different functioning in forming disulfide bonds. All the eight genes were LMW-m types and the new allele of Glu-B3-1a which had nine cysteine residues may be the desirable LMW-GS gene for improving bread-making quality.

AB In this study, the authentic high molecular weight glutenin (HMW-GS) allele Glu-B1 h encoding for subunits 1Bx14 and 1By15 from German bread wheat cultivars Hanno and Imbros was identified and cross-verified by a suite of established protein analysis technologies, including sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The complete encoding sequences were isolated by allele-specific PCR, and consist of 2367 bp for 1Bx14 and 2151 bp for 1By15 and encode 789 and 717 amino acid residues, respectively. The deduced molecular masses of two subunit genes were 82 340.13 Da and 74 736.13 Da, corresponding well to those determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The presence and authenticity of 1Bx14 and 1By15 subunits were further confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and heterologous expression in E. coli. Comparative analysis demonstrated that 1Bx14 possessed one deletion and 20 single-nucleotide polymorphism variations compared with seven other Glu-B1 x-type HMW-GS genes that mainly resulted from C-T substitutions, whereas compared with five other Glu-B1 y-type HMW-GS genes, 1By15 displayed few variations. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete coding sequences of the published HMW-GS genes showed that 1Bx14 had a high divergence with other 1Bx subunit genes, whereas 1By15 displayed greater similarity with 1By20. A possible evolutionary route for 1Bx14 gene formation is proposed, which might have resulted from an intra-strand illegitimate recombination event that occurred ~1.32 million years ago.

AB Laminaria and Saccharina have recently been recognized as two independent clades from the former genus Laminaria. Traditional morphological taxonomy is being challenged by molecular evidence from both nucleus and plastid. Intensive work is in great demand from the perspective of genome colinearity. In this study, 118 sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were screened for phylogenetic analyses, 29 based on genome sequences, while 89 were based on expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. EST-based STS marker development (29.37%) had an effi ciency twice as high as genome-sequence-based development (9.48%) as a result of high conservation of gene transcripts among the relative species. S. ochotensis, S. religiosa, S. japonica, and L. hyperborea showed great homogeneity in all 118 STS markers. Our result supports the view that the diversifi cation between the genera Saccharina and Laminaria was a more recent event and that Saccharina and Laminaria shared high phylogenetic affi nity. However, when it came to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level among the 41 SNPs, L. hyperborea owned 29 unique SNPs against 12 within the left three Saccharina species and 12 of the 13 indels were supposedly unique for L. hyperborea, indicated by its high variability. Originating from homologous ancestors, species between the recently diverged genera Laminaria and Saccharina may have taken in enough mutations at the SNP level only, in spite of different evolutionary strategies for better adaptation to the environment. Our study lays a solid foundation from a new perspective, although more accurate phylogenetic analysis is still needed to clarify the evolutionary traces between the genera Saccharina and Laminaria.

AB Powdery mildew (PM), caused by the fungus Erysiphe polygoni D.C, is one of the most common and serious diseases of cowpea (Vigna. unguiculata L. Walp.)/asparagus bean (Vigna. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis). Deployment of scab-resistant varieties is the major strategy to curb this disease. ZN016, a Chinese asparagus bean landrace, is highly resistant to powdery mildew. To identify the resistance genes in ZN016, an F-7:8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between ZN016 and a susceptible cultivar Zhijiang282 was evaluated for PM resistance in the open field in 2008 and 2009. Phenotypic analysis indicated that ZN016 harbors a single PM resistance gene. Using a SNP and SSR based genetic map constructed with this population, the PM resistance gene was mapped to a locus on LG9 flanked by SSR markers CLM0305 and CLM0260, with a genetic distance of 2.0 cM and 5.0 cM, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first powdery mildew resistance gene reported in cowpea, which was temporarily designated as Vu-Pml. The identification of Vu-Pml opens a door for dissecting resistance mechanisms and applying marker-assisted selection for the development of cultivars with PM resistance in cowpea.

AB Allele-specific markers for important genes can improve the efficiency of plant breeding. Their value can be enhanced if effects of the alleles for important traits can be estimated in identifiable types of environment. Provided potential bias can be minimised, large, unbalanced, datasets from previous plant-breeding and agronomic research can be used. Reliable, allele-specific markers are now available for the phenology genes Ppd-D1, Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1, the aluminium-tolerance gene TaALMT1, and the plant-stature genes Rht-B1 and Rht-D1. We used a set of 208 experiments with growing-season rainfall of <347 mm from southern Australia to estimate the effects of seven frequent combinations of the phenology genes, an intolerant and a tolerant allele of TaALMT1, and two semi-dwarf combinations Rht-B1b + Rht-D1a (Rht-ba) and Rht-B1a + Rht-D1b (Rht-ab) on grain yield in lower rainfall, Mediterranean-type environments in southern Australia. There were 775 lines in our analyses and a relationship matrix was used to minimise bias.
   Differences among the phenology genes were small, but the spring allele Vrn-B1a might be desirable. The tolerant allele, TaALMT1-V, was advantageous in locations with alkaline soils, possibly because of toxic levels of aluminium ions in subsoils. The advantage of TaALMT1-V is likely to be highest when mean maximum temperatures in spring are high. Rht-ab (Rht2 semi-dwarf) was also advantageous in environments with high mean maximum temperatures in spring, suggesting that for these stress environments, the combination of Vrn-B1a plus TaALMT1-V plus Rht-ab should be desirable. Many successful cultivars carry this combination.

AB In this study, a new disomic addition line, 12-5-2, with 44 chromosomes that was derived from BC3F2 descendants of the hybridization between Triticum aestivum cv. CN19 and Aegilops biuncialis was created and reported. 12-5-2 was immune to both powdery mildew and stripe rust and has stable fertility. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and C-banding revealed that 12-5-2 was a 1U(b) disomic addition line (ADL1U(b)). The seed storage protein electrophoresis showed that 12-5-2 presented all high molecular weight glutenin subunits (7 + 8 and 2 + 12) of CN19 and 2 new subunits that were designated Ux and Uy. Additionally, the flour quality parameters showed that the protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, wet gluten content, and grain hardness of 12-5-2 were significantly higher than those of its parent CN19. Moreover, 5 pairs of the chromosome 1U(b)-specific polymerase chain reaction-based landmark unique gene markers, TNAC1021, TNAC1041, TNAC1071, TNAC1-01, and TNAC1-04, were also obtained. The new ADL1U(b) 12-5-2 could be a valuable source for wheat improvement, especially for wheat end-product quality and resistance to disease.

AB We isolated a wheat germplasm line, 22-2, which was derived from common wheat (Triticum aestivum '7182') and Psathyrostachys huashanica 'Keng' (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs). Genomic composition and homoeologous relationships of 22-2 was analyzed using cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), EST-SSR, and EST-STS to characterize the alien chromatin in the transfer line. The cytological investigations showed that the chromosome number and configuration were 2n = 44 = 22 II. Mitotic and meiotic GISH using P. huashanica genomic DNA as the probe indicated that 22-2 contained a pair of P. huashanica chromosomes. The genomic affinities of the introduced P. huashanica chromosomes were determined by EST-SSR and EST-STS using multiple-loci markers from seven wheat homoeologous groups between the parents and addition line. One EST-SSR and 17 EST-STS markers, which were located on the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes of wheat, amplified polymorphic bands in 22-2 that were unique to P. huashanica. Thus, these markers suggested that the introduced Ns chromosome pair belonged to homoeologous group 3, so we designated 22-2 as a 3Ns disomic addition line. Based on disease reaction to mixed races (CYR31, CYR32, and Shuiyuan14) of stripe rust in the adult stages, 22-2 was found to have high resistance to stripe rust, which was possibly derived from its P. huashanica parent. Consequently, the new disomic addition line 22-2 could be a valuable donor source for wheat improvement depending on the excellent agronomic traits, especially, the introduction of novel disease resistance genes into wheat during breeding programs.

AB A total of 38 emmer wheat accessions, collected in several European countries, have been evaluated using agro-morphological traits, grain quality characteristics and molecular markers. The agronomic traits evaluated were: vernalisation response, winter hardiness, date of heading and flowering, lodging, plant height at harvest and resistances against powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis), leaf rust (Puccinia recondita) and yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis). Evaluation of quality traits has been performed measuring the protein content, gluten quality and quantity. In addition, a baking test has been executed. The assessment of genetic variability has been carried out at the molecular level utilizing 6 SSR, 6 EST-SSR markers for genes with known function, and 6 ISSR primers for a total of 107 loci analyzed. Mean 1,000 kernel weight ranged from 31.6 to 39.0 g for winter emmer accessions and from 22.9 to 42.6 for spring emmer accessions. The protein content for both winter and spring emmer was considerably affected by environment and genotype. Nearly, all the spring emmer accessions showed resistance to powdery mildew. Measurement of wet gluten content revealed high values, ranging from 37.0 to 56.6 %. The molecular analysis showed a great value of genetic distance between accessions; the expected heterozygosity and the variance between accessions indicate an equal distribution of the alleles (i.e. alleles frequency almost equal) and the presence of great variability in the analyzed material. Finally, no defined clusters were obtained considering winter versus spring accessions as well as the molecular markers did not discriminate the accessions respect their origin.

AB Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., is a common and widespread disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Egypt. Host resistance is the most economical, effective, and ecologically sustainable method of controlling the disease. Molecular markers help to determine leaf rust resistance genes (Lr genes). The objective of this study was to identify Lr genes in fifteen wheat cultivars from Egypt. Ten genes, Lr13, Lr19, Lr24, Lr26, Lr34, Lr35 Lr36, Lr37, Lr39, and Lr46, were detected in fifteen wheat cultivars using various molecular markers. The most frequently occurring genes in fifteen Egyptian wheat cultivars were Lr13, Lr24, Lr34, and Lr36 identified in all the cultivars used, followed by Lr26 and Lr35 (93%), Lr39 (66%), Lr37 (53%), and Lr46 (26.6%) of the cultivars, and finally Lr19 was present in 33.3% of cultivars. It is concluded that there was a good variation in Lr genes carried by wheat cultivars commercially grown in Egypt. Therefore, strategies for deploying resistance genes to prolong effective disease resistance are suggested to control wheat leaf rust disease.

AB Key message A major leaf shape locus (L) was mapped with molecular markers and genomically targeted to a small region in the D-genome of cotton. By using expression analysis and candidate gene mapping, two LMI1 -like genes are identified as possible candidates for leaf shape trait in cotton.
   Leaf shape in cotton is an important trait that influences yield, flowering rates, disease resistance, lint trash, and the efficacy of foliar chemical application. The leaves of okra leaf cotton display a significantly enhanced lobing pattern, as well as ectopic outgrowths along the lobe margins when compared with normal leaf cotton. These phenotypes are the hallmark characteristics of mutations in various known modifiers of leaf shape that culminate in the mis/over-expression of Class I KNOX genes. To better understand the molecular and genetic processes underlying leaf shape in cotton, a normal leaf accession (PI607650) was crossed to an okra leaf breeding line (NC05AZ21). An F-2 population of 236 individuals confirmed the incompletely dominant single gene nature of the okra leaf shape trait in Gossypium hirsutum L. Molecular mapping with simple sequence repeat markers localized the leaf shape gene to 5.4 cM interval in the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 15. Orthologous mapping of the closely linked markers with the sequenced diploid D-genome (Gossypium raimondii) tentatively resolved the leaf shape locus to a small genomic region. RT-PCR-based expression analysis and candidate gene mapping indicated that the okra leaf shape gene (L (o) ) in cotton might be an upstream regulator of Class I KNOX genes. The linked molecular markers and delineated genomic region in the sequenced diploid D-genome will assist in the future high-resolution mapping and map-based cloning of the leaf shape gene in cotton.

AB Key message Identified SSR markers ( Xcfd49 and Xbarc183 ) linked with stem rust resistance for efficient use in marker-assisted selection and stacking of resistance genes in wheat breeding programs.
   More than 80 % of the worldwide wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) area is currently sown with varieties susceptible to the Ug99 race group of stem rust fungus. However, wheat lines Niini, Tinkio, Coni, Pfunye, Blouk, and Ripper have demonstrated Ug99 resistance at the seedling and adult plant stages. We mapped stem rust resistance in populations derived from crosses of a susceptible parent with each of the resistant lines. The segregation of resistance in each population indicated the presence of a single gene. The resistance gene in Niini mapped to short arm of chromosome 6D and was flanked by SSR markers Xcfd49 at distances of 3.9 cM proximal and Xbarc183 8.4 cM distal, respectively. The chromosome location of this resistance was validated in three other populations: PBW343/Coni, PBW343/Tinkio, and Cacuke/Pfunye. Resistance initially postulated to be conferred by the SrTmp gene in Blouk and Ripper was also linked to Xcfd49 and Xbarc183 on 6DS, but it was mapped proximal to Xbarc183 at a similar position to previously mapped genes Sr42 and SrCad. Based on the variation in diagnostic marker alleles, it is possible that Niini and Pfunye may carry different resistance genes/alleles. Further studies are needed to determine the allelic relationships between various genes located on chromosome arm 6DS. Our results provide valuable molecular marker and genetic information for developing Ug99 resistant wheat varieties in diverse germplasm and using these markers to tag the resistance genes in wheat breeding.

AB Lolium isolate TP2 of Pyricularia oryzae, causal agent of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), is virulent on perennial ryegrass, but avirulent on wheat cultivars. Genetic analysis of wheat F-2 populations revealed that the resistance of wheat cultivars Chinese Spring, Shin-chunaga, and Norin 4 to TP2 was conditioned by two genes, R1 and R2. R1 was highly effective, while R2 was less effective. The strong resistance gene R1, designated Rmg6, was mapped on chromosome 1D using microsatellite markers. For revealing genetic mechanisms of avirulence, TP2 was crossed with Triticum isolate Br48. Segregation analysis of their F-1 progenies revealed that the avirulence of TP2 on the three wheat cultivars was conditioned by two unlinked genes, one (A1) highly effective and the other (A2) less effective. These results suggest that the incompatibility between TP2 and the common wheat cultivars is conditioned by two gene pairs; the Rmg6-A1 interaction results in strong resistance, and the R2-A2 interaction results in moderate resistance.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) reduces the quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the economic value of the grain. Our previous studies characterized the haplotypes of Viviparous-1B (Vp-1B) and its association with PHS resistance in Chinese wheats. The objective of this study was to analyze the haplotypes of Viviparous-1A (Vp-1A) and Viviparous-1D (Vp-1D) in a collection of 103 widely-grown winter wheats in China, and their associations with PHS resistance. In total, 17 Vp-1A haplotypes were explored on chromosome 3A of bread wheat, and were located in three major regions, the third intron, fifth intron and sixth exon, and designated TaVp-1Aam, TaVp-1Aan, TaVp-1Aao, TaVp-1Abm, TaVp-1Abn, TaVp-1Agm, TaVp-1Ahm, TaVp-1Ahn, TaVp-1Aho, TaVp-1Aim, TaVp-1Ain, TaVp-1Aio, TaVp-1Ajm, TaVp-1Ajn, TaVp-1Akm, TaVp-1Alm and TaVp-1Aln, respectively. However, no allelic variation of Vp-1D was found in this set of germplasm. Based on the haplotypes explored and their average germination index values, a novel co-dominant sequence-tagged site marker of the TaVp-1A gene was developed and designated Vp1A3. In most cases, haplotype TaVp-1Agm was associated with higher resistance to PHS. By combining with our previously exploited Vp1B3 marker, the efficiency of marker-assisted selection for PHS-resistant varieties was improved. Moreover, while the haplotype combination of TaVp-1Aam and TaVp-1Ba was associated with greater PHS susceptibility, the haplotype combinations TaVp-1Agm and TaVp-1Bb, TaVp-1Agm and TaVp-1Ba, TaVp-1Aim and TaVp-1Bb, and TaVp-1Aam and TaVp-1Bb could confer higher PHS resistance and be used as potential parental lines for molecular marker-assisted wheat breeding for PHS resistance.

AB Multiple trait integration (MTI) is a multi-step process of converting an elite variety/hybrid for value-added traits (e.g. transgenic events) through backcross breeding. From a breeding standpoint, MTI involves four steps: single event introgression, event pyramiding, trait fixation, and version testing. This study explores the feasibility of marker-aided backcross conversion of a target maize hybrid for 15 transgenic events in the light of the overall goal of MTI of recovering equivalent performance in the finished hybrid conversion along with reliable expression of the value-added traits. Using the results to optimize single event introgression (Peng et al. Optimized breeding strategies for multiple trait integration: I. Minimizing linkage drag in single event introgression. Mol Breed, 2013) which produced single event conversions of recurrent parents (RPs) with a parts per thousand currency sign8 cM of residual non-recurrent parent (NRP) germplasm with similar to 1 cM of NRP germplasm in the 20 cM regions flanking the event, this study focused on optimizing process efficiency in the second and third steps in MTI: event pyramiding and trait fixation. Using computer simulation and probability theory, we aimed to (1) fit an optimal breeding strategy for pyramiding of eight events into the female RP and seven in the male RP, and (2) identify optimal breeding strategies for trait fixation to create a 'finished' conversion of each RP homozygous for all events. In addition, next-generation seed needs were taken into account for a practical approach to process efficiency. Building on work by Ishii and Yonezawa (Optimization of the marker-based procedures for pyramiding genes from multiple donor lines: I. Schedule of crossing between the donor lines. Crop Sci 47:537-546, 2007a), a symmetric crossing schedule for event pyramiding was devised for stacking eight (seven) events in a given RP. Options for trait fixation breeding strategies considered selfing and doubled haploid approaches to achieve homozygosity as well as seed chipping and tissue sampling approaches to facilitate genotyping. With selfing approaches, two generations of selfing rather than one for trait fixation (i.e. 'F2 enrichment' as per Bonnett et al. in Strategies for efficient implementation of molecular markers in wheat breeding. Mol Breed 15:75-85, 2005) were utilized to eliminate bottlenecking due to extremely low frequencies of desired genotypes in the population. The efficiency indicators such as total number of plants grown across generations, total number of marker data points, total number of generations, number of seeds sampled by seed chipping, number of plants requiring tissue sampling, and number of pollinations (i.e. selfing and crossing) were considered in comparisons of breeding strategies. A breeding strategy involving seed chipping and a two-generation selfing approach (SC + SELF) was determined to be the most efficient breeding strategy in terms of time to market and resource requirements. Doubled haploidy may have limited utility in trait fixation for MTI under the defined breeding scenario. This outcome paves the way for optimizing the last step in the MTI process, version testing, which involves hybridization of female and male RP conversions to create versions of the converted hybrid for performance evaluation and possible commercial release.

AB The spike characteristics length, spikelet density and fertile floret number are related yield components and are important in cereal improvement. QSpl.nau-2D is a major quantitative trait locus controlling spike length (SPL) detected in the recombinant inbred line population developed by crossing wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars Nanda2419 with Wangshuibai. In this study, to validate its genetic effect and determine its precise location, QSpl.nau-2D's near-isogenic line (NIL) was developed using Mianyang99-323 as the recurrent parent through marker-assisted selection. Field trials showed that the NIL not only had significantly longer spikes on average than the recurrent parent but also had significantly higher grain weight, but did not differ in spikelet number and kernel number per spike. In the F2 population derived from a cross of the NIL with Mianyang99-323, QSpl.nau-2D functioned like a single gene and conditioned the SPL in a partially dominant manner, and was thus designated as HL1 (for head length). To precisely map HL1, 89 recombinants, consisting of 11 genotypes, were identified in the NIL-derived F2 population of 674 plants by using markers in the Xwmc25-Xgpw4080 interval. Phenotyping these lines showed that the introduction of a 0.9-cM interval flanked by Xcfd53 and DG371 in Nanda2419 resulted in longer spikes and a higher grain weight in the NIL. The availability of markers closely linked to HL1 could facilitate its use in breeding programs.

AB With the advent of next-generation Roche454 pyrosequencing technologies, transcriptome level sequence collections are arising as prominent resources for the discovery of gene-based molecular markers. In a previous study more than 1450 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences resulting from 454 pyrosequencing of Laodelphax striatellus cDNA were identified. From these we developed PCR primers for 40 di- or tri-candidate SSRs (minimum repeats>8) from the combined EST library. After extensive optimization, 13 pairs were end labeled with a fluorescent dye. Here, we also tested these 13 SSRs for cross-species amplification in two other planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera. The marker transferability was considerably high in N.lugens (92.31%) and in S.furcifera (61.54%). All of the 13 fluorescent SSRs were polymorphic, with allele numbers ranging from two to seven for 24 male and 24 female L.striatellus individuals. Observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.016 to 0.621. Development of SSR markers from ESTs will be a valuable tool to improve our understanding of population structure in this important rice pest.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an important cereal crop and a model species for Triticeae genomics. To lay the foundation for hierarchical map-based sequencing, a genome-wide physical map of its large and complex 5.1 billion-bp genome was constructed by high-information content fingerprinting of almost 600,000 bacterial artificial chromosomes representing 14-fold haploid genome coverage. The resultant physical map comprises 9,265 contigs with a cumulative size of 4.9 Gb representing 96% of the physical length of the barley genome. The reliability of the map was verified through extensive genetic marker information and the analysis of topological networks of clone overlaps. A minimum tiling path of 66,772 minimally overlapping clones was defined that will serve as a template for hierarchical clone-by-clone map-based shotgun sequencing. We integrated whole-genome shotgun sequence data from the individuals of two mapping populations with published bacterial artificial chromosome survey sequence information to genetically anchor the physical map. This novel approach in combination with the comprehensive whole-genome shotgun sequence data sets allowed us to independently validate and improve a previously reported physical and genetic framework. The resources developed in this study will underpin fine-mapping and cloning of agronomically important genes and the assembly of a draft genome sequence.

AB Exploiting and utilizing excellent gene(s) from wild species has become an essential strategy for wheat improvement. In the disomic addition line 24-6-3, the 4Ns chromosomes from Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs) carried valuable tiller and strip rust resistance gene(s), which was selected from the progeny of common wheat cv. 7182 and P. huashanica via embryo culture. Cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and EST-STS analyses were used to detect the 4Ns chromosome in wheat background and its homoeologous relationship. Cytological studies demonstrated that 24-6-3 contained 44 chromosomes and formed 22 bivalents during meiotic metaphase I. GISH using P. huashanica genomic DNA as a probe indicated that a pair of Ns-chromosomes with strong hybridization signals had been introduced into 24-6-3. Ten EST-STS markers, i.e., BE404973, BE442811, BE446061, BE446076, BE497324, BE591356, BF473854, BG274986, BQ161513 and CD373484, which were located on the homoeologous group 4 chromosomes of wheat, amplified bands unique to P. huashanica in 24-6-3. This indicated the presence of an introgressed P. huashanica Ns chromosome pair belonging to homoeologous group 4, which we designated the 4Ns disomic addition line. After it was inoculated using mixed races of stripe rust in the adult stages, 24-6-3 expressed high stripe rust resistance, which was possibly derived from its P. huashanica parent. Moreover, its increased number of tillers was probably controlled by gene(s) located in P. huashanica chromosome 4Ns. These high levels of disease resistance and excellent agronomic traits make the 24-6-3 line a promising germplasm for breeding in wheat.

AB Leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) is one of the most important diseases of wheat in Uruguay, and breeding for resistance to this disease is a priority for the INIA wheat program. Knowledge of the effective resistance genes present in the germplasm is relevant when selecting for effective and more durable resistance. The leaf rust resistance present in six adapted wheat cultivars that are parents of many advanced lines was studied. Races of P. triticina with different virulence combinations were used to determine which seedling resistance genes might be present in the six cultivars and/or derived lines. Genetic analysis of seedling and adult plant resistance (APR) was conducted on BC(1)F2 and F-3 generations from crosses of four cultivars with the susceptible cultivar Thatcher. The presence of APR genes Lr13 and Lr34 was confirmed with crosses of the four cultivars and Thatcher lines with these genes. A genetic marker associated with Lr34 was used to postulate the presence of this gene in all cultivars. The cultivars and resistance genes postulated to be present were: Estanzuela Calandria Lr3bg, Lr16 and Lr24; Estanzuela Federal Lr10; Estanzuela Halcon Lr10, Lr14a, and Lr16; INIA Tijereta and INIA Garza Lr16, Lr24 and Lr34; and INIA Torcaza Lr10 and Lr24. Only Lr16 and Lr34 remain effective to the predominant pathotypes. Additional ineffective seedling resistance that could not be identified was present in E. Federal, I. Tijereta and I. Torcaza. Unknown APR gene(s) could be present in E. Calandria and E. Federal.

AB Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat greatly reduces the quality and economic value of grain, and PHS resistance is one of the most important traits in wheat breeding. Red-grained wheat varieties are generally more resistant to PHS than white-grained ones; however, some are still susceptible. The red pigment of red-grained wheat is synthesized through the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, in which the dihydroflavonol-4-reductase gene (DFR) is one of the genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis. In this study, a set of 120 red-grained Chinese wheat cultivars and lines with distinct PHS resistance were used to characterize TaDFR genotype variations and their association with PHS resistance. Whereas no variation or functional variation of TaDFR genes was detected on chromosomes 3A and 3D, a novel TaDFR allele, designated TaDFR-Bb, was explored on chromosome 3B. Compared with TaDFR-Ba, an 8 bp insertion (CTCTAGGA) was identified in the promoter region of TaDFR-B in most of the PHS resistant red-grained wheat varieties and advanced lines. Based on this, a CAPS marker was designed and validated with a set of Chinese red-grained wheat cultivars and lines with distinct PHS resistance. In most cases, TaDFR-Bb was associated with higher PHS resistance. An association study indicated that wheat varieties with the 8 bp insertion (average seed germination index 23.6 %) were significantly more resistant (P < 0.01) to PHS than those without the insertion (average seed germination index 69.5 %). Further study on gene expression demonstrated that the insertion led to increased TaDFR-B expression in cultivars with PHS resistance. Transient expression of TaDFR-B in coleoptiles of wheat cv. Chinese Spring revealed that increasing TaDFR gene expression did not induce the synthesis of anthocyanins.

AB Background: The Rlnn1 locus, which resides on chromosome 7A of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) confers moderate resistance against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus. Prior to this research, the exact linkage relationships of Rlnn1 with other loci on chromosome 7A were not clear and there were no simple codominant markers available for selection of Rlnn1 in wheat breeding. The objectives of the research reported here were to (1) develop an improved genetic map of the Rlnn1 region of chromosome 7A and (2) develop molecular markers that could be used in marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of wheat against P. neglectus.
   Results: A large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance against P. neglectus was genetically mapped using a population of Excalibur/Kukri doubled haploid lines. This QTL coincides in position with the rust resistance gene(s) Lr20/Sr15, the phytoene synthase gene Psy-A1 and 10 molecular markers, including five new markers designed using wheat-rice comparative genomics and wheat expressed sequence tags. Two of the new markers are suitable for use as molecular diagnostic tools to distinguish plants that carry Rlnn1 and Lr20/Sr15 from those that do not carry these resistance genes.
   Conclusions: The genomic location of Rlnn1 was confirmed to be in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7A. Molecular markers were developed that provide simple alternatives to costly phenotypic assessment of resistance against P. neglectus in wheat breeding. In Excalibur, genetic recombination seems to be completely suppressed in the Rlnn1 region.

AB The wax (glaucousness) on wheat leaves and stems is mainly controlled by two sets of genes: glaucousness loci (W1 and W2) and non-glaucousness loci (Iw1 and Iw2). The non-glaucousness (Iw) loci act as inhibitors of the glaucousness loci (W). High-resolution comparative genetic linkage maps of the wax inhibitors Iw1 originating from Triticum dicoccoides, and Iw2 from Aegilops tauschii were developed by comparative genomics analyses of Brachypodium, sorghum and rice genomic sequences corresponding to the syntenic regions of the Iw loci in wheat. Eleven Iw1 and eight Iw2 linked EST markers were developed and mapped to linkage maps on the distal regions of chromosomes 2BS and 2DS, respectively. The Iw1 locus mapped within a 0.96 cM interval flanked by the BE498358 and CA499581 EST markers that are collinear with 122 kb, 202 kb, and 466 kb genomic regions in the Brachypodium 5S chromosome, the sorghum 6S chromosome and the rice 4S chromosome, respectively. The Iw2 locus was located in a 4.1 to 5.4-cM interval in chromosome 2DS that is flanked by the CJ886319 and CJ519831 EST markers, and this region is collinear with a 2.3 cM region spanning the Iw1 locus on chromosome 2BS. Both Iw1 and Iw2 co-segregated with the BF474014 and CJ876545 EST markers, indicating they are most likely orthologs on 2BS and 2DS. These high-resolution maps can serve as a framework for chromosome landing, physical mapping and map-based cloning of the wax inhibitors in wheat.

AB The crucifer Orychophragmus violaceus (2n = 24) with large purple flowers is cultivated as an ornamental plant in China. Previously intergeneric or even intertribal somatic hybrids between Brassica napus (2n = 38, AACC) and O. violaceus were produced and backcrossing progenies developed. In this study, eight out of potential twelve mono-/disomic alien addition lines (MAALs/DAALs) carrying one or two copies of individual O. violaceus chromosomes were further established. One disomic substitution line was selected by crossing the addition line with one B. napus nullisomics. These lines were distinguishable from each other by their phenotypes and chromosome markers, for some expressed the traits specific for O. violaceus (serrated leaves, basal clustering stems, purple flowers, respectively), and the others showed the new traits for two parents (female sterility, early flowering). The rDNA loci on three O. violaceus chromosomes were active and gave differential amounts of rRNA transcripts in the B. napus background, showing the variable degrees of nucleolar dominance. The O. violaceus chromosomes added to or substituted into the B. napus background were stably maintained in somatic and meiotic cells, and could be transmitted to the progeny through male and female gametes. These MAALs/DAALs were useful for elucidating the genome structure of O. violaceus, molecular mechanism behind the epigenetic phenomenon of nucleolar dominance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. The motivation and function of the development of brown fat may thus counteract obesity, though this remains uncertain. We investigated the brown adipocyte proteome by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. Comparative analyses of proteins focused on total protein spots to filter differentially expressed proteins during the differentiation of mouse primary brown preadipocytes. A Western blot analysis was performed to verify the target proteins. The results indicated that 10 protein spots were differentially expressed with significant changes, including the three up-regulated proteins of prohibitin, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and enoyl-CoA hydratase protein; the 5 down-regulated proteins of triosephosphate isomerase, elongation factor 2, alpha-tropomyosin slow, endophilin-B1, and cofilin-1 (CFL1); and the two unequivocally expressed proteins of peroxiredoxin-1 and collagen alpha-1(i) chain precursor. We found that during brown adipogenesis, CFL1 has an inhibitory effect on brown adipocyte differentiation. The overexpression of CFL1 inhibited the brown fat deposition and repressed the brown marker genes UCP1, PRDM16, PGC-1 alpha and PPAR gamma via actin dynamics and polymerization. These observations may be novel findings that bring new insight into the detailed mechanisms of brown adipogenesis and identify possible therapeutic targets for anti-obesity.
   Biological significance
   We use 2-DE to compare the proteomes of adipocytes during the brown adipogenesis of primary mouse preadipocytes. We identified 10 proteins that are differentially expressed. Among these, we found that the actin binding protein CFL1 inhibits the differentiation of brown preadipocytes.

AB Background: Flowering time greatly influences the adaptation of wheat cultivars to diverse environmental conditions and is mainly controlled by vernalization and photoperiod genes. In wheat cultivars from the Yellow and Huai Valleys, which represent 60%-70% of the total wheat production in China, the large-scale genotyping of wheat germplasms has not yet been performed in terms of vernalization and photoperiod response alleles, limiting the use of Chinese wheat germplasms to a certain extent.
   Results: In this study, 173 winter wheat cultivars and 51 spring wheat cultivars from China were used to identify allelic variations of vernalization and photoperiod genes as well as copy number variations of Ppd-B1 and Vrn-A1. Two new co-dominant markers were developed in order to more precisely examine Vrn-A1b, Vrn-B1a, and Vrn-B1b. Two novel alleles at the Vrn-B3 locus were discovered and were designated Vrn-B3b and Vrn-B3c. Vrn-B3b had an 890-bp insertion in the promoter region of the recessive vrn-B3 allele, and Vrn-B3c allele had 2 deletions (a 20-bp deletion and a 4-bp deletion) in the promoter region of the dominant Vrn-B3a allele. Cultivar Hemai 26 lacked the Vrn-A1 gene. RT-PCR indicated that the 890-bp insertion in the Vrn-B3b allele significantly reduced the transcription of the Vrn-B3 gene. Cultivars Chadianhong with the Vrn-B3b allele and Hemai 26 with a Vrn-A1-null allele possessed relatively later heading and flowering times compared to those of Yanzhan 4110, which harbored recessive vrn-B3 and vrn-A1 alleles. Through identification of photoperiod genes, 2 new polymorphism combinations were found in 6 winter wheat cultivars and were designated Hapl-VII and Hapl-VIII, respectively. Distribution of the vernalization and photoperiod genes indicated that all recessive alleles at the 4 vernalization response loci, truncated "Chinese Spring" Ppd-B1 allele at Ppd-B1 locus and Hapl-I at the Ppd-D1 locus were predominant in Chinese winter wheat cultivars.
   Conclusion: This study illustrated the distribution of vernalization and photoperiod genes and identified 2 new Vrn-B3 alleles, 1 Vrn-A1-null allele, and two new Ppd-D1 polymorphism combinations, using developed functional markers. Results of this study have the potential to provide useful information for screening relatively superior wheat cultivars for better adaptability and maturity.

AB Background: Septoria tritici blotch is an important leaf disease of European winter wheat. In our survey, we analyzed Septoria tritici blotch resistance in field trials with a large population of 1,055 elite hybrids and their 87 parental lines. Entries were fingerprinted with the 9 k SNP array. The accuracy of prediction of Septoria tritici blotch resistance achieved with different genome-wide mapping approaches was evaluated based on robust cross validation scenarios.
   Results: Septoria tritici blotch disease severities were normally distributed, with genotypic variation being significantly (P < 0.01) larger than zero. The cross validation study revealed an absence of large effect QTL for additive and dominance effects. Application of genomic selection approaches particularly designed to tackle complex agronomic traits allowed to double the accuracy of prediction of Septoria tritici blotch resistance compared to calculation methods suited to detect QTL with large effects.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that Septoria tritici blotch resistance in European winter wheat is controlled by multiple loci with small effect size. This suggests that the currently achieved level of resistance in this collection is likely to be durable, as involvement of a high number of genes in a resistance trait reduces the risk of the resistance to be overcome by specific pathogen isolates or races.

AB Background: The cultivated tomato is second most consumed vegetable of the world and is an important part of a diverse and balanced diet as a rich source of vitamins, minerals, phenolic antioxidants and antioxidant lycopene having anti-cancer properties. To reap benefit of genomics of the domestic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) unravelled by Tomato Genome Consortium (The Tomato Genome Consortium, 2012), the bulk mining of its markers in totality is imperative and critically required. The solgenomics has limited number of microsatellite DNA markers (2867) pertaining to solanaceae family. As these markers are of linkage map having relative distance, the choice of selected markers based on absolute distance as of physical map is missing. Only limited microsatellite markers with limitations are reported for variety identification thus there is a need for more markers supplementing DUS test and also for traceability of product in global market.
   Description: We present here the first whole genome based microsatellite DNA marker database of tomato, TomSatDB (Tomato MicroSatellite Database) with more than 1.4 million markers mined in-silico, using MIcroSAtellite (MISA) tool. To cater the customized needs of wet lab, features with a novelty of an automated primer designing tool is added. TomSatDB (http://cabindb.iasri.res.in/tomsatdb), a user-friendly and freely accessible tool offers chromosome wise as well as location wise search of primers. It is an online relational database based on "three-tier architecture" that catalogues information of microsatellites in MySQL and user-friendly interface developed using PHP (Hypertext Pre Processor).
   Conclusion: Besides abiotic stress, tomato is known to have biotic stress due to its susceptibility over 200 diseases caused by pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes. These markers are expected to pave the way of germplasm management over abiotic and biotic stress as well as improvement through molecular breeding, leading to increased tomato productivity in India as well as other parts of the world. In era of IPR the new variety can be identified based on allelic variation among varieties supplementing DUS test and product traceability.

AB Many plant species of great economic value (e.g., potato, wheat, cotton, and sugarcane) are polyploids. Despite the essential roles of autopolyploid plants in human activities, our genetic understanding of these species is still poor. Recent progress in instrumentation and biochemical manipulation has led to the accumulation of an incredible amount of genomic data. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time a successful genetic analysis in a highly polyploid genome (sugarcane) by the quantitative analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allelic dosage and the application of a new data analysis framework. This study provides a better understanding of autopolyploid genomic structure and is a sound basis for genetic studies. The proposed methods can be employed to analyse the genome of any autopolyploid and will permit the future development of high-quality genetic maps to assist in the assembly of reference genome sequences for polyploid species.

AB Chromosome mutations occur in common wheat carrying a monosome of gametocidal (Gc) chromosomes 2C and 3C(SAT). These Gc chromosomes have been known to induce chromosomal breakage in a rye chromosome 1R added to common wheat. We attempted to introduce the two Gc chromosomes into the other six rye chromosome (2R to 7R) addition or substitution lines of common wheat to establish a set of chromosomal rearrangement-inducing lines for rye chromosomes. We obtained critical plants that had a pair of rye chromosomes and one Gc chromosome for 2R, 3R, 4R and 6R, and semi-critical plants that were monotelodisomic and monosomic for 5R. Chromosomal aberrations are expected to occur in the progeny of these plants. Besides we established self-fertile disomic 2C addition lines of common wheat that were disomic substitution for 3R, disomic addition for 6R, monotelodisomic for 5R, and monosomic for 7R. We can produce the critical plants of the respective rye chromosomes by crossing above lines to the respective wheat-rye disomic addition or substitution lines. During the cytological screening in this study, we found Gc-induced chromosomal aberrations for every rye chromosome. The stocks reported here can be used to produce dissection lines for each of the rye chromosomes in common wheat by the Gc system.

AB We evaluated the genome structure and salt stress response of BC1F6 lines derived from a cross between an Iranian salt tolerant bread wheat cultivar 'Roushan' (2n=6x=42, AABBDD) and a synthetic allohexaploid Tritipyrum (2n=6x=42, AABBE(b)E(b)). Sixteen lines (L1 to L16) and their parents were studied for their chromosome composition, K+:Na+ ratio, and relative dry mass (RDM) by growing them in nutrient solution containing 0 (control) or 100 mM NaCl (treatment). Among the studied lines, eight wheat-Thinopyrum bessarabicum (E-b genome) disomic substitution lines were identified using PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers and cytogenetic analysis. Ten (37%) of 27 PLUG markers used were informative for E-b chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in a wheat background. PLUG markers also revealed that one line, L9, was a disomic substitution line DS2E(b)(2B), and that seven lines, L3, L4, L7, L8, L14, L15, and L16, were DS6E(b)(6D). There were large differences in morphological traits and salinity tolerance even among DS6E(b)(6D) substitutions or untranslocated lines, due perhaps to unidentified rearrangements or small introgressions.

AB Wheat is one of the most important staple food crop in the world is adversely affected by drought. Understanding its genetics and genome organization using molecular markers is of great value for plant breeding purposes. Drought tolerance is a difficult trait to define as it encompasses a wide range of characteristics involving multiple genetic, physiological, cellular and biochemical strategies in the plants. The transcription factor, DREB2A is one of the promising candidate genes involved in the dehydration tolerance in crop plants. Dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) protein is a subfamily of AP2/ERF transcription which control expression of many drought, salinity and cold inducible genes and causing tolerance to environmental stresses in many plants. The main property of DREB gene is conserved AP2 domain that binds to stress responsive elements. Some selected wheat genotypes were taken for isolation and sequence analysis of DREB2A. NL 897/NL 714//BL 2218 and BAW 969/SHATABDI wheat genotypes along with C 306, drought tolerant variety revealed the presence of AP2 domain when multiple sequence alignment was performed across genotypes.

AB Sitobion avenae (F.) is a cosmopolitan cereal pest, but geographic barriers like the Qinling Mountains in the Shaanxi Province of China may lead to isolation among its populations, thus causing allopatric speciation. We sampled S. avenae populations from areas north (mean annual temperature, approximate to 9 degrees C) and south (mean annual temperature, approximate to 14 degrees C) of the Qinling Mountains, and tested them at 20 degrees C in common garden experiments. The results showed that northern populations had reduced developmental time for first-instar nymphs but prolonged for third-and fourth-instar nymphs compared with southern populations. The postreproductive time and total lifespan of adults from southern populations were longer than those from northern populations, but no significant differences were found in reproductive time or age at first reproduction. Southern populations showed higher lifetime and daily fecundities than northern ones. Significant differences were found in correlation of life-history traits between northern and southern populations. Principal component analyses (PCAs) of S. avenae's vital life-history traits showed separation of populations from three southern locations, indicating their local adaptation. The clustering patterns generated by PCA also showed divergence between northern and southern populations. Alatae of S. avenae seemed to be able to disperse across the Qinling Mountains, which was indicated by the clustering together of some individuals from one side of the mountains with those from the other side. The impacts of the Qinling Mountains on the divergence and gene flow among S. avenae populations, as well as the potential of allopatric speciation for this species, are discussed.

AB Selection for quality traits in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during early breeding generations requires quick analytical methods that need small grain samples. Marker assisted selection can be useful for the improvement of quality traits in wheat. The present study was conducted to screen 117 Pakistani adapted spring wheat varieties with DNA markers linked with genes controlling composition of low and high molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS and HMW-GS, respectively), starch viscosity, Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and grain hardness. DNA fragments associated with the presence/absence of quality related genes were amplified using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detected using agarose gel electrophoresis. Positive allele of.-secalin, which indicates presence of 1B.1R translocation, was found in 77 (66%) varieties. The marker PPO05 was found in 30 (26%) varieties, indicating lower PPO activity. Grain hardness controlled by Pinb-D1b allele was present in 49 (42%) varieties. Allele Wx-B1b which confers superior noodle quality was found in 48 (41%) varieties. HMW-GS encoded by Glu-D1d allele that exerts a positive effect on dough strength was present in 115 (98%) varieties. LMW-GS alleles Glu-A3d and Glu-B3 were observed in 21 (18%) and 76 (65%) varieties, respectively. Results of the present study may help wheat breeders in selecting parents for improving desirable quality attributes of future wheat varieties. The varieties, identified having desirable quality genes, in this study can be used in the wheat breeding programs aiming to improve quality traits. Early generation marker assisted selection can help to efficiently utilize resources of a breeding program.

AB Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme in the formation of the amino acid glutamine during N assimilation. The characterization of GS genes and the development of functional markers are important for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programs. In the present study, the full-length genomic DNA (gDNA) sequence of TaGS1a was obtained from 60 wheat varieties. TaGS1a comprises 3415 bp and has eleven exons and ten introns. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two insertions and deletions of DNA segments (InDels) were detected in introns, resulting two haplotypes: Hap 1 and Hap 2. A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was developed to distinguish the two haplotypes. The TaGS1a-CAPS marker was located on chromosome 6D using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines, and mapped at 2.5 cM from the SSR marker barc1121b in a RIL population. The completely corresponding results between quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and association analysis suggested that the TaGS1a gene had functions for grain size traits, including thousand grain weight (TGW), grain width (GW), grain height (GH), GL/GW ratio (GLW), factor form density (FFD), grain area (GA) and grain volume (GV) during maturity stage, and for the ratio of root/shoot for dry weight and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium contents (RSDW, RSNC, RSPC and RSKC) during seedling stage.

AB Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng is an endangered species that is endemic to China, which provides an important gene pool for wheat improvement. We developed a quick and reliable PCR-based diagnostic assay to accurately and efficiently detect P. huashanica DNA sequences from introgression lines, which was based on a species-specific marker derived from genomic DNA. The 900-bp PCR-amplified band used as a P. huashanica-specific RAPD marker was tested with 21 different plant species and was converted into a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker by cloning and sequencing the selected fragments (pHs11). This SCAR marker, which was designated as RHS-23, could clearly distinguish the presence of P. huashanica DNA repetitive sequences in wheat-P. huashanica derivative lines. The specificity of the marker was validated using 21 different plant species and a complete set of wheat-P. huashanica disomic addition lines (1Ns - 7Ns, 2n = 44 = 22II). This specific sequence targeted the Ns genome of P. huashanica and it was present in all the seven P. huashanica chromosomes. Therefore, this SCAR marker is specific for P. huashanica chromosomes and may be used in the identification of alien repetitive sequences in large gene pools. This diagnostic PCR assay for screening the target genetic material may play a key role in marker-assisted selective breeding programs .

AB Five mitochondrial (mt) protein-encoding genes (COX1, COX2, CytB, ND4 and ND5) from the wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), were sequenced and compared with those of 3 other Cecidomyiidae species, Mayetiola destructor, Rhopalomyia pomum, and Asphondylia rosetta. These genes shared similar AT content (74.0-80.1%) and base substitution bias in favour of transversions (68.87-79.72%) over transitions (20.28-37.04%). Substitution saturation analyses indicated fast saturation of transitional substitutions in COX2, CytB, ND4 and ND5, especially at the 3rd codon positions. Analysis of interspecific divergence among the 4 species showed that the sequence divergence rates (evolutionary rates) were in the order of ND4 = CytB > COX2 = ND5 > COX1. Intraspecific genetic polymorphism analysis within the field populations of S. mosellana indicated that ND4 had the highest genetic polymorphism and COX1 the lowest. Genetic variation patterns suggested that COX1 could be used as a molecular marker for phylogenetic analysis across a relatively wide taxonomic range in Cecidomyiidae, while COX2 and ND5 may be useful for estimating relationships at a subgenus level or among closely related species. With its high genetic polymorphism, ND4 is the molecular marker most suitable for population genetics studies. These findings will be valuable for our further understanding and studies in evolutionary biology and population genetics for S. mosellana and other Cecidomyiidae insects.

AB The genetic map of chromosome 5B has been constructed by using microsatellite (SSR) analysis of 381 plants from the F2 population produced by cross of the Chinese Spring (CS) and Renan cultivars. Initially, 180 SSR markers for the common wheat 5B chromosome have been used for analysis of these cultivars. The 32 markers able to detect polymorphism between these cultivars have been located on the genetic map of chromosome 5B. Cytogenetic mapping has involved a set of CS 5B chromosome deletion lines. Totally, 51 SSR markers have been located in ten regions (deletion bins) of this chromosome by SSR analysis of these deletion lines. Five genes-TaCBFIIIc-B10, Vrn-B1, Chi-B1, Skr, and Ph1-have been integrated into the cytogenetic map of chromosome 5B using the markers either specific of or tightly linked to the genes in question. Comparison of the genetic and cytogenetic maps suggests that recombination is suppressed in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 5B, especially in the short arm segment. The 18 markers localized to deletion bins 5BL16-0.79-1.00 and 5BL18-0.66-0.79 have been used to analyze common wheat introgression lines L842, L5366-180, L73/00i, and L21-4, carrying fragments of alien genomes in the terminal region of 5B long arm. L5366-180 and L842 lines carry a fragment of the Triticum timopheevii 5GL chromosome, while L73/00i and L21-4 lines, a fragment of the Aegilops speltoides 5SL chromosome. As has been shown, the translocated fragments in these four lines are of different lengths, allowing bin 5BL18-0.66-0.79 to be divided into three shorter regions. The utility of wheat introgression lines carrying alien translocations for increasing the resolution of cytogenetic mapping is discussed.

AB Based on the similarity in gene structure between rice and wheat, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) system enabled us to design primer sets that amplify wheat genic sequences including introns. From the previously reported wheat PLUG markers, we chose 144 markers that are distributed on different chromosomes and in known chromosomal regions (bins) to obtain rye-specific PCR-based markers. We conducted PCR with the 144 primer sets and the template of the Imperial rye genomic DNA and found that 131 (91.0 %) primer sets successfully amplified PCR products. Of the 131 PLUG markers, 110 (76.4 %) markers showed rye-specific PCR amplification with or without restriction enzyme digestion. We assigned 79 of the 110 markers to seven rye chromosomes (1R to 7R) using seven wheat-rye (cv. Imperial) chromosome addition and substitution lines: 12 to 1R, 8 to 2R, 11 to 3R, 8 to 4R, 16 to 5R, 12 to 6R, and 12 to 7R. Furthermore, we located their positions on the short or long (L) chromosome arm, using 13 Imperial rye telosomic lines of common wheat (except for 3RL). Referring to the chromosome bin locations of the 79 PLUG markers in wheat, we deduced the syntenic relationships between rye and wheat chromosomes. We also discussed chromosomal rearrangements in the rye genome with reference to the cytologically visible chromosomal gaps.

AB A study on mode of inheritance and mapping of fertility restorer (Rf) gene(s) using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was conducted in a cross of male sterile line 2041A having Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm and a restorer line PWR4099 of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The F-1 hybrid was completely fertile indicating that fertility restoration is a dominant trait. Based on the pollen fertility and seed set of bagged spikes in F-2 generation, the individual plants were classified into fertile and sterile groups. Out of 120 F-2 plants, 97 were fertile and 23 sterile (based on pollen fertility) while 98 plants set a parts per thousand yen5 seeds/spike and 22 produced a parts per thousand currency sign4 or no seed. The observed frequency fits well into Mendelian ratio of 3 fertile: 1 sterile with chi(2) value of 2.84 for pollen fertility and 2.17 for seed setting indicating that the fertility restoration is governed by a single dominant gene in PWR4099. The three linked SSR markers, Xwmc503, Xgwm296 and Xwmc112 located on the chromosome 2DS were placed at a distance of 3.3, 5.8 and 6.7 cM, respectively, from the Rf gene. Since, no known Rf gene is located on the chromosome arm 2DS, the Rf gene in PWR4099 is a new gene and proposed as Rf8. The closest SSR marker, Xwmc503, linked to the Rf8 was validated in a set of Rf, maintainer and cytoplasmic male sterile lines. The closely linked SSR marker Xwmc503 may be used in marker-assisted backcross breeding facilitating the transfer of fertility restoration gene Rf8 into elite backgrounds with ease.

AB Segregation distortion of molecular markers is closely related to hybrid incompatibility in progeny from intraspecific crosses. Recent reports in higher plants have demonstrated that hybrid sterility results in segregation distortion at the causal gene regions in progeny of intraspecific crosses. Ne1 and Ne2 complementary loci are known to control hybrid necrosis in intraspecific crosses of common wheat cultivars. Here, we examine the effect of a weak necrosis allele Ne1 (w) on the segregation ratio of molecular markers in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of common wheat. Some RILs showed accelerated cell death in the leaves at the heading stage due to the epistatic interaction between two quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 5B and 2B. Chromosomal localization of these QTL corresponding to Ne1 (w) and Ne2 showed distorted segregation ratios of assigned markers having oppositely biased direction. Although the Ne1 (w) and Ne2 interaction had no obvious effect on seed fertility, Ne1 (w) reduced completion of grain development under the Ne2-homozygous background. This reduction might be one of causes that induces segregation distortion in the 5B and 2B chromosomal regions of RILs. The present study demonstrated that weak hybrid necrosis has limited phenotypic effects; it causes segregation distortion in progeny from intraspecific crosses.

AB For almost 2 centuries it has been disputed whether Tuber aestivum and Tuber uncinatum constitute two different species of truffles. Molecular markers have been applied previously to contribute to resolving this question, coming to different conclusions. In this study, we address this question by analyzing the genetic structure of truffles assigned to either of the two putative species from a geographically broad sampling across Europe. We used an approach involving multigene phylogenies and coalescent analyses of nine regions from five genes. All tests conducted supported the conspecificity of Tuber aestivum and Tuber uncinatum.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an important component of heart-healthy whole grain diets because it contains -glucan. All current US barley varieties with high -glucan are spring habit and have waxy starch. Winter varieties have agronomic advantages but require low-temperature tolerance (LTT). Vernalization sensitivity (VS) is associated with higher levels of LTT. To rapidly develop fall-sown varieties with LTT and higher grain -glucan, we therefore used marker-assisted selection (MAS) at the WX and VRN-H2 loci. The MAS-derived lines, together with unrelated non-waxy germplasm developed via phenotypic selection (PS), were used for a genome-wide association scan (GWAS). The panel was phenotyped for grain -glucan, LTT and VS. It was genotyped with 3072 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and allele-specific primers. Marker-assisted selection fixed target alleles at both loci but only one of the target phenotypes (higher -glucan percentage) was achieved. Variation for VS and LTT is attributable to (i) incomplete information about VRN-H1 at the outset of the project and (ii) unexpected allelic variation at VRN-H3 with a large effect on VS and LTT.

AB Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is an important cool-season legume that can be severely damaged by rust (Uromyces viciae-fabae (Pers.) Schrot.) in many parts of the world. In this work, a collection of L.culinaris germplasm accessions was screened under growth chamber conditions for response to U.viciae-fabae. Several sources of incomplete resistance have been identified, both of hypersensitive and of non-hypersensitive nature. Incomplete hypersensitive resistance was due to a late-acting host cell necrosis that resulted in an intermediate infection type (IT). Incomplete non-hypersensitive resistance was due to a hampered cell penetration not associated with host cell necrosis, reducing the number of haustoria per colony and therefore hindering the growth of the colony and reducing and retarding disease development in spite of a high IT.

AB The wheat spindle streak mosaic virus (WSSMV) or wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) resistance gene, Wss1, from Haynaldia villosa, was previously mapped to the chromosome arm 4VS by the development of 4V (4D) substitution and T4DL center dot 4VS translocation lines. For better utilization and more accurate mapping of the Wss1, in this research, the CS ph1b mutant was used to induce new translocations with shortened 4VS chromosome fragments. Thirty-five homozygous translocations with different alien fragment sizes and breakpoints of 4VS were identified by GISH and molecular marker analysis. By field test, it was found that all the identified terminal translocations characterized as having smaller 4VS chromosome segments in the chromosome 4DS were highly resistant to WYMV, while all the interstitial translocations with 4VS inserted into the 4DS were WYMV susceptible. Marker analysis using 32 4VS-specific markers showed that both the terminal and interstitial translocations had different alien fragment sizes. Five specific markers could be detected in the WYMV-resistant terminal translocation line NAU421 with the shortest introduced 4VS fragment, indicating they can be used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. Based on the resistance evaluation, GISH and molecular marker analysis of the available translocations, the gene(s) conferring the WYMV resistance on 4VS could be further cytologically mapped to the distal region of 4VS, immersed in the bin of FL 0.78-1.00. The newly developed small fragment translocations with WYMV resistance and 4VS specific markers have laid solid groundwork for the utilization in wheat breeding for WYMV resistance as well as further cloning of Wss1.

AB Wheat- Aegilops speltoides recombinants carrying stem rust resistance genes Sr32 and SrAes1t effective against Ug99 and PCR markers for marker-assisted selection.
   Wild relatives of wheat are important resources for new rust resistance genes but underutilized because the valuable resistances are often linked to negative traits that prevent deployment of these genes in commercial wheats. Here, we report ph1b-induced recombinants with reduced alien chromatin derived from E.R. Sears' wheat-Aegilops speltoides 2D-2S#1 translocation line C82.2, which carries the widely effective stem rust resistance gene Sr32. Infection type assessments of the recombinants showed that the original translocation in fact carries two stem rust resistance genes, Sr32 on the short arm and a previously undescribed gene SrAes1t on the long arm of chromosome 2S#1. Recombinants with substantially shortened alien chromatin were produced for both genes, which confer resistance to stem rust races in the TTKSK (Ug99) lineage and representative races of all Australian stem rust lineages. Selected recombinants were back crossed into adapted Australian cultivars and PCR markers were developed to facilitate the incorporation of these genes into future wheat varieties. Our recombinants and those from several other labs now show that Sr32, Sr39, and SrAes7t on the short arm and Sr47 and SrAes1t on the long arm of 2S#1 form two linkage groups and at present no rust races are described that can distinguish these resistance specificities.

TI Genetic analysis and detection of the gene MlLX99 on chromosome 2BL

AB The effectiveness of wheat cultivar Liangxing 99 against powdery mildew was shown to be controlled by a single dominant gene located on a new locus of chromosome 2BL in the bin 2BL2-0.35-0.50.
   Liangxing 99, one of the most widely grown commercial cultivars in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) producing regions in northern China, was shown to provide a broad spectrum of resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates originating from that region. Using an F-2 population and F-2:3 lines derived from a cross of Liangxing 99 x Zhongzuo 9504, genetic analysis demonstrated that a single dominant gene, designated MlLX99, was responsible for the resistance of Liangxing 99 to Bgt isolate E09. The results of molecular analysis indicated that this gene is located on chromosome 2BL and flanked by the SSR marker Xgwm120 and EST-STS marker BE604758 at genetic distances of 2.9 and 5.5 cM, respectively. Since the flanking markers of MlLX99 were previously mapped to the bin 2BL2-0.36-0.50, MlLX99 must be located in this chromosomal region. MlLX99 showed a different resistance reaction pattern to 60 Bgt isolates from Pm6, Pm33, and PmJM22, which were all previously mapped on chromosome 2BL, but differed in their positions from MlLX99. Due to its unique position on chromosome 2BL, MlLX99 appears to be a new locus for resistance to powdery mildew. Liangxing 99 has shown superior yield performance and wide adaptation to different agricultural conditions, which has resulted in its extensive use as a wheat cultivar in China. The identification of resistance gene MlLX99 facilitates the use of this cultivar in the protection of wheat from damage caused by powdery mildew.

AB The utilization of dwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b in wheat significantly increased grain yield and contributed to the "green revolution". However, the benefit of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b in drought environments has been debated. Although quantitative trait loci (QTL) for kernel number per spike (KN) and thousand-grain weight (TGW) have been found to be associated with Rht-B1 and Rht-D1, the confounding effect of environmental variation has made a direct association difficult to find. In this study, we used a doubled haploid population (225 lines) of Westonia x Kauz, in which both Rht-B1b (Kauz) and Rht-D1b (Westonia) segregated. The purpose of the study was to determine the interaction of Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 with grain yield components, namely KN and TGW, and to investigate genotype-by-environment interactions in glasshouse and field trials conducted in 2010 and 2011 in Western Australia. A genetic map of 1,156 loci was constructed using 195 microsatellite markers, two gene-based markers for Rht-B1 and Rht-D1, and 959 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The major QTL for TGW and KN were strongly linked to Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 loci and the positive effects were associated with the wild-type alleles, Rht-B1a and Rht-D1a. The major QTL of TGW were on chromosome 2D and 4B. The significant genetic effects (14.6-22.9 %) of TGW indicated that marker-assisted selection for TGW is possible, and markers gwm192a (206 bp) or gwm192b (236 bp) can be used as indicators of high TGW. For KN, one major QTL was detected on chromosome 4D in the analysis across three environments. The association of the wild-type alleles Rht-B1a and Rht-D1a in drought environments is discussed.

AB Yellow or stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, derived from the cross PBW343 x Kenya Kudu, was phenotyped for yellow rust reaction in the field at the CIMMYT research station near Toluca, Mexico, during 2010 and 2011. Segregation results indicated the presence of a race-specific resistance gene, temporarily designated as YrKK, in Kenya Kudu that conferred immunity to adult plants in field trials, despite conferring only slight reductions in seedling reactions in greenhouse tests with three Mexican pathotypes. A minimum of four minor genes having additive effects also segregated in the population and were likely derived from both parents. A total of 635 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were screened for polymorphism surveys on the parents, and resistant (YrKK-possessing RILs) and susceptible (YrKK-lacking RILs) bulks identified four polymorphic markers. These markers were located on the short arm of chromosome 2B. Genotyping of the entire RIL population identified Xgwm148 and Xwmc474 as the most closely linked proximal and distal flanking SSR markers, with respective genetic distances of 3.6 and 1.8 cM from YrKK. Four yellow rust resistance genes (Yr27, Yr31, Yr41, and YrP81) are located on chromosome 2BS; however, their specificity to pathogen pathotypes and host reactions in seedling and adult plants indicate that YrKK is a new resistance gene.

AB Insect pests cause substantial damage to wheat production in many wheat-producing areas of the world. Amongst these, Hessian fly (HF), Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Sunn pest (SP), wheat stem saw fly (WSSF) and cereal leaf beetle (CLB) are the most damaging in the areas where they occur. Historically, the use of resistance genes in wheat has been the most effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-efficient approach to controlling pest infestations. In this study, we carried out a genome-wide association study with 2518 Diversity Arrays Technology markers which were polymorphic on 134 wheat genotypes with varying degrees of resistance to the five most destructive pests (HF, RWA, SP, WSSF and CLB) of wheat, using mixed linear model (MLM) analysis with population structure as a covariate. We identified 26 loci across the wheat genome linked to genes conferring resistance to these pests, of which 20 are potentially novel quantitative trait loci with significance values which ranged between 5 x 10(-3) and 10(-11). We used an in silico approach to identify probable candidate genes at some of the genomic regions and found that their functions varied from defense response with transferase activity to several genes of unknown function. Identification of potentially new loci associated with resistances to pests would contribute to more rapid marker-aided incorporation of new and diverse genes to develop new varieties with improved resistance against these pests.

AB Fusarium culmorum is a haploid, worldwide occurring phytopathogenic fungus causing seedling blight, foot rot, and head blight of cereals and producing the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) associated with health hazards in human and animals. The fungus reproduces asexually by conidiospores, a teleomorph is not known. We analyzed for the first time naturally occurring F. culmorum populations collected randomly in the field from infected wheat heads. A total of 186 isolates, from three populations from Germany (GER), Russia (RUS), Syria (SYR), as well as an international collection (INT) for comparison, were genotyped by 10 microsatellite (SSR, single sequence repeat) markers. A high genetic diversity within the three natural populations and the INT population as well was detected. About 90 % of multi-locus haplotypes (MLH) were unique across populations. The largest part of variance (81 %) was found within populations. Accordingly, population subdivision was low, fixation indices were significant only in one out of six comparisons, while estimates of gene flow (N (m) ) ranged from 0.8-4.8. Linkage equilibrium was revealed by the index of multi-locus association and the quotient of observed and expected variance when two linked markers were deleted. DON and NIV chemotypes grouped closely together in a principle coordinate analysis. SYR isolates were partly separated from GER and RUS populations. All population-genetic parameters were in a similar range compared to those for the sexually propagating species F. graminearum. In conclusion, results support the hypothesis of a recombining structure in F. culmorum as revealed by the high genetic variation within populations, a low fixation index and low gametic phase disequilibrium within populations.

AB Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the allelic composition of Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 loci that comprise the high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits in 15 triticale genotypes. The Glu-A1b allele was detected most frequently (86.7%) at the Glu-A1 locus; the Glu-A1a and Glu-A1c alleles were only found, respectively, in the 'Pawo' and 'Leontino' varieties. Five allelic combinations were detected at Glu-B1 [Glu-B1-1a+2o ( encoding Bx7+By8*), Glu-B1-1a+2s (Bx7+By18*), Glu-B1-1a+2z (Bx7+By20*), Glu-B1-1b+2a (Bx7*+By8) and Glu-B1-1b+2o (Bx7*+By8*)]. The Glu-D1d allele ( HMW subunits 5+10) was observed in breeding lines that carried translocated segments of wheat chromosome 1D. Dough mixing results indicated the Glu-D1d allele provided slight improvements in bread-making quality. Three-year results with Glu-B1b+2o/2a encoding subunits Bx7*+By8/By8* exhibited positive affects in bread-making quality. These subunits were detected in varieties 'Mungis' and 'Pawo'.

AB Three wheat and two barley populations were studied in order to find loci responsible for dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting. A classical quantitative trait loci analysis was combined with an association mapping approach. Many quantitative trait loci and marker trait associations could be detected on all seven chromosome groups of wheat and on the chromosomes 2H, 3H, 5H, 6H, and 7H of barley. Especially, the known regions on chromosomes 3A and 4A for wheat and 5H for barley were confirmed. Putative functions could be found via a candidate homologues search and via expressed sequence tag annotation. On chromosome 3A, the viviparous1 gene is located which is associated to preharvest sprouting and dormancy. On chromosome 4A, a protein is detected which belongs to the aquaporin family. In barley, an association with the aleurain gene on chromosome 5H was found. The expression of aleurain is regulated by abscisic acid and gibberelic acid. An influence of both hormones on dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting is known. It can be concluded that dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting are very complex traits regulated by multigenes and/or quantitative trait loci.

AB A reliable and fast detection of important food plants, such as maize (Zea mays L), wheat (Triticum aestivum L), and soybean (Glycine max L) is of particular interest for food authenticity and safety assessment. In this study, the novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for the rapid qualitative detection of soybean, maize and wheat. To this purpose, new soybean-specific and maize-specific PCR primers were designed. Their specificity was assayed by uniplex PCRs with different plant species, namely maize, soybean, wheat, oats (Avena sativa), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L). Gel electrophoresis of the amplification products demonstrated high specificity of both primer pairs for identification of relevant species. Subsequently, based on the developed DNA markers, the species-specific triplex PCR targeting maize invertase gene, soybean lectin gene and wheat low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit was developed and optimized for simultaneous identification of these three plant species. The developed PCR method enables specific, effective and rapid detection of maize, wheat and soybean and may be used for food analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We used supernetworks with datasets of nuclear gene sequences and novel markers detecting retrotransposon insertions in ribosomal DNA loci to reassess the evolutionary relationships among tetraploid wheats. We show that domesticated emmer has a reticulated genetic ancestry, sharing phylogenetic signals with wild populations from all parts of the wild range. The extent of the genetic reticulation cannot be explained by post-domestication gene flow between cultivated emmer and wild plants, and the phylogenetic relationships among tetraploid wheats are incompatible with simple linear descent of the domesticates from a single wild population. A more parsimonious explanation of the data is that domesticated emmer originates from a hybridized population of different wild lineages. The observed diversity and reticulation patterns indicate that wild emmer evolved in the southern Levant, and that the wild emmer populations in south-eastern Turkey and the Zagros Mountains are relatively recent reticulate descendants of a subset of the Levantine wild populations. Based on our results we propose a new model for the emergence of domesticated emmer. During a pre-domestication period, diverse wild populations were collected from a large area west of the Euphrates and cultivated in mixed stands. Within these cultivated stands, hybridization gave rise to lineages displaying reticulated genealogical relationships with their ancestral populations. Gradual movement of early farmers out of the Levant introduced the pre-domesticated reticulated lineages to the northern and eastern parts of the Fertile Crescent, giving rise to the local wild populations but also facilitating fixation of domestication traits. Our model is consistent with the protracted and dispersed transition to agriculture indicated by the archaeobotanical evidence, and also with previous genetic data affiliating domesticated emmer with the wild populations in southeast Turkey. Unlike other protracted models, we assume that humans played an intuitive role throughout the process.

AB The contribution of cell surface proteins to plant pathogenicity of fungi is not well understood. As such, the objective of this study was to investigate the functions and importance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in the wheat pathogen F. graminearum. GPI-APs are surface proteins that are attached to either the membrane or cell wall. In order to simultaneously disrupt several GPI-APs, a phosphoethanolamine transferase-encoding gene gpi7 was deleted and the resultant mutant characterized in terms of growth, development, and virulence. The Delta gpi7 mutants exhibited slower radial growth rates and aberrantly shaped macroconidia. Furthermore, virulence tests and microscopic analyses indicated that Gpi7 is required for ramification of the fungus throughout the rachis of wheat heads. In parallel, bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict and inventory GPI-APs within the proteome of F. graminearum. Two of the genes identified in this screen (FGSG_01588 and FGSG_08844) displayed isolate-specific length variability as observed for other fungal cell wall adhesion genes. Nevertheless, deletion of these genes failed to reveal obvious defects in growth, development, or virulence. This research demonstrates the global importance of GPI-APs to in planta proliferation in F. graminearum, and also highlights the potential of individual GPI-APs as diagnostic markers.

AB Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a proposed regulator of plant defense signaling in basal resistance and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The GLY1-encoded glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and GLI1-encoded glycerol kinase (GK) are two key enzymes involved in the G3P biosynthesis in plants. However, their physiological importance in wheat defense against pathogens remains unclear. In this study, quantification analysis revealed that G3P levels were significantly induced in wheat leaves challenged by the avirulent Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) race CYR23. The transcriptional levels of TaGLY1 and TaGLI1 were likewise significantly induced by avirulent Pst infection. Furthermore, knocking down TaGLY1 and TaGLI1 individually or simultaneously with barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) inhibited G3P accumulation and compromised the resistance in the wheat cultivar Suwon 11, whereas the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and the expression of the SA-induced marker gene TaPR1 in plant leaves were altered significantly after gene silencing. These results suggested that G3P contributes to wheat systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against stripe rust, and provided evidence that the G3P function as a signaling molecule is conserved in dicots and monocots. Meanwhile, the simultaneous co-silencing of multiple genes by the VIGS system proved to be a powerful tool for multi-gene functional analysis in plants.

AB The disease septoria leaf blotch of wheat, caused by fungal pathogen Septoria tritici, is of worldwide concern. The fungus exhibits a hemibiotrophic lifestyle, with a long symptomless, biotrophic phase followed by a sudden transition to necrotrophy associated with host necrosis. Little is known about the systematic interaction between fungal pathogenicity and host responses at specific growth stages and the factors triggering the transition. In order to gain some insights into global transcriptome alterations in both host and pathogen during the two phases of the compatible interaction, disease transition was monitored using pathogenesis-related gene markers and H2O2 signature prior to RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the slow symptomless growth was accompanied by minor metabolic responses and slightly suppressed defences in the host, whereas necrotrophic growth was associated with enhanced host responses involving energy metabolism, transport, signalling, defence and oxidative stress as well as a decrease in photosynthesis. The fungus expresses distinct classes of stage-specific genes encoding potential effectors, probably first suppressing plant defence responses/facilitating the symptomless growth and later triggering life style transition and inducing host necrosis/facilitating the necrotrophic growth. Transport, signalling, anti-oxidative stress mechanisms and apoplastic nutrient acquisition play important roles in the entire infection process of S. tritici. Our findings uncover systematic S. tritici-induced expression profiles of wheat related to specific fungal infection strategies and provide a transcriptome resource for studying both hosts and pathogens in plant-Dothideomycete interactions.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has a large and highly repetitive genome which poses major technical challenges for its study. To aid map-based cloning and future genome sequencing projects, we constructed a BAC-based physical map of the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A (1AS). From the assembly of 25,918 high information content (HICF) fingerprints from a 1AS-specific BAC library, 715 physical contigs were produced that cover almost 99% of the estimated size of the chromosome arm. The 3,414 BAC clones constituting the minimum tiling path were end-sequenced. Using a gene microarray containing similar to 40 K NCBI UniGene EST clusters, PCR marker screening and BAC end sequences, we arranged 160 physical contigs (97 Mb or 35.3% of the chromosome arm) in a virtual order based on synteny with Brachypodium, rice and sorghum. BAC end sequences and information from microarray hybridisation was used to anchor 3.8 Mbp of Illumina sequences from flow-sorted chromosome 1AS to BAC contigs. Comparison of genetic and synteny-based physical maps indicated that similar to 50% of all genetic recombination is confined to 14% of the physical length of the chromosome arm in the distal region. The 1AS physical map provides a framework for future genetic mapping projects as well as the basis for complete sequencing of chromosome arm 1AS.

AB Background: The common ancestor of salmonid fishes, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), experienced a whole genome duplication between 20 and 100 million years ago, and many of the duplicated genes have been retained in the trout genome. This retention complicates efforts to detect allelic variation in salmonid fishes. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection is problematic because nucleotide variation can be found between the duplicate copies (paralogs) of a gene as well as between alleles.
   Results: We present a method of differentiating between allelic and paralogous (gene copy) sequence variants, allowing identification of SNPs in organisms with multiple copies of a gene or set of genes. The basic strategy is to: 1) identify windows of unique cDNA sequences with homology to each other, 2) compare these unique cDNAs if they are not shared between individuals (i.e. the cDNA is homozygous in one individual and homozygous for another cDNA in the other individual), and 3) give a "SNP score" value between zero and one to each candidate sequence variant based on six criteria. Using this strategy we were able to detect about seven thousand potential SNPs from the transcriptomes of several clonal lines of rainbow trout. When directly compared to a pre-validated set of SNPs in polyploid wheat, we were also able to estimate the false-positive rate of this strategy as 0 to 28% depending on parameters used.
   Conclusions: This strategy has an advantage over traditional techniques of SNP identification because another dimension of sequencing information is utilized. This method is especially well suited for identifying SNPs in polyploids, both outbred and inbred, but would tend to be conservative for diploid organisms.

AB In this study, one rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to determine the genetic characteristics of seed reserve utilization during the early (day 6), middle (day 10) and late (day 14) germination stages. The seedling dry weight (SDW) and weight of the mobilized seed reserve (WMSR) were increased, while the seed reserve utilization efficiency (SRUE) decreased, during the process of seed germination. The SDW and WMSR were affected by the seed weight, while the SRUE was not affected by the seed weight. A total of twenty unconditional and twenty-one conditional additive QTLs and eight epistatic QTLs were identified at three germination stages, and the more QTLs were expressed at the late germination stage. Among them, twelve additive and three epistatic QTLs for SDW, eight additive and three epistatic QTLs for WMSR and thirteen additive and two epistatic QTLs for SRUE were identified, respectively. The phenotypic variation explained by each additive QTL, epistatic QTL and QTL x development interaction ranged from 6.10 to 23.91%, 1.79 to 6.88% and 0.22 to 2.86%, respectively. Two major additive QTLs qWMSR7.1 and qSRUE4.3 were identified, and each QTL could explain more than 20% of the total phenotypic variance. By comparing the chromosomal positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, eleven QTLs might represent novel genes. The best four cross combinations of each trait for the development of RIL populations were selected. The selected RILs and the identified QTLs might be applicable to improve rice seed reserve utilization by the marker-assisted selection approach.

AB A highly virulent form of the wheat stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK is virulent on both wheat and barley, presenting a major threat to world food security. The recessive and temperature-sensitive rpg4 gene is the only effective source of resistance identified in barley (Hordewn vulgare) against P graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. Efforts to position clone rpg4 localized resistance to a small interval on barley chromosome 5HL, tightly linked to the rye stem rust (P. graminis f. sp. secalis) resistance (R) gene Rpg5. High-resolution genetic analysis and post-transcriptional gene silencing of the genes at the rpg41Rpg5 locus determined that three tightly linked genes (Rpg5, HvRga1, and HvAdf3) are required together for rpg4-mediated wheat stem rust resistance. Alleles of the three genes were analyzed from a diverse set of 14 domesticated barley lines (H. vulgare) and 8 wild barley accessions (H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum) to characterize diversity that may determine incompatibility (resistance). The analysis determined that HvAdf3 and HvRga1 code for predicted functional proteins that do not appear to contain polymorphisms determining the compatible (susceptible) interactions with the wheat stem rust pathogen and were expressed at the transcriptional level from both resistant and susceptible barley lines. The HvAdf3 alleles shared 100% amino acid identity among all 22 genotypes examined. The P. graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ-susceptible barley lines with HvRga1 alleles containing the limited amino acid substitutions unique to the susceptible varieties also contained predicted nonfunctional rpg5 alleles. Thus, susceptibility in these lines is likely due to the nonfunctional RPG5 proteins. The Rpg5 allele analysis determined that 9 of the 13 P graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ-susceptible barley lines contain alleles that either code for predicted truncated proteins as the result of a single nucleotide substitution, resulting in a stop codon at amino acid 161, a single cytosine indel causing a frame shift, and a stop codon at amino acid 217, or an indel that deleted the entire STPK domain. The three P graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ-susceptible lines (Swiss landraces Hv489, Hv492, and Hv611) and the wild barley accession WBDC160 contain rpg5 alleles predicted to encode full-length proteins containing a nonsynonomous nucleotide substitution that results in the amino acid substitution E1287A. This amino acid substitution present in the uncharacterized C-terminal domain is not found in any resistant line and may be important to elicit the resistance reaction. These data suggest that rpg4-mediated resistance against many wheat stem rust pathogen races, including P graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK, rely on the Rpg5 R gene; thus, rpg4- and Rpg5-mediated resistance rely on a common R gene and should not be considered completely distinct. The data also determined that Rpg5 gene-specific molecular markers could be used to detect rpg4-mediated wheat stem rust resistance for marker-assisted selection.

AB Powdery mildew (Oidium lini Skoric, [PM]), an obligate biotrophic ascomycete, is a common and widespread foliar disease of flax in most flax-growing areas of the world. In this study, we constructed a linkage map using 143 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and an F-2 population of 300 individuals generated from a cross between the susceptible cultivar NorMan and the resistant cultivar Linda. The F-2-derived F-3 families were phenotyped in the field and the F-3-derived F-4 families were phenotyped in a controlled environment growth chamber. The 15 linkage group map covered 1241 cM and was largely collinear with the previously published consensus map. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed and three PM resistance QTL located on LG1, 7, and 9 were identified consistently using phenotyping data from both field and growth chamber studies. These QTL explained 97% of the phenotypic variation exhibiting a mainly dominant gene action. This work represents a first step toward understanding the genetics of PM resistance in flax and map-based cloning of candidate genes underlying the QTL.

AB Breakdown of leaf proteins, particularly chloroplast proteins, is a massive process in senescing leaves. In spite of its importance in internal N recycling, the mechanism(s) and the enzymes involved are largely unknown. Senescence-associated vacuoles (SAVs) are small, acidic vacuoles with high cysteine peptidase activity. Chloroplast-targeted proteins re-localize to SAVs during senescence, suggesting that SAVs might be involved in chloroplast protein degradation. SAVs were undetectable in mature, non-senescent tobacco leaves. Their abundance, visualized either with the acidotropic marker Lysotracker Red or by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence in a line expressing the senescence-associated cysteine protease SAG12 fused to GFP, increased during senescence induction in darkness, and peaked after 2-4 d, when chloroplast dismantling was most intense. Increased abundance of SAVs correlated with higher levels of SAG12 mRNA. Activity labelling with a biotinylated derivative of the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 was used to detect active cysteine proteases. The two apparently most abundant cysteine proteases of senescing leaves, of 40 kDa and 33 kDa were detected in isolated SAVs. Rubisco degradation in isolated SAVs was completely blocked by E-64. Treatment of leaf disks with E-64 in vivo substantially reduced degradation of Rubisco and leaf proteins. Overall, these results indicate that SAVs contain most of the cysteine protease activity of senescing cells, and that SAV cysteine proteases are at least partly responsible for the degradation of stromal proteins of the chloroplast.

AB Polyploidization is a major force that has shaped the evolution of flowering plants. Newly-generated polyploids have been used to investigate the changes that occur in genomes immediately after polyploidization. The present research programme created colchitetraploids in Phlox drummondii and followed them through different generations (C-0, C-1, C-2, and C-3) to determine genomic changes. Genomic changes that followed autopolyploidization were investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technologies. The markers for which variation was evident were characterized by cloning and sequencing. Dot-blotting was used to confirm increased or decreased abundance of the fragments for which variation was noted. We used bisulfite sequencing to determine changes in the levels of DNA methylation in the vicinities of the fragments that show variation. Our data indicate that these areas were more methylated in C-2 and C-3 colchitetraploids than in C-0 and C-1 colchitetraploids. The overall levels of methylation polymorphism found in C-2 and C-3 colchitetraploids were 1.0% and 1.65%, respectively. Changes were observed in both coding and noncoding regions. Some MSAP fragments that showed variation were similar to retrotransposons. Bisulfite sequencing indicated that CHH sites accounted for all the observed variation, whereas CG and CHG did not show any variation. The present study suggests that the genomic changes that accompany polyploidization in synthetic autopolyploids resemble those in allopolyploids. However, the extent of variation is lower in synthetic autopolyploids than in allopolyploids. These changes may help in the stabilization of the genomes of neo-autopolyploids.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 591-605.

AB The aim of the present work was to study chromosomal polymorphism within cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) using three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The physical distribution of the most frequently used, highly repetitive DNA sequences (GAA)(7) specific for pericentromeric heterochromatic regions, the ribosomal DNA clone pTa71, specific for the 45S rDNA, and the barley-specific telomere-associated sequence HvT01, was investigated to reveal genetic diversity in metaphase spreads of ten barley genotypes with diverse geographical origin, growth habit and row number. A wild relative of barley, Hordeum chilense was also studied in order to compare the polymorphism between and within Hordeum species. Significant differences in the hybridization patterns of all three DNA probes could be detected between the two related species, but only probes pTa71 and HvT01 showed variation in the intensity and/or position of hybridization sites among genotypes of H. vulgare ssp. vulgare. The extent of polymorphism was less than that earlier reported for molecular markers and was restricted to the long chromosome arms, with differences between the chromosomes. 1H and 3H proved to be the most variable chromosomes and 4H and 6H the most conserved.

AB Fusarium avenaceum is one of the most important pathogenic species in agricultural and forest environments of moderate climate, particularly in cereals and legume pulse crops. Numerous mycotoxins can be synthesized by the species, with moniliformin and enniatins (ENN) being the prevailing metabolites. The aims of this work were to examine the amounts of ENN and beauvericin present in naturally contaminated field samples of wheat kernels and chaffs collected in Poland in 2005 and 2009 from heads infected with E avenaceum, and to reveal the divergence of the esyn1 gene among E avenaceum strains of different origin. ENN-B and ENN-B-1 were the major metabolites identified in wheat field samples. Chaff fractions contained significantly more mycotoxins than grain. Samples originating from 2005 were in general less contaminated with ENN than those from the 2009 season. The highest amount of ENN-B found in grain was 28,520 mu g/kg. Beauvericin was only found in trace amounts in all the samples tested. E avenaceum strains isolated from the analysed wheat samples were identified using species-specific DNA marker and translation elongation factor la (tef-1 alpha) sequence analysis. A higher level of sequence polymorphism was revealed for the enniatin synthetase (esyn1) gene than ecorded by tef-1 alpha analysis. Moreover, species known to be typical beauvericin producers, e.g. Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium proliferatum, were clustered into a separate branch on the dendrogram, apart from the strains of ENN-producing species, i.e. E avenaceum and Fusarium scirpi.

AB The wild species, Secale africanum Stapf., serves as a valuable germplasm resource for increasing the diversity of cultivated rye (Secale cereale L.) and providing novel genes for wheat improvement. The objective of this study was to identify new wheat-S. africanum chromosome 2R(afr) derivatives by molecular markers and in situ hybridization, and to test the effects of centric translocations of S. africanum chromosome 2R(afr) on disease resistance and agronomic performance of wheat. The T2R(afr)S.2DL and T2DS.2R(afr)L translocations, and other S. africanum chromosome introgressions such as a 2R(afr) substitution as well as monotelo-2R(afr)S and 2R(afr)L addition lines, were identified by the genomic in situ hybridization and sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Twenty-three molecular markers were localized on chromosome 2R(afr) arms which will facilitate future identification of their introgressions into wheat. A comparison of FISH patterns and the molecular marker distribution between the S. africanum chromosome 2R(afr) and cultivated rye chromosome 2R indicates differentiation between the wild and cultivated Secale genomes. Tests of disease resistance and agronomic performance of wheat-S. africanum chromosome 2R(afr) derivatives indicated that chromosome 2R(afr)L carried gene(s) for dwarfing and stripe rust resistance, while the 2R(afr)S translocation line was the most favorable for agronomic performance when compared with the substitution and 2R(afr)L translocation lines. These results encourage the continued use of novel wheat-S. africanum 2R(afr) derivative lines in wheat improvement.

AB Marker-trait associations identified in diverse germplasm can be exploited in crop improvement programs. An attempt to establish such associations was made by evaluating 205 wheat landraces for stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust responses in the field over three crop seasons. Diversity arrays technology was used to genotype the landraces and associations were identified using a single-marker scan. Sixty-eight markers were significantly associated with rust resistance. Several significantly associated loci coincided with the presence of known major genes or QTL for rust resistance. In contrast, many marker-rust response associations identified in this analysis for each of the three rust diseases uncovered new loci. Dual associations; stripe rust-leaf rust (1AL, 2BS, 2BL, 3DL, 5BS, 6BS and 7DL), leaf rust-stem rust (5BL) and stripe rust-stem rust (4BL and 6AS) resistance were also observed. These associations could enable a cost-effective targeted mapping of dual rust resistance. Some marker-trait associations identified in this study have been validated through genetic analyses and formal naming of resistance loci.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour functionality during the dough development and baking processes is an important quality attribute considered by the baking industry. A flour with high water absorption during mixing means more water and less flour is needed, compared to a flour with less water absorption. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing water absorption and dough rheological properties of hard red spring wheat. QTL were mapped on a genetic linkage map that comprised 531 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and diversity array technology (DArT) marker loci. Composite interval mapping with 139 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to identify QTL within and across two field environments. Six QTL on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 4B, 4D, and 5A were detected for farinograph water absorption. These QTL also confirmed earlier studies that flour water absorption is a function of protein content, starch damage, and gluten strength. In this study, dough rheological properties such as dough development time, dough stability, mixing tolerance index, and time to breakdown were influenced by the high-molecular weight glutenin genes Glu-B1 and Glu-D1.

AB Background: The potential impact of genetically modified (GM) plants on human health has attracted much attention worldwide, and the issue remains controversial. This is in sharp contrast to the broad acceptance of plants produced by breeding through Marker Assisted Backcrossing (MAB).
   Results: Focusing on transcriptome variation and perturbation to signaling pathways, we assessed the molecular and biological aspects of substantial equivalence, a general principle for food safety endorsed by the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization, between a transgenic crop and a plant from MAB breeding. We compared a transgenic rice line (DXT) and a MAB rice line (DXB), both of which contain the gene Xa21 providing resistance to bacterial leaf blight. By using Next-Generation sequencing data of DXT, DXB and their parental line (D62B), we compared the transcriptome variation of DXT and DXB. Remarkably, DXT had 43% fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than DXB. The genes exclusively expressed in DXT and in DXB have pathogen and stress defense functions. Functional categories of DEGs in DXT were comparable to that in DXB, and seven of the eleven pathways significantly affected by transgenesis were also perturbed by MAB breeding.
   Conclusions: These results indicated that the transgenic rice and rice from MAB breeding are substantial equivalent at the transcriptome level, and paved a way for further study of transgenic rice, e. g., understanding the chemical and nutritional properties of the DEGs identified in the current study.

AB Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are one of the most popular sources of genetic markers and play a significant role in plant genetics and breeding. In this study, we identified citrus SSRs in the genome of Clementine mandarin and analyzed their frequency and distribution in different genomic regions. A total of 80,708 SSRs were detected in the genome with an overall density of 268 SSRs/Mb. While di-nucleotide repeats were the most frequent microsatellites in genomic DNA sequence, tetra-nucleotides, which had more repeat units than any other SSR types, had the highest cumulative sequence length. We identified 6,834 transcripts as containing 8,989 SSRs in 33,929 Clementine mandarin transcripts, among which, tri-nucleotide motifs (36.0%) were the most common, followed by di-nucleotide (26.9%) and hexa-nucleotide motifs (15.1%). The motif AG (16.7%) was most abundant among these SSRs, while motifs AAG (6.6%), AAT (5.0%), and TAG (2.2%) were most common among tri-nucleotides. Functional categorization of transcripts containing SSRs revealed that 5,879 (86.0%) of such transcripts had homology with known proteins, GO and KEGG annotation revealed that transcripts containing SSRs were those implicated in diverse biological processes in plants, including binding, development, transcription, and protein degradation. When 27 genomic and 78 randomly selected SSRs were tested on Clementine mandarin, 95 SSRs revealed polymorphism. These 95 SSRs were further deployed on 18 genotypes of the three generas of Rutaceae for the genetic diversity assessment, genomic SSRs generally show low transferability in comparison to SSRs developed from expressed sequences. These transcript-markers identified in our study may provide a valuable genetic and genomic tool for further genetic research and varietal development in citrus, such as diversity study, QTL mapping, molecular breeding, comparative mapping and other genetic analyses.

AB Background: Flavonoids are an important class of secondary compounds in angiosperms. Next to certain biological functions in plants, they play a role in the brewing process and have an effect on taste, color and aroma of beer. The aim of this study was to reveal the haplotype diversity of candidate genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in cultivated barley varieties (Hordeum vulgare L.) and to determine associations to kernel and malting quality parameters.
   Results: Five genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway were partially resequenced in 16 diverse barley reference genotypes. Their localization in the barley genome, their genetic structure, and their genetic variation e. g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and Insertion/Deletion (InDel) patterns were revealed. In total, 130 SNPs and seven InDels were detected. Of these, 21 polymorphisms were converted into high-throughput pyrosequencing markers. The resulting SNP and haplotype patterns were used to calculate associations with kernel and malting quality parameters.
   Conclusions: SNP patterns were found to be highly variable for the investigated genes. The developed high-throughput markers are applicable for assessing the genetic variability and for the determination of haplotype patterns in a set of barley accessions. The candidate genes PAL, C4H and F3H were shown to be associated to several malting properties like glassiness (PAL), viscosity (C4H) or to final attenuation (F3H).

AB The ditelosomic line for the long arm of chromosome 4B (4BL) of Chinese Spring (CS) wheat is not available because it is completely male sterile. Since all deletions in the 4B short arm (4BS) cause male sterility in the homozygous condition, a male-fertility gene should be located in a distal region of 4BS. Among the selfed progeny of a hybrid between a male-sterile 4BS deletion plant (4BS-8) and a Japanese common wheat cultivar Norin 61 (N61), we obtained self-fertile 4BS-8 homozygous deletion plants. We also found fertile nullisomic-4B plants among the selfed progeny of a hybrid between a monosomic line 4B of N61 and CS. This fact suggested that N61 has a novel male-fertility gene on a chromosome other than 4B. We established a self-fertile ditelosomic 4BL line after backcrossing a fertile 4BS-8 plant to CS monotelodisomic 4BL. By cytological observation and PCR analysis using 16 SSR markers, we verified that this ditelosomic line lacked the entire 4BS arm and found that three of the markers were on 4BS. We conducted deletion mapping using three 4BS homozygous deletion lines and three 4BS-specific markers.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola, is one of the most ubiquitous and important diseases of bread wheat worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify markers linked to loci conferring resistance to STB from seven biparental populations. Linkage analysis, meta-analysis and association mapping were combined to identify robust quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance. Linkage analysis led to the detection of 115 QTLs for resistance to STB and 66 QTLs linked to plant height and/or earliness. Meta-analysis clustered these 115 QTLs into 27 Meta-QTLs (MQTLs) of pathogen resistance, of which 14 were found to be linked to plant height and/or earliness. Both the relationship between dwarfing and susceptibility to STB and the significant negative correlation between earliness and STB symptoms were confirmed. Eleven loci were linked to STB resistance by association mapping using a general linear model and/or a mixed linear model, of which eight co-located with STB MQTLs and two co-located with individual QTLs. Associated markers located in MQTL regions enhanced the relevance of the results and validated the potential of an association mapping approach. With several biparental populations, meta-analysis is the most relevant form of genetic analysis study, but association mapping can be used as a validation method. Regions linked to resistance in both methods should be relevant for use in breeding programs for improving resistance to STB in wheat varieties. The main interest in comparing both approaches is to detect robust loci that will be functional in many genetic backgrounds rather than just in one or a few specific backgrounds.

AB Genetic resistance is the most effective approach to managing wheat leaf rust. The aim of this study was to characterize seedling and adult plant leaf rust resistance of a world wheat collection. Using controlled inoculation with ten races of Puccinia triticina, 14 seedling resistance genes were determined or postulated to be present in the collection. Lr1, Lr3, Lr10 and Lr20 were the most prevalent genes around the world while Lr9, Lr14b, Lr3ka and/or Lr30 and Lr26 were rare. To confirm some gene postulations, the collection was screened with gene-specific molecular markers for Lr1, Lr10, Lr21 and Lr34. Although possessing the Lr1 and/or Lr10 gene-specific marker, 51 accessions showed unexpected high infection types to P. triticina race BBBD. The collection was tested in the field, where rust resistance ranged from nearly immune or highly resistant with severity of 1 % and resistant host response to highly susceptible with severity of 84 % and susceptible host response. The majority of the accessions possessing the adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr34 had a maximum rust severity of 0-35 %, similar to or better than accession RL6058, a Thatcher-Lr34 near-isogenic line. Many accessions displayed an immune response or a high level of resistance under field conditions, likely as a result of synergy between APR genes or between APR and seedling resistance genes. However, accessions with three or more seedling resistance genes had an overall lower field severity than those with two or fewer. Immune or highly resistant accessions are potential sources for improvement of leaf rust resistance. In addition, some lines were postulated to have known but unidentified genes/alleles or novel genes, also constituting potentially important sources of novel resistance.

AB Flag smut, caused by Urocystis agropyri, has been a problem in wheat production, but its incidence has declined with the use of resistant varieties and seed dressing. Diamondbird, an Australian wheat cultivar that carries high levels of resistance to flag smut, was crossed with susceptible Chinese landrace TH3929 and a doubled haploid (DH) population was developed. A linkage map comprising 386 markers was used for detection of genomic regions controlling flag smut resistance. Composite interval mapping identified five quantitative trait loci (QTL) with significant effects for flag smut resistance. QTL QFs.sun-3AL, QFs.sun-6AS, QFs.sun-1BL and QFs.sun-5BS were contributed by Diamondbird. Although TH3929 was susceptible, it contributed a minor QTL QFs.sun-3AS. QTL QFs.sun-3AL and QFs.sun-6AS were detected in both seasons and each explained more than 17 % of the variation in flag smut response. Other QTL QFs.sun-3AS, QFs.sun-1BL and QFs.sun-5BS explained 5-10 % of the phenotypic variation. DH lines that showed low flag smut levels carried combinations of three or more QTL. This is the first report on chromosomal location of flag smut resistance in a modern common wheat cultivar.

AB Two bread wheat lines each with a translocation on chromosome 7DL from either Thinopyrum intermedium (TC5 and TC14) or Thinopyrum ponticum (T4m), were hybridized in a ph1b mutant background to enhance recombination between the two translocated chromosomal segments. The frequency of recombinants was high in lines derived from the larger and similar-sized translocations (TC5/T4m), but much lower when derived from different-sized translocations (TC14/T4m). Recombinant translocations contained combinations of resistance genes Bdv2, Lr19 and Sr25 conferring resistance to Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), leaf rust and stem rust, respectively. Their genetic composition was identified using bioassays and molecular markers specific for the two progenitor Thinopyrum species. This set of 7DL Th. ponticum/intermedium recombinant translocations was termed the Pontin series. In addition to Thinopyrum markers, the size of the translocation was estimated with the aid of wheat markers mapped on each of the 7DL deletion bins. Bioassays for BYDV, leaf rust and stem rust were performed under greenhouse and field conditions. Once separated from ph1b background, the Pontin recombinant translocations were stable and showed normal inheritance in successive backcrosses. The reported Pontin translocations integrate important resistance genes in a single linkage block which will allow simultaneous selection of disease resistance. Combinations of Bdv2 + Lr19 or Lr19 + Sr25 in both long and short translocations, are available to date. The smaller Pontins, comprising only 20 % of the distal portion of 7DL, will be most attractive to breeders.

AB Aegilops tauschii, the diploid progenitor of the wheat D genome, is a readily accessible germplasm pool for wheat breeding as genes can be transferred to elite wheat cultivars through direct hybridization followed by backcrossing. Gene transfer and genetic mapping can be integrated by developing mapping populations during backcrossing. Using direct crossing, two genes for resistance to the African stem rust fungus race TTKSK (Ug99), were transferred from the Ae. tauschii accessions TA10187 and TA10171 to an elite hard winter wheat line, KS05HW14. BC2 mapping populations were created concurrently with developing advanced backcross lines carrying rust resistance. Bulked segregant analysis on the BC2 populations identified marker loci on 6DS and 7DS linked to stem rust resistance genes transferred from TA10187 and TA10171, respectively. Linkage maps were developed for both genes and closely linked markers reported in this study will be useful for selection and pyramiding with other Ug99-effective stem rust resistance genes. The Ae. tauschii-derived resistance genes were temporarily designated SrTA10187 and SrTA10171 and will serve as valuable resources for stem rust resistance breeding.

AB In the soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) regions of the US, Fusarium head blight (FHB, caused by Fusarium spp.) resistance derived from locally adapted germplasm has been used predominantly. Two soft red winter wheat cultivars, Massey and Ernie, have moderate resistance to FHB. Mapping populations derived from Becker/Massey (B/M) and Ernie/MO 94-317 (E/MO) were evaluated for FHB resistance and other traits in multiple environments. Eight QTL in B/M and five QTL in E/MO were associated with FHB variables including incidence, severity (SEV), index (IND), Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK), deoxynivalenol (DON), and morphological traits flowering time and plant height. Four QTL were common to both populations. Three of them were located at or near known genes: Ppd-D1 on chromosome 2DS, Rht-B1 on 4BS, and Rht-D1 on 4DS. Alleles for dwarf plant height (Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b) and photoperiod insensitivity (Ppd-D1a) had pleiotropic effects in reducing height and increasing FHB susceptibility. The other QTL detected for FHB variables were on 3BL in both populations, 1AS, 1DS, 2BL, and 4DL in B/M, and 5AL (B1) and 6AL in E/MO. The additive effects of FHB variables ranged from 0.4 mg kg(-1) of DON to 6.2 % for greenhouse (GH) SEV in B/M and ranged from 0.3 mg kg(-1) of DON to 8.3 % for GH SEV in E/MO. The 4DS QTL had epistasis with Ppd-D1, Qdon.umc-6AL, and Qht.umc-4BS, and additive x additive x environment interactions with the 4BS QTL for SEV, IND, and FDK in E/MO. Marker-assisted selection might be used to enhance FHB resistance through selection of favorable alleles of significant QTL, taking into account genotypes at Rht-B1b, Rht-D1a and Ppd-D1a.

AB A study on marker-assisted selection (MAS) for the rf1 gene, which controls pollen sterility in the sorghum A1 cytoplasm, was conducted on the offspring population of two crosses between a maintainer line, BTx-622, and two sweet sorghum lines, BJ-299 and Lunen-2, to test the effectiveness of the MAS method and develop maintainer lines with sweet and juicy stalks and corresponding cytoplasmic-nuclear male sterility (CMS) lines. The simple sequence repeat marker Xtxp18 exhibited a high accuracy (95.098 %) for selecting recessive homozygotes for the rf1 gene. The segregation ratio matched the expected ratio calculated according to the reported genetic distance in the F-2 population of the two crosses used. Finally, four excellent maintainer lines/CMS line pairs (F-5/BC3) with high stalk juice and stalk juice sugar contents were developed. The MAS method based on Xtxp18 for the sorghum rf1 gene could be used for hybrid breeding programs at a low cost in the future.

AB Folate transporters, including the reduced folate carrier and the proton-coupled folate transporter, encoded by Slc19a1 and Slc46a1 genes respectively, play important roles in the transport of folate across biological membranes given the hydrophilic nature of folates. Although a number of studies have demonstrated that these two transporters are regulated ontogenetically in mammals, little data are available on their developmental patterns of expression in poultry. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of Slc19a1 and Slc46a1 in jejunal and cecal tissue of broiler chickens during post-hatching development. Post-hatch male chicks (Ross x Ross) had free access to water and a soybean/wheat-based diet. Jejunal, cecal and blood samples were collected on day-of-hatch but before feeding (DO), and on D2, D7, D14, D21 and D35 post-hatch (n = 8 at each time point), respectively. Plasma folate concentrations were low on the day of hatch and increased with maturation; by contrast, plasma homocysteine, a marker of folate status, was highest (P < 0.05) in the day-of-hatch birds and decreased thereafter. Increasing age reduced mRNA abundance of Slc19a1 (P < 0.05) in the jejunum and cecum. Abundance of Slc46a1 mRNA (P < 0.05) gradually decreased in the cecum with increasing age and that of Slc46a1 in the jejunum initially decreased and then increased to level similar to that of day-of-hatch. The study provides some initial data on ontogenetic regulation of Slc19a1 and Slc46a1 in the jejunum and cecum of the chicken and lays the ground work for future nutritional studies. Moreover, the expression of Slc19a1 and Slc46a1 transcripts in the cecum provides evidence of the potential for cecally derived folate to contribute to the folate status of the host.

AB In higher plants, seed storage proteins (SSPs) are frequently expressed from complex gene families, and allelic variation of SSP genes often affects the quality traits of crops. In common wheat, the Glu-D1 locus, encoding 1Dx and 1Dy SSPs, has multiple alleles. The Glu-D1d allele frequently confers superior end-use qualities to commercial wheat varieties. Here, we studied the haplotype structure of Glu-D1 genomic region and the origin of Glu-D1d. Using seven diagnostic DNA markers, 12 Glu-D1 haplotypes were detected among common wheat, European spelt wheat (T. spelta, a primitive hexaploid relative of common wheat), and Aegilops tauschii (the D genome donor of hexaploid wheat). By comparatively analyzing Glu-D1 haplotypes and their associated 1Dx and 1Dy genes, we deduce that the haplotype carrying Glu-D1d was likely differentiated in the ancestral hexaploid wheat around 10,000 years ago, and was subsequently transmitted to domesticated common wheat and T. spelta. A group of relatively ancient Glu-D1 haplotypes was discovered in Ae. tauschii, which may serve for the evolution of other haplotypes. Moreover, a number of new Glu-D1d variants were found in T. spelta. The main steps in Glu-D1d differentiation are proposed. The implications of our work for enhancing the utility of Glu-D1d in wheat quality improvement and studying the SSP alleles in other crop species are discussed.

AB TRAP is a novel molecular marker technique which has been effectively used in genetic diversity analysis of germplasm and genetic mapping. However, it has not yet been applied to radish. In this study, novel TRAP markers based on expressed sequence tag (EST) and resistance gene analog (RGAs) were developed and applied to the genetic diversity analysis of radish genotypes. With data-mining method, a total of 50 RGAs including 35 unigenes and 15 singletons were identified from the public sequence databases and employed to design the fixed primers of TRAP markers Fifty-nine RGA-derived fixed primers were combined with five arbitrary primers, and these TRAP primer combinations were tested in two genotypes ('NAU-YH' and 'NAU-DY'). Furthermore, 65 TRAP primer combinations were selected for genetic diversity analysis and 385 polymorphic fragments were produced among 30 radish genotypes. Dendrograms constructed by UPGMA method showed that these genotypes could be clustered into four groups. Interestingly, these groups were in highly accordance with the results of resistance evaluation to Turnip Mosaic Virus (TuMV). A cultivar identification diagram (CID) was made manually to discriminate the 30 radish genotypes using four polymorphic TRAP primer combinations. The results indicated that TRAP is an efficient genetic marker system, which could provide an effective tool for genetic mapping and for marker-assisted selection in radish breeding programs.

AB Background: An adaptive mechanism in plant roots is initiated in the event of nitrogen and potassium deficiency, and it facilitates the active uptake of these elements in order to ensure plant growth and survival in stress conditions. Signaling and transduction of signals in response to changing nitrogen and potassium concentrations is a complex process, affected by interactions between various gene expression products, and often subjected to modifications.
   Results: In order to identify genotypic differences between phenotypes of two populations of recombinant inbred rye lines (153/79-1 x Ot1-3 and Ot0-6 x Ot1-3) in response to nutrition stress caused by nitrogen and potassium deficiency at the seedling stage, bulk segregant analysis was utilized. Identification of genotypic differences between and within pooled DNA samples involved 424 RAPD, 120 ISSR primers and 50 combinations of R-ISSR. Identified markers were sequenced and converted to SCAR, attributing to them unique ESTs annotations, and chromosomal ones to selected localizations. Significant relationships with the examined trait were described for nine and eight RAPD markers, four and five ISSR, one and three R-ISSR markers for population 153/79-1 x Ot1-3 and Ot0-6 x Ot1-3, respectively. Sequences identified for the rye genome were characterized by a uniqueness and a similarity to the sequence of aquaporin PIP1, a gene encoding protein related to the function of the transcription factor in plant response to iron deficiency and the putative ethylene-responsive transcription factor, cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HvHKT1 transporter, as well as HCBT proteins.
   Conclusion: Identified molecular markers differentiating rye genotypes of extreme response of root system on nitrogen and potassium deficiency play a significant role in systemic plant response to stress, including stress caused by nitrogen and potassium deficiency. They may constitute a system facilitating selection, and together with the material they are described in, they may be a starting point for research on mechanisms of sensing and transduction of signal across the plant.

AB Background: In order to evaluate the variation among different rice types, the genetic diversity in a rice collection composed by 59 breeding lines, 23 landraces, 18 weedy rice lines, and 35 introduced lines that collected from countries worldwide was analyzed using 134 simple sequence repeat markers.
   Results: In total, 1264 alleles were identified (average, 9.43 per locus). Rare alleles made up a large portion (58.4%) of the detected alleles, and 29 unique alleles associated with rice accessions were also discovered. A model-based structural analysis revealed the presence of three subpopulations. The genetic relationships revealed by the neighbour-joining tree method were fairly consistent with the structure-based membership assignments for most of the accessions. A total of 105 accessions (79.5%) showed a clear relationship to each cluster, while the remaining 27 accessions (20.5%) were categorized as admixtures. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and distributions are of fundamental importance for genome-wide association mapping. The mean r(2) value for all intrachromosomal loci pairs was 0.1286. The LD between linked markers decreased with the genetic distance between pairs of linked loci.
   Conclusions: These results will provide an effective aid for future allele mining, association genetics, mapping and cloning gene(s), germplasm conservation, and improvement programs.

AB Background: Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is essential for sporozoite formation and sporozoite invasion into human hepatocyte. Previously, a recombinant P. vivax CSP based on chimeric repeats (rPvCSP-c) representing two major alleles VK210 and VK247 within central region has been designed. Naturally acquired humoral immune responses study show that antigenicity of rPvCSP-c was much higher than that of native strain. However, the serologic reactivity of rPvCSP-c was still unclear in detail.
   Methods: In present study, recognition of rPvCSP-c in vivax malaria typed VK210 and VK247 alleles was assessed. VK210 typed and VK247 typed sera from adult residents reacted specifically with rPvCSP-c using protein array and immunoblot assay. Additionally, anti-rPvCSP-c serum recognized the fixed VK210 and VK247 sporozoites by immunofluorescence assay. Furthermore, statistic analysis was performed for correlational detection.
   Results: The rPvCSP-c reacted with both VK210 typed and VK247 typed P. vivax infected patient sera and anti-rPvCSP-c immune serum also reacted with VK210 and VK247 sporozoite parasites of P. vivax specifically. There was a positive correlation between increased antibody level, age of patients and also associated with pvcsp repeat number, although the level of responses did vary considerably in their reactivity to the rPvCSP-c from negative to very high level within each age group.
   Conclusions: These data confirmed the serologic reactivity of the novel rPvCSP-c in exposed both VK210 and VK247 populations. These results strongly suggested that this recombinant CSP was biologically active and potently immunogenic across major strains and raised the prospect that this protein could be used as serologic marker.

AB Background: Grain texture is one of the most important characteristics in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Puroindoline-D1 genes play the main role in controlling grain texture and are intimately associated with the milling and processing qualities in bread wheat.
   Results: A series of diagnostic molecular markers and dCAPS markers were used to characterize Pina-D1 and Pinb-D1 in 493 wheat cultivars from diverse geographic locations. A primer walking strategy was used to characterize PINA-null alleles at the DNA level. Results indicated that Chinese landraces encompassing 12 different Puroindoline-D1 allelic combinations showed the highest diversity, while CIMMYT wheat cultivars containing 3 different Puroindoline-D1 allelic combinations showed the lowest diversity amongst wheat cultivars from the five countries surveyed. Two novel Pina-D1 alleles, designated Pina-D1s with a 4,422-bp deletion and Pina-D1u with a 6,460-bp deletion in the Ha (Hardness) locus, were characterized at the DNA level by a primer walking strategy, and corresponding molecular markers Pina-N3 and Pina-N4 were developed for straightforward identification of the Pina-D1s and Pina-D1u alleles. Analysis of the association of Puroindoline-D1 alleles with grain texture indicated that wheat cultivars with Pina-null/Pinb-null allele, possessing an approximate 33-kb deletion in the Ha locus, have the highest SKCS hardness index amongst the different genotypes used in this study. Moreover, wheat cultivars with the PINA-null allele have significantly higher SKCS hardness index than those of Pinb-D1b and Pinb-D1p alleles.
   Conclusions: Molecular characterization of the Puroindoline-D1 allele was investigated in bread wheat cultivars from five geographic regions, resulting in the discovery of two new alleles - Pina-D1s and Pina-D1u. Molecular markers were developed for both alleles. Analysis of the association of the Puroindoline-D1 alleles with grain texture showed that cultivars with PINA-null allele possessed relatively high SKCS hardness index. This study can provide useful information for the improvement of wheat quality, as well as give a deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic processes controlling grain texture in bread wheat.

AB Background: Several studies report about intra-specific trait variation of nitrogen-metabolism related traits, such as N(itrogen)-use efficiency, protein content, N-storage and remobilization in barley and related grass species. The goal of this study was to assess the intra-specific genetic diversity present in primary N-metabolism genes of barley and to investigate the associations of the detected haplotype diversity with malting and kernel quality related traits.
   Results: Partial sequences of five genes related to N-metabolism in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were obtained, i.e. nitrate reductase 1, glutamine synthetase 2, ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, aspartate aminotransferase and asparaginase. Two to five haplotypes in each gene were discovered in a set of 190 various varieties. The development of 33 SNP markers allowed the genotyping of all these barley varieties consisting of spring and winter types. Furthermore, these markers could be mapped in several doubled haploid populations. Cluster analysis based on haplotypes revealed a more uniform pattern of the spring barleys as compared to the winter barleys. Based on linear model approaches associations to several malting and kernel quality traits including soluble N and protein were identified.
   Conclusions: A study was conducted to investigate the presence of sequence variation of several genes related to the primary N-metabolism in barley. The detected diversity could be related to particular phenotypic traits. Specific differences between spring and winter barleys most likely reflect different breeding aims. The developed markers can be used as tool for further genetic studies and marker-assisted selection during breeding of barley.

AB The wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pm40, which is located on chromosomal arm 7BS, is effective against nearly all prevalent races of Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) in China and is carried by the common wheat germplasm PI 672538. A set of the F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations from the cross of the resistant PI 672538 with the susceptible line L1034 were used to conduct genetic analysis of powdery mildew resistance and construct a high-density linkage map of the Pm40 gene. We constructed a high-density linkage genetic map with a total length of 6.18 cM and average spacing between markers of 0.48 cM. Pm40 is flanked by Xwmc335 and BF291338 at genetic distances of 0.58 cM and 0.26 cM, respectively, in deletion bin C-7BS-1-0.27. Comparative genomic analysis based on EST-STS markers established a high level of collinearity of the Pm40 genomic region with a 1.09-Mbp genomic region on Brachypodium chromosome 3, a 1.16-Mbp genomic region on rice chromosome 8, and a 1.62-Mbp genomic region on sorghum chromosome 7. We further anchored the Pm40 target intervals to the wheat genome sequence. A putative linear index of 85 wheat contigs containing 97 genes on 7BS was constructed. In total, 9 genes could be considered as candidates for the resistances to powdery mildew in the target genomic regions, which encoded proteins that were involved in the plant defense and response to pathogen attack. These results will facilitate the development of new markers for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection of Pm40 in wheat breeding programs.

AB An indirect phenotyping method was developed in order to estimate the susceptibility of rubber tree clonal varieties to Corynespora Leaf Fall (CLF) disease caused by the ascomycete Corynespora cassiicola. This method consists in quantifying the impact of fungal exudates on detached leaves by measuring the induced electrolyte leakage (EL%). The tested exudates were either crude culture filtrates from diverse C. cassiicola isolates or the purified cassiicolin (Cas1), a small secreted effector protein produced by the aggressive isolate CCP. The test was found to be quantitative, with the EL% response proportional to toxin concentration. For eight clones tested with two aggressive isolates, the EL% response to the filtrates positively correlated to the response induced by conidial inoculation. The toxicity test applied to 18 clones using 13 toxinic treatments evidenced an important variability among clones and treatments, with a significant additional clone x treatment interaction effect. A genetic linkage map was built using 306 microsatellite markers, from the F1 population of the PB260 x RRIM600 family. Phenotyping of the population for sensitivity to the purified Cas1 effector and to culture filtrates from seven C. cassiicola isolates revealed a polygenic determinism, with six QTL detected on five chromosomes and percentages of explained phenotypic variance varying from 11 to 17%. Two common QTL were identified for the CCP filtrate and the purified cassiicolin, suggesting that Cas1 may be the main effector of CCP filtrate toxicity. The CCP filtrate clearly contrasted with all other filtrates. The toxicity test based on Electrolyte Leakage Measurement offers the opportunity to assess the sensitivity of rubber genotypes to C. cassiicola exudates or purified effectors for genetic investigations and early selection, without risk of spreading the fungus in plantations. However, the power of this test for predicting field susceptibility of rubber clones to CLF will have to be further investigated.

AB Background: Gossypium anomalum (BB genome) possesses the desirable characteristics of drought tolerance, resistance to diseases and insect pests, and the potential for high quality fibers. However, it is difficult to transfer the genes associated with these desirable traits into cultivated cotton (G. hirsutum, AADD genome). Monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) can be used as a bridge to transfer desired genes from wild species into G. hirsutum. In cotton, however, the high number and smaller size of the chromosomes has resulted in difficulties in discriminating chromosomes from wild species in cultivated cotton background, the development of cotton MAALs has lagged far behind many other crops. To date, no set of G. hirsutum-G. anomalum MAALs was reported. Here the amphiploid (AADDBB genome) derived from G. hirsutumx G. anomalum was used to generate a set of G. hirsutum-G. anomalum MAALs through a combination of consecutive backcrossing, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), morphological survey and microsatellite marker identification.
   Results: We improved the GISH technique used in our previous research by using a mixture of two probes from G. anomalum and G. herbaceum (AA genome). The results indicate that a ratio of 4: 3 (G. anomalum : G. herbaceum) is the most suitable for discrimination of chromosomes from G. anomalum and the At-subgenome of G. hirsutum. Using this improved GISH technique, 108 MAAL individuals were isolated. Next, 170 G. hirsutum-and G. anomalum-specific codominant markers were obtained and employed for characterization of these MAAL individuals. Finally, eleven out of 13 MAALs were identified. Unfortunately, we were unable to isolate Chrs. 1B(a) and 5B(a) due to their very low incidences in backcrossing generation, as these remained in a condition of multiple additions.
   Conclusions: The characterized lines can be employed as bridges for the transfer of desired genes from G. anomalum into G. hirsutum, as well as for gene assignment, isolation of chromosome-specific probes, development of chromosome-specific "paints" for fluorochrome-labeled DNA fragments, physical mapping, and selective isolation and mapping of cDNAs/genes for a particular G. anomalum chromosome.

AB A pair of stripe rust and leaf rust resistance genes was introgressed from Aegilops caudata, a nonprogenitor diploid species with the CC genome, to cultivated wheat. Inheritance and genetic mapping of stripe rust resistance gene in backcross-recombinant inbred line (BC-RIL) population derived from the cross of a wheat-Ae. caudata introgression line (IL) T291-2(pau16060) with wheat cv. PBW343 is reported here. Segregation of BC-RILs for stripe rust resistance depicted a single major gene conditioning adult plant resistance (APR) with stripe rust reaction varying from TR-20MS in resistant RILs signifying the presence of some minor genes as well. Genetic association with leaf rust resistance revealed that two genes are located at a recombination distance of 13%. IL T291-2 had earlier been reported to carry introgressions on wheat chromosomes 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D and 7D. Genetic mapping indicated the introgression of stripe rust resistance gene on wheat chromosome 5DS in the region carrying leaf rust resistance gene LrAc, but as an independent introgression. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers designed from the survey sequence data of 5DS enriched the target region harbouring stripe and leaf rust resistance genes. Stripe rust resistance locus, temporarily designated as YrAc, mapped at the distal most end of 5DS linked with a group of four colocated SSRs and two resistance gene analogue (RGA)-STS markers at a distance of 5.3 cM. LrAc mapped at a distance of 9.0 cM from the YrAc and at 2.8 cM from RGA-STS marker Ta5DS_2737450, YrAc and LrAc appear to be the candidate genes for marker-assisted enrichment of the wheat gene pool for rust resistance.

AB Drought limits wheat production in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. In order to search for candidate genes associated to the response to water deficit, we analyzed the gene expression profiles, under severe drought stress, in roots and leaves of the cultivar MGS1 Alianca, a well-adapted cultivar to the Cerrado. A set of 4,422 candidate genes was found in roots and leaves. The number of down-regulated transcripts in roots was higher than the up-regulated transcripts, while the opposite occurred in leaves. The number of common transcripts between the two tissues was 1,249, while 2,124 were specific to roots and 1,049 specific to leaves. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a 0.78 correlation with the expression data. The candidate genes were distributed across all chromosomes and component genomes, but a greater number was mapped on the B genome, particularly on chromosomes 3B, 5B and 2B. When considering both tissues, 116 different pathways were induced. One common pathway, among the top three activated pathways in both tissues, was starch and sucrose metabolism. These results pave the way for future marker development and selection of important genes and are useful for understanding the metabolic pathways involved in wheat drought response.

In the present study, we conducted phenotypic characterization and genetic mapping of the cucumber virescent leaf mutant 9110Gt conferred by the v-1 locus. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid content in 9110Gt was reduced by 44% and 21%, respectively, as compared with its wild type parental line 9110G. Electron microscopic investigation revealed fewer chloroplasts per cell and thylakoids per chloroplast in 9110Gt than in 9110G. Fine genetic mapping allowed for the assignment of the v-1 locus to a 50.4 kb genomic DNA region in chromosome 6 with two flanking markers that were 0.14 and 0.16 cM away from v-1, respectively. Multiple lines of evidence supported CsaCNGCs as the only candidate gene for the v-1 locus, which encoded a cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channel protein. A single nucleotide change in the promoter region of v-1 seemed to be associated with the virescent color change in 9110Gt. Real-time PCR revealed significantly lower expression of CsaCNGCs in the true leaves of 9110Gt than in 9110G. This was the first report that connected the CsaCNGCs gene to virescent leaf color change, which provided a useful tool to establish linkages among virescent leaf color change, chloroplast development, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and the functions of the CsaCNGCs gene.

AB The chloroplast photosystem of flag leaves contributes the largest proportion of photosynthates to grain in crops and consequently affects grain weight. The plant 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1 is involved in chlorophyll protection against chloroplast damage. In the present study, we cloned a Tabas1 gene in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), comprising seven exons and six introns with a complete sequence of 2847 bp and an open reading frame of 789 bp. The gene was located on chromosome 2B, and designated Tabas1-B1. A codominant gene-specific marker TaS1 was developed based on a 1-bp InDel (-/A) in the second intron of Tabas1-B1. Two alleles, Tabas1-B1a and Tabas1-B1b, at the Tabas1-B1 locus were identified by TaS1. Linkage and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping indicated that Tabas1-B1 was linked to Xcfa2278 (5.23 cM) and Xbarc167 (10.38 cM) on chromosome 2BL. A stable QTL co-segregating with Tabas1-B1 explained 9.0-19.2 % of phenotypic variations for chlorophyll content (ChlC) and 9.5-15.5 % for thousand-grain weight (TGW), respectively, across three environments. Association analysis further indicated a significant and positive effect of Tabas1-B1a on the ChlC of flag leaf post-anthesis and TGW in two populations across four environments. Geographic distribution analysis suggested a slightly higher frequency of Tabas1-B1a than Tabas1-B1b in the main wheat-growing regions of China. Selection of Tabas1-B1a may increase grain weight in wheat breeding.

AB Agropyron cristatum (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) is a wild relative of common wheat and confers several desirable agronomic traits to wheat, such as high grain number per spike and enhanced resistance to certain diseases. Development of wheat - A. cristatum 6P translocation lines facilitates its utilization in wheat improvement. In this study, 26 wheat - A. cristatum 6P translocation lines were characterized by in situ hybridization (ISH) and 6P-specific sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers. These translocation lines carried different 6P chromosomal segments, which covered the whole 6P chromosome. FISH results showed that 15, 5, and 6 lines were translocated onto wheat A, B, and D genomes, respectively. Compared with the previous reports, a fine physical map of 6P chromosome was constructed, consisting of 31 chromosomal bins with 255 STS markers. Twelve translocation lines containing 6PS13 similar to 14 chromosomal bins were highly resistant to leaf rust. Two lines showed high grain number per spike, and three lines displayed both enhanced grain number per spike and thousand-grain weight. Development of wheat - A. cristatum 6P translocation lines will not only provide novel wheat germplasm for wheat breeding but also be helpful to broaden the genetic basis of common wheat.

AB Hybrid necrosis has been observed in many interspecific hybrids from crosses between tetraploid wheat and the wheat D-genome donor Aegilops tauschii. Type II necrosis is a kind of hybrid incompatibility that is specifically characterized by low-temperature induction and growth suppression. Two complementary genes, Net1 on the AB genome and Net2 on the D genome, putatively control type II necrosis in ABD triploids and synthetic hexaploid wheat. Toward map-based cloning of Net2, a fine map around the Net2 region on 2DS was constructed in this study. Using the draft genome sequence of Ae. tauschii and the physical map of the barley genome, the Net2 locus was mapped within a 0.6 cM interval between two closely linked markers. Although local chromosomal rearrangements were observed in the Net2-corresponding region between the barley/Brachypodium and Ae. tauschii genomes, the two closely linked markers were significantly associated with type II necrosis in Ae. tauschii. These results suggest that these markers will aid efficient selection of Net2 non-carrier individuals from the Ae. tauschii population and intraspecific progeny, and could help with introgression of agriculturally important genes from Ae. tauschii to common wheat.

AB Allocation of the chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii in triticale background resulted in changes of its organization, what is related to varied expression of genes determining agronomically important traits.
   Monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) are crucial for transfer of genes from wild relatives into cultivated varieties. This kind of genetic stocks is used for physical mapping of specific chromosomes and analyzing alien genes expression. The main aim of our study is to improve hexaploid triticale by transferring D-genome chromatin from Aegilops tauschii x Secale cereale (2n = 4x = 28, DDRR). In this paper, we demonstrate the molecular cytogenetics analysis and SSR markers screening combined with phenotype analysis and evaluation of powdery mildew infection of triticale monosomic addition lines carrying chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii. We confirmed the inheritance of chromosome 2D from the BC2F4 to the BC2F6 generation of triticale hybrids. Moreover, we unveiled a high variable region on the short arm of chromosome 2D, where chromosome rearrangements were mapped. These events had direct influence on plant height of hybrids what might be connected with changes at Rht8 loci. We obtained 20 semi-dwarf plants of BC2F6 generation carrying 2D chromosome with the powdery mildew resistance, without changes in spike morphology, which can be used in the triticale breeding programs.

AB In order to investigate the genetic diversity and genetic status of Secale cereale L. subsp. segetale Zhuk., a weedy rye found in China, gliadin spectra of 90 S. cereale subsp. segetale populations were analyzed using the A-PAGE. The results showed a total of 34 bands were detected in all populations with eight common bands, one common band in gamma-zone and seven common bands in omega-zone. The polymorphic bands taken on 76.5 %. All bands in alpha-, beta- zone were polymorphic. The number of bands in each population ranged from 11 to 23. Each population showed unique electrophoretic pattern. The average Shannon index to four electrophoretic zones was 1.455. The highest Shannon index was found for the population 90R17, and alpha-, beta-, gamma- and omega-zone's index detected 0.711, 1.156, 0.640 and 4.408 respectively. The lowest Shannon index was found for the population 89R55, and in alpha-, beta-, gamma- and omega-zone showed 0.000, 0.899, 0.322, and 2.709, respectively. The nearest genetic distance (0.027) was found between 90R16 and 90R35 (two Yining region's populations), and the farthest genetic distance (0.569) was observed between 90R39 and 90R24, 90R34 (all from different regions). At Nei's distance of 0.25, S. cereale subsp. segetale populations were clustered into five groups. AMOVA analysis indicated 14.0 % of the total genetic variation resided among populations, 86.0 % occurred within populations, and zero showed among regions. The abundant genetic diversity of implied elite genes that can be used in population diagnostics.

AB Triticum timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28, GGA(t)A(t)) is a tetraploid wheat formerly cultivated in western Georgia. The natural allopolyploid Triticum zhukovskyi is a hexaploid taxon originated from hybridization of T. timopheevii with cultivated einkorn T. monococcum (2n = 2x = 14, A(m)A(m)). Karyotypically T. timopheevii and T. zhukovskyi differ from other tetraploid and hexaploid wheats and were assigned to the section Timopheevii of the genus Triticum L. Triticum timopheevii and T. zhukovskyi are resistant to many fungal diseases and therefore could potentially be utilized for wheat improvement. We were aiming to precisely identify all T. timopheevii chromosomes and to trace the evolution of T. zhukovskyi. For this, we developed a set of molecular cytogenetic landmarks based on eleven DNA probes. Each chromosome can now be characterized by two to eight probes. The pTa-535 sequence allows the identification of all A(t)-genome chromosomes, whereas G-genome and some A(t)-genome chromosomes can be identified using (GAA/CTT) (n) and pSc119.2 probes. The probes pAesp_SAT86, pAs1, Spelt-1, Spelt-52 and 5S and 45S rDNA can be applied as additional markers to discriminate particular chromosomes or chromosomal regions. The distribution of (GAA/CTT) (n) , pTa-535 and pSc119.2 DNA probes on T. timopheevii chromosomes is distinct from other tetraploid wheats and can therefore be used to track individual chromosomes in introgression programs. Our study confirms the origin of T. zhukovskyi from hybridization of T. timopheevii with T. monococcum; however, we show that the emergence was accompanied by changes involving mostly A(t)-genome chromosomes. This may be due to the presence of two closely related A-genomes in the T. zhukovskyi karyotype.

AB We developed and validated a robust marker toolkit for high-throughput and cost-effective screening of a large number of functional genes in wheat.
   Functional markers (FMs) are the most valuable markers for crop breeding programs, and high-throughput genotyping for FMs could provide an excellent opportunity to effectively practice marker-assisted selection while breeding cultivars. Here we developed and validated kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays for genes that underpin economically important traits in bread wheat including adaptability, grain yield, quality, and biotic and abiotic stress resistances. In total, 70 KASP assays either developed in this study or obtained from public databases were validated for reliability in application. The validation of KASP assays were conducted by (a) comparing the assays with available gel-based PCR markers on 23 diverse wheat accessions, (b) validation of the derived allelic information using phenotypes of a panel comprised of 300 diverse cultivars from China and 13 other countries, and (c) additional testing, where possible, of the assays in four segregating populations. All KASP assays being reported were significantly associated with the relevant phenotypes in the cultivars panel and bi-parental populations, thus revealing potential application in wheat breeding programs. The results revealed 45 times superiority of the KASP assays in speed than gel-based PCR markers. KASP has recently emerged as single-plex high-throughput genotyping technology; this is the first report on high-throughput screening of a large number of functional genes in a major crop. Such assays could greatly accelerate the characterization of crossing parents and advanced lines for marker-assisted selection and can complement the inflexible, high-density SNP arrays. Our results offer a robust and reliable molecular marker toolkit that can contribute towards maximizing genetic gains in wheat breeding programs.

AB Powdery mildew resistance gene Pm55 was physically mapped to chromosome arm 5VS FL 0.60-0.80 of Dasypyrum villosum . Pm55 is present in T5VS center dot 5AL and T5VS center dot 5DL translocations, which should be valuable resources for wheat improvement.
   Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is a major wheat disease worldwide. Exploiting novel genes effective against powdery mildew from wild relatives of wheat is a promising strategy for controlling this disease. To identify novel resistance genes for powdery mildew from Dasypyrum villosum, a wild wheat relative, we evaluated a set of Chinese Spring-D. villosum disomic addition and whole-arm translocation lines for reactions to powdery mildew. Based on the evaluation data, we concluded that the D. villosum chromosome 5V controls post-seedling resistance to powdery mildew. Subsequently, three introgression lines were developed and confirmed by molecular and cytogenetic analysis following ionizing radiation of the pollen of a Chinese Spring-D. villosum 5V disomic addition line. A homozygous T5VS center dot 5AL translocation line (NAU421) with good plant vigor and full fertility was further characterized using sequential genomic in situ hybridization, C-banding, and EST-STS marker analysis. A dominant gene permanently named Pm55 was located in chromosome bin 5VS 0.60-0.80 based on the responses to powdery mildew of all wheat-D. villosum 5V introgression lines evaluated at both seeding and adult stages. This study demonstrated that Pm55 conferred growth-stage and tissue-specific dependent resistance; therefore, it provides a novel resistance type for powdery mildew. The T5VS center dot 5AL translocation line with additional softness loci Dina/Dinb of D. villosum provides a possibility of extending the range of grain textures to a super-soft category. Accordingly, this stock is a new source of resistance to powdery mildew and may be useful in both resistance mechanism studies and soft wheat improvement.

AB Parastagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing Septoria nodorum blotch on wheat. We have identified nine necrotrophic effector host dominant sensitivity gene interactions, and we have cloned three of the necrotrophic effector genes, including SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3. Because sexual populations of P. nodorum are difficult to develop under lab conditions, genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the best population genomic approach to identify genomic regions associated with traits using natural populations. In this article, we used a global collection of 191 P. nodorum isolates from which we identified 2,983 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and gene markers for SnToxA and SnTox3 to evaluate the power of GWAS on two popular wheat breeding lines that were sensitive to SnToxA and SnTox3. Strong marker trait associations (MTA) with P. nodorum virulence that mapped to SnTox3 and SnToxA were first identified using the marker set described above. A novel locus in the P. nodorum genome associated with virulence was also identified as a result of this analysis. To evaluate whether a sufficient level of marker saturation was available, we designed a set of primers every 1 kb in the genomic regions containing SnToxA and SnTox3. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed across the 191 isolates and the presence/absence polymorphism was scored and used as the genotype. The marker proximity necessary to identify MTA flanking SnToxA and SnTox3 ranged from 4 to 5 and 1 to 7 kb, respectively. Similar analysis was performed on the novel locus. Using a 45% missing data threshold, two more SNP were identified spanning a 4.6-kb genomic region at the novel locus. These results showed that the rate of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay in P. nodorum and, likely, other fungi is high compared with plants and animals. The fast LD decay in P. nodorum is an advantage only if sufficient marker density is attained. Based on our results with the SnToxA and SnTox3 regions, markers are needed every 9 or 8 kb, respectively, or in every gene, to guarantee that genes associated with a quantitative trait such as virulence are not missed.

AB Tyee, one of the wheat cultivars used to differentiate races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici in the United States, was identified to have a single gene for all-stage resistance, tentatively named YrTye. To map the gene, Tyee was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AvS). Genetic analysis of the F-1, F-2, F-2:3, and BC1 progenies confirmed a single dominant gene for resistance to race PSTv-37 that is avirulent to YrTye. A mapping population of 135 F-2 plants was phenotyped with PSTv-37 and the derived F-2:3 lines were tested with races PSTv-37, PSTv-40, and PSTv-79. The F-2 mapping population was genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A genetic map comprising 13 SSR markers located YrTye in chromosome 3AS flanked distally by SSR marker wmc11 and proximally by wmc532 at 2.6 and 3.4 cM, respectively. Amplification of Chinese Spring 3A deletion lines placed the gene in the distal bin 3AS4-0.45 to 1.00. Because YrTye is different from all formally named Yr genes in chromosomal location, we permanently name the gene Yr76. A near-isogenic line of spring common wheat was developed and selected by testing F-3 lines derived from a AvS*4/Tyee cross with Tyee-avirulent and virulent races and the flanking markers. The specific SSR alleles flanking Yr76 were validated using cultivars and breeding lines with and without the gene, and showed high polymorphisms. The specificity of Yr76 is useful in differentiating P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races, and its tightly linked markers will be useful in developing resistant cultivars when combining the gene with other genes for resistance to stripe rust.

AB This study explored 6P chromosomal translocations in wheat, and determined the effects of 6P intercalary chromosome segments on kernel number per wheat spike.
   Exploiting and utilising gene(s) from wild relative species has become an essential strategy for wheat crop improvement. In the translocation line Pubing2978, the intercalary 6P chromosome segment from Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) carried valuable multi-kernel gene(s) and was selected from the offspring of the common wheat plant Fukuho and the irradiated wheat-A. cristatum 6P disomic substitution line 4844-8. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH), dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), and molecular markers were used to detect the small segmental 6P chromosome in the wheat background and its translocation breakpoint. Cytological studies demonstrated that Pubing2978 was a T1AS-6PL-1AS center dot 1AL intercalary translocation with 42 chromosomes. The breakpoint was located near the centromeric region on the wheat chromosome 1AS and was flanked by the markers SSR12 and SSR283 based on an F-2 linkage map. The genotypic data, combined with the phenotypic information, implied that A. cristatum 6P chromosomal segment plays an important role in regulating the kernel number per spike (KPS). By comparison, the mean value of KPS in plants with translocations was approximately 10 higher than that in plants without translocations in three segregated populations. Moreover, the improvement in KPS was likely achieved by increasing both the spikelet number per spike (SNS) and the kernel number per spikelet. These excellent agronomic traits laid the foundation for further investigation of valuable genes and make the Pubing2978 line a promising germplasm for wheat breeding.

AB A total of 108 isolates of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici were collected from four distinct locations of Tunisia and characterized for three mitochondrial DNA sequences to provide insight into the genetic diversity and population structure of the fungus in this country. The number of different alleles averaged over all loci within locations ranged from 3.33 to 5.67, with an average of 4.42 per location. Multilocus analysis identified 27 (25 %) distinct haplotypes among the 108 assessed isolates, revealing a high mtDNA-based clonality within the population. Three of the highlighted haplotypes occurred in all locations and nine of them covered at least two locations. Significant levels of genetic diversity were found for the whole population and within each of the sampled locations, as indicated by the Nei's gene diversity (0.52), unbiased gene diversity (0.58) and allele richness (4.43) indices. Further analyzes using Bayesian and non-Bayesian statistical models, as well as AMOVA, showed a lack of mtDNA-based genetic structure (G(ST) = 0.06), hence supporting previous reports on Z. tritici in Tunisia performed using nuclear-DNA markers. A high level of gene flow (Nm = 8.27) corroborates the lack of structure and suggests regular cycles of sexual reproduction, leading to allelic pool homogenization via wind-born ascospores in the Tunisian population of Z. tritici.

AB Flowering time variation was identified within a mapping population of doubled haploid lines developed from a cross between the introgressive line 8.1 and spring bread wheat cv. Tahti. The line 8.1 carried introgressions from tetraploid Triticum militinae in the cv. Tahti genetic background on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 4A, 5A, 7A, 1B and 5B. The most significant QTL for the flowering time variation was identified within the introgressed region on chromosome 5A and its largest effect was associated with the VRN-A1 locus, accounting for up to 70% of phenotypic variance. The allele of T. militinae origin was designated as VRN-A1f-like. The effect of the VRN-A1f-like allele was verified in two other mapping populations. QTL analysis identified that in cv. Tahti and cv. Mooni genetic background, VRN-A1f-like allele incurred a delay of 1.9-18.6 days in flowering time, depending on growing conditions. Sequence comparison of the VRN-A1f-like and VRN-A1a alleles from the parental lines of the mapping populations revealed major mutations in the promoter region as well as in the first intron, including insertion of a MITE element and a large deletion. The sequence variation allowed construction of specific diagnostic PCR markers for VRN-A1f-like allele determination. Identification and quantification of the effect of the VRN-A1f-like allele offers a useful tool for wheat breeding and for studying fine-scale regulation of flowering pathways in wheat.

AB To introduce new genetic diversity into the bread wheat gene pool from its progenitor, Aegi-lops tauschii (Coss.) Schmalh, 33 primary synthetic hexaploid wheat genotypes (SYN) were crossed to 20 spring bread wheat (BW) cultivars at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center. Modified single seed descent was used to develop 97 populations with 50 individuals per population using first back-cross, biparental, and three-way crosses. Individuals from each cross were selected for short stature, early heading, flowering and maturity, minimal lodging, and free threshing. Yield trials were conducted under irrigated, drought, and heat-stress conditions from 2011 to 2014 in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of parents and synthetic derived lines (SDLs) were estimated using a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model with markers in each trial. In each environment, there were SDLs that had higher GEBVs than their recurrent BW parent for yield. The GEBVs of BW parents for yield ranged from -0.32 in heat to 1.40 in irrigated trials. The range of the SYN parent GEBVs for yield was from -2.69 in the irrigated to 0.26 in the heat trials and were mostly negative across environments. The contribution of the SYN parents to improved grain yield of the SDLs was highest under heat stress, with an average GEBV for the top 10% of the SDLs of 0.55 while the weighted average GEBV of their corresponding recurrent BW parents was 0.26. Using the pedigree-based model, the accuracy of genomic prediction for yield was 0.42, 0.43, and 0.49 in the drought, heat and irrigated trials, respectively, while for the marker-based model these values were 0.43, 0.44, and 0.55. The SYN parents introduced novel diversity into the wheat gene pool. Higher GEBVs of progenies were due to introgression and retention of some positive alleles from SYN parents.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important crop worldwide. The physiological deterioration of seeds during storage and seed priming is closely associated with germination, and thus contributes to plant growth and subsequent grain yields. In this study, wheat seeds during different stages of artificial ageing (45 degrees C; 50% relative humidity; 98%, 50%, 20%, and 1% Germination rates) and priming (hydro-priming treatment) were subjected to proteomics analysis through a proteomic approach based on the isobaric tandem mass tag labeling. A total of 162 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) mainly involved in metabolism, energy supply, and defense/stress responses, were identified during artificial ageing and thus validated previous physiological and biochemical studies. These DEPs indicated that the inability to protect against ageing leads to the incremental decomposition of the stored substance, impairment of metabolism and energy supply, and ultimately resulted in seed deterioration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the up-regulated proteins involved in seed ageing were mainly enriched in ribosome, whereas the down-regulated proteins were mainly accumulated in energy supply (starch and sucrose metabolism) and stress defense (ascorbate and aldarate metabolism). Proteins, including hemoglobin 1, oleosin, agglutinin, and non-specific lipid-transfer proteins, were first identified in aged seeds and might be regarded as new markers of seed deterioration. Of the identified proteins, 531 DEPs were recognized during seed priming compared with unprimed seeds. In contrast to the up-regulated DEPs in seed ageing, several up-regulated DEPs in priming were involved in energy supply (tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation), anabolism (amino acids, and fatty acid synthesis), and cell growth/division. KEGG and protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that the up-regulated proteins in seed priming were mainly enriched in amino acid synthesis, stress defense (plant-pathogen interactions, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism), and energy supply (oxidative phosphorylation and carbonmetabolism). Therefore, DEPs associated with seed ageing and priming can be used to characterize seed vigor and optimize germination enhancement treatments. This work reveals new proteomic insights into protein changes that occur during seed deterioration and priming.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) has a complex allohexaploid genome, which makes it difficult to differentiate between the homoeologous sequences and assign them to the chromosome A, B, or D subgenomes. The chromosome-based draft genome sequence of the 'Chinese Spring' common wheat cultivar enables the large-scale development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers specific for homoeologs. Based on high-confidence 'Chinese Spring' genes with known functions, we developed 183 putative homoeolog- specific markers for chromosomes 4B and 7B. These markers were used in PCR assays for the 4B and 7B nullisomes and their euploid synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) line that was newly generated from a hybridization between Triticum turgidum (AABB) and the wild diploid species Aegilops tauschii (DD). Up to 64% of the markers for chromosomes 4B or 7B in the SHW background were confirmedto be homoeolog-specific. Thus, these markers were highly transferable between the 'Chinese Spring' bread wheat and SHW lines. Homoeolog-specific markers designed using genes with known functions may be useful for genetic investigations involving homoeologous chromosome tracking and homoeolog expression and interaction analyses.

AB Background: The knowledge of the extent and pattern of diversity in the crop species is a prerequisite for any crop improvement as it helps breeders in deciding suitable breeding strategies for their future improvement. Rice is the main staple crop in India with the large number of varieties released every year. Studies based on the small set of rice genotypes have reported a loss in genetic diversity especially after green revolution. However, a detailed study of the trend of diversity in Indian rice varieties is lacking. SSR markers have proven to be a marker of choice for studying the genetic diversity. Therefore, the present study was undertaken with the aim to characterize and assess trends of genetic diversity in a large set of Indian rice varieties (released between 1940-2013), conserved in the National Gene Bank of India using SSR markers.
   Result: A set of 729 Indian rice varieties were genotyped using 36 HvSSR markers to assess the genetic diversity and genetic relationship. A total of 112 alleles was amplified with an average of 3.11 alleles per locus with mean Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) value of 0.29. Cluster analysis grouped these varieties into two clusters whereas the model based population structure divided them into three populations. AMOVA study based on hierarchical cluster and model based approach showed 3 % and 11 % variation between the populations, respectively. Decadal analysis for gene diversity and PIC showed increasing trend from 1940 to 2005, thereafter values for both the parameters showed decreasing trend between years 2006-2013. In contrast to this, allele number demonstrated increasing trend in these varieties released and notified between 1940 to 1985, it remained nearly constant during 1986 to 2005 and again showed an increasing trend.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the Indian rice varieties harbors huge amount of genetic diversity. However, the trait based improvement program in the last decades forced breeders to rely on few parents, which resulted in loss of gene diversity during 2006 to 2013. The present study indicates the need for broadening the genetic base of Indian rice varieties through the use of diverse parents in the current breeding program.

AB A Fragaria Discovery Panel (FDP; strawberry-specific SDA) containing 287 features was constructed by subtracting the pooled gDNA of nine non-angiosperm species from the pooled gDNA of five strawberry genotypes. This FDP was used for Bulk Segregant Analysis (BSA) to enable identification of molecular markers associated with day-neutrality. Analysis of hybridisation patterns of a short day (SD) DNA bulk and three day-neutral (DN) DNA bulks varying in flowering strength allowed identification of a novel feature, FaP2E11, closely linked to CYTOKININ OXIDASE 1 (CKX1) gene possibly involved in promoting flowering under non-inductive condition. The signal intensities of FaP2E11 feature obtained from the strong DN bulk (DN1) is three fold higher than the short day bulk (SD), indicating that the putative marker may linked to a CKX1 variant allele with lower enzyme activity. We propose a model for flowering regulation based on the hypothesis that flowering strength may be regulated by the copy number of FaP2E11-linked CKX1 alleles. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the SDA-based BSA approach for the identification of molecular markers associated with day-neutrality in strawberry. This innovative strategy is an efficient and cost-effective approach for molecular marker discovery.

AB Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28; genomes PPPP) is one of the wild species closely related to cultivated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which possesses a number of superior agronomic traits and thus represents a valuable resource for wheat improvement. Development of wheat-A. cristatum addition lines is usually considered to be the first step in transferring desirable alien genes into common wheat from A. cristatum. In this study, we report a novel wheat-A. cristatum 2P disomic addition line II-93, which contained 42 wheat chromosomes and a pair of A. cristatum chromosomes as revealed by genomic in situ hybridization. The homoeologous relationship between A. cristatum and wheat chromosomes was determined using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing markers specific to the A. cristatum 2P chromosome. Moreover, II-9-3 displayed high resistance to powdery mildew at both seedling and adult stages. Genetic analysis was conducted using an F-2 population made by crossing II-9-3 with the susceptible cultivar Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho), and the results indicated that powdery mildew resistance was attributable to A. cristatum 2P chromosome in II-9-3. Besides, the resistance spectrum of II-9-3 was quite broad, as it was found resistant to all the 17 Bgt isolates prevalent in northern China. Taken together, this study will provide applicable methods for both genetically characterizing wheat addition lines with alien chromosomes and also novel germplasm potentially valuable in wheat resistance breeding.

AB The use of analytical controls is essential when performing GMO detection through screening tests. Additionally, the presence of taxon-specific sequences is analyzed mostly for quality control during GMO detection. In this study, 11 commonly used genetic elements involving three promoters (P-35S, P-FMV35S and P-NOS), four marker genes (Bar, NPTII, HPT and Pmi), and four terminators (T-NOS, T-35S, T-g7 and T-e9), together with the reference gene fragments from six major crops of maize, soybean, rapeseed, rice, cotton and wheat, were co-integrated into the same single plasmid to construct a general reference plasmid pB1121-Screening. The suitability test of pBI121-Screening plasmid as reference material indicated that the non-target sequence on the pBI121-Screening plasmid did not affect the PCR amplification efficiencies of screening methods and taxon-specific methods. The sensitivity of screening and taxon-specific assays ranged from 5 to 10 copies of pBI121-Screening plasmid, meeting the sensitivity requirement of GMO detection. The construction of pBI121-Screening solves the lack of a general positive control for screening tests, thereby reducing the workload and cost of preparing a plurality of the positive control.

AB In this study, we designed and constructed a super twin T-DNA vector (pTRIDT313-g) containing two independent T-DNA cassettes one for the selection gene Hyg and the other for the target gene Gus-to produce marker free transgenic lines. The resulting vector was transformed into tobacco, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed four types of gene combinations in the T-1 and T-2 generations: Gus only, Hyg only, Gus + Hyg, and untransformed lines. The intermediate region from the T-DNA of the right border of Hyg to the left border of Gus in the Hyg and Gus lines was not amplified. Genome walking confirmed that the Hyg and Gus T-DNA cassettes were independently inserted in different regions of the tobacco genome. Thus, the two T-DNA cassettes were integrated randomly as independent loci into the tobacco genome. The results of reverse transcription-PCR indicated that Hyg could normally be expressed in the roots, stems, and leaves of transgenic lines, and the resistance test showed that all Hyg transgenic lines could grow in the presence of 50 mg/L hygromycin. All Gus transgenic lines showed obvious blue coloration in enzyme activity tests, indicating that the Gus gene could be normally expressed in all the lines. Therefore, the super twin T-DNA vector (pTRIDT313-g) exhibits independent integration, heredity, and normal gene function from two T-DNA cassettes. This vector could be a useful and valuable tool in the production of marker-free transgenic lines. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most destructive cereal diseases globally. Concern about the disease has increased since 1999 with the discovery in Uganda of a new virulent race of Pgt, designated as race TTKSK (also known as Ug99). The objectives of this experiment were to characterize the resistance and to determine the chromosomal location of the stem rust resistance in the spring wheat line PI 410966. A mapping population was developed from a cross between PI 410966 and a susceptible wheat line OK3040. An inoculation test with isolate 04KEN156/04 of race TTKSK was conducted at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory in the F-6:7 generation, and the F-6:7 phenotypic data were used to genetically map the resistance gene to the centromeric region on chromosome 2BS. The single locus explained the observed F-6:7 resistant and susceptible scores. The location of the gene and molecular marker banding profiles of the diagnostic markers suggest that the stem rust resistance gene in PI 410966 could be a new gene, an allele of Sr36, or Sr36.

AB Identification of alleles responsible for low molecular weight protein subunits (LMW-GS) is of immediate concern due to their large effect on wheat processing qualities, especially gluten elasticity. Allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) molecular markers have been developed to screen wheat genotypes for appropriate LMW-GS alleles. In this study sequence tagged site AS-PCR markers were used for identification of alleles at Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci for LMW protein subunits in twenty-six wheat cultivars developed in Pakistan to assess their potential contribution to enhance bread-making quality. Three alleles at Glu-A3 and four alleles at Glu-B3 loci were explored in the wheat genotypes under study. Allelic richness (4) and genetic diversity (H) (0.7) was comparatively higher for Glu-B3 locus as compared to Glu-A3 locus. Glu-A3b and Glu-A3d alleles were observed in 11 (64%) cultivars, which were known to encode high sedimentation and protein contents, which made them the important sources for wheat genetic improvement with special emphasis on quality of wheat.

AB Aegilops variabilis ((UUSSv)-S-v), an important sources for wheat improvement, originated from chromosome doubling of a natural hybrid between Ae. umbellulata (UU) with Ae. longissima ((SS1)-S-1). The Ae. variabilis karyotype was poorly characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The FISH probe combination of pSc119.2, pTa71 and pTa-713 identified each of the 14 pairs of Ae. variabilis chromosomes. Our FISH ideogram was further used to detect an Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying stripe rust resistance in the background of wheat lines developed from crosses of the stripe rust susceptible bread wheat cultivar Yiyuan 2 with a resistant Ae. variabilis accession. Among the 15 resistant BC1F7 lines, three were 2S(v) + 4S(v) addition lines (2n = 46) and 12 were 2S(v)(2B) or 2S(v)(2D) substitution lines that were confirmed with SSR markers. SSR marker gwm148 can be used to trace 2S(v) in common wheat background. Chromosome 2S(v) probably carries gametocidal(Gc) gene(s) since cytological instability and chromosome structural variations, including non homologous translocations, were observed in some lines with this chromosome. Due to the effects of photo period genes, substitution lines 2S(v)(2D) and 2S(v)(2B) exhibited late heading with 2S(v)(2D) lines being later than 2S(v)(2B) lines. 2S(v)(2D) substitution lines were also taller and exhibited higher spikelet numbers and longer spikes.

AB The plant-specific NAC transcription factors have attracted particular attention because of their involvement in stress responses, senescence, and nutrient remobilization. The HvNAC005 gene of barley encodes a protein belonging to subgroup NAC-a6 of the NAC family. This study shows that HvNAC005 is associated with developmental senescence. It was significantly up-regulated following ABA treatment, supported by ABA-responsive elements in its promoter, but it was not up-regulated during dark-induced senescence. The C-termini of proteins closely related to HvNAC005 showed overall high divergence but also contained conserved short motifs. A serine-and leucine-containing central motif was essential for transcriptional activity of the HvNAC005 C-terminus in yeast. Over-expression of HvNAC005 in barley resulted in a strong phenotype with delayed development combined with precocious senescence. The overexpressing plants showed up-regulation of genes involved with secondary metabolism, hormone metabolism, stress, signalling, development, and transport. Up-regulation of senescence markers and hormone metabolism and signalling genes supports a role of HvNAC005 in the cross field of different hormone and signalling pathways. Binding of HvNAC005 to promoter sequences of putative target genes containing the T[G/A] CGT core motif was shown by direct protein-DNA interactions of HvNAC005 with promoters for two of the up-regulated genes. In conclusion, HvNAC005 was shown to be a strong positive regulator of senescence and so is an obvious target for the fine-tuning of gene expression in future attempts to improve nutrient remobilization related to the senescence process in barley.

AB Fungal diseases are among the most devastating biotic stresses and often cause significant losses in wheat production worldwide. A set of 173 synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) characterized for resistance against fungal pathogens that cause leaf, stem and yellow rusts, yellow leaf spot, Septoria nodorum and crown rot were used in genome-wide association study (GWAS). Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and DArTSeq markers were employed for marker-trait association in which 74 markers associated with 35 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found to be significantly linked with disease resistances using a unified mixed model (P = 10(-3) to 10(-5)); Of these 15 QTL originated from D genome. Six markers on 1BL, 3BS, 4BL, 6B, and 6D conferred resistance to two diseases representing 10 of the 35 QTL. A further set of 147 SHW genotyped with DArT only markers validated 11 QTL detected in the previous 173 SHW. We also confirmed the presence of the gene Lr46/Yr29/Sr58/Pm39/Ltn2 on 1BL in the SHW germplasm. In addition, gene-gene interactions between significantly associated loci and all loci across the genome revealed five significant interactions at FDR <0.05. Two significant leaf rust and one stem rust interactions were thought to be synergistic, while another two QTL for yellow leaf spot involved antagonistic relations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GWAS for six fungal diseases using SHW. Identification of markers associated with disease resistance to one or more diseases represents an important resource for pyramiding favorable alleles and introducing multiple disease resistance from SHW accessions into current elite wheat cultivars.

AB Cereal cyst nematodes (CCN) are a global economic problem for cereal production. Heterodera filipjevi is one of the most commonly identified and widespread CCN species found in many wheat production regions of the world. Transferring novel genes for resistance to H. filipjevi from wild relatives of wheat is a promising strategy for protection of wheat crops. A set of wheat-Dasypyrum villosum chromosome addition lines, T6V#4S.6AL translocation lines and their donor parental lines were tested for their response to the nematode. D. villosum and wheat-D. villosum disomic addition line DA6V#4 were resistant. As T6V#4S.6AL translocation lines were susceptible, resistance was presumed to be located on chromosome 6V#4L. The objective of this study was to produce and characterize wheat-6V#4L translocations and confirm the chromosome location of the resistance. Introgression lines T6V#4L.6AS, T6V#4L-4BL.4BS and DT6V#4L were developed and subjected to molecular cytogenetic analysis. These and four additional wheat-6V#4 introgression lines were tested for response to H. filipjevi in the greenhouse. The results indicated that introgression lines DA6V#4, T6V#4L.6AS, T6V#4L-4BL.4BS, T6V#4L.6V#4S-7BS and DT6VL#4 had higher levels of H. filipjevi resistance than their recurrent parent. However, Del6V#4L-1 and translocation line T6V#4S.6AL were equally susceptible to wheat cv. Chinese Spring. The CCN resistance gene, temporarily named CreV, was therefore physically mapped to chromosome arm 6V#4L FL 0.80-1.00. Translocation chromosomes T6V#4L.6AS transferred to a modern wheat cv. Aikang 58 with its co-dominant molecular markers could be utilized as a novel germplasm for CCN resistance breeding in wheat.

AB Root system traits have positive effects on wheat grain yield, particularly in drought environments. Root traits are difficult to manipulate using conventional selection procedures. Marker-assisted-selection (MAS) could be helpful for the improvement of root morphological traits. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 168 lines derived from the cross Iran #49 x Yecora Rojo was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root traits at mid-tillering stage for one season and for root and shoot traits at plant maturity for two seasons using two different subsets. The RILs were grown in sand-tube experiments in a glasshouse under well-watered conditions. Longest root (LR), total root length longer 30 cm (TRL30), shallow root weight (roots between 0 and 30 cm, SRW), deep root weight (roots bellow 30 cm, DRW), total root biomass (RBio), ratio of root to shoot (RTS) and to plant (RTP) biomass were measured at mid-tillering. At maturity, number of days to booting (DTB), to heading (DTH), to anthesis (DTA), and to maturity (DTM), plant height (PH), flag leaf area (FLA), number of tillers (NTP) and spikes (NSP) per plant, number of grains (NGP), grain weight (GW), grain yield (GY) per plant, LR, SRW, DRW, RBio, PBio, and RTP were measured. At mid-tillering, a total of 18 putative QTLs were detected with individual QTL accounted for between 6.5 and 26.5 % of the variation in the traits. The QTLs were distributed on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2D, 4B, 6B, 7A, and 7D. A major and two minor QTLs were identified for LR, with the major QTL (qLR-2D) explaining 26.5 % of variation. Two QTLs were detected for DRW on chromosome 4B between markers Gwm6 and Sukkula.1220 that together explained 23.1 % of variation. One region between marker Wmc198 and Cfa2263 on chromosome 2A contained four QTLs affecting PH, SRW, RTS, and RTP. At maturity, 70 putative QTLs were detected across the two seasons with a single QTL accounted for between 7.7 and 40.6 % of variation in the traits. Three major colocalized QTLs for SRW, DRW, and RBio were identified on chromosome 2D between markers Wms515 and Wms102 that accounted for 19.8, 20.5, and 22.4 % 0f variation, respectively. Two major colocalized QTLs for SRW and RBio were detected on chromosome 3A that explained 17.8 and 13.4 % of variation, respectively. One major QTL for DRW was identified on chromosome 1B that accounted for 20.3 % of variation. Chromosome 2B harbored major QTLs for GY, NGS, and NGP. A major QTL cluster was detected on chromosome 2D and on chromosome 4A relating 11 and eight QTLs for phenological periods, root traits, RTS, and RTP, indicating pleiotropic effects on these traits. Of the four common root traits studied at mid-tillering and at maturity, only SRW had linked QTLs on chromosome 2A at both stages of plant growth, indicating selection for root traits at seedling stage alone may not be effective in changing root morphological characteristics at later stages of plant growth. It appeared that chromosome 2A, 2D, and 4B harbored genes regulating growth of root traits at early and later stages of plant growth. The molecular markers closely linked to QTLs for root and shoot traits may be used in wheat breeding program using MAS procedures.

AB Wheat yellow mosaic disease (WYM) became more serious in China in the recent years. Cultivation of resistant varieties is the major strategy for disease control. To identify WYM resistant genes in Chinese wheat cultivar 'Yining Xiaomai', a population of 106 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a cross between Yining Xiaomai and Zhen 9523 (WYM-susceptible) was generated. Phenotypic data of WYM resistance of the RILs were collected over three successive years in a naturally infected field nursery. A linkage map consisting of 29 genetic linkage groups involving 144 SSR or EST markers was constructed, using the JoinMap 4.0 software. By composite interval mapping using IciMapping 4.0, a stable major QTL associated with WYM resistance, designated QYm.nau-2D, was mapped to chromosome 2D which explained up to 93.2 % of the phenotypic variance. More linkage markers including 11 SNP and 11 STS markers were developed to saturate the QYm.nau-2D region. The presence of WYM resistance was further validated using a resistant RIL derived F-2 population consisting 318 lines. A high resolution map at QYm.nau-2D region was re-constructed which established a basis for map-based cloning of the resistant gene. Four markers were validated to be diagnostic markers to discriminate 195 breeding lines with known pedigree. These markers could be used in marker-assisted selection to breeding WYM resistance.

AB Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), a member of Bymovirus, is a plant pathogenic virus transmitted by the soil-borne plasmodiophorid Polymyxa graminis. The in planta titer of the virus must be quantified to elucidate the dynamics of WYMV infection and the mechanism(s) underlying host resistance. Here, we describe a robust and sensitive TaqMan-based real time PCR assay based on the sequence of the WYMV coat protein gene. WYMV was undetectable in either the leaves or roots of plants of WYMV-resistant cultivar Madsen grown in infected soil. However, when Madsen leaves were mechanically inoculated with the virus, viral multiplication was not inhibited, showing that the cultivar's resistance was ineffective in the leaf. The virus was able to move from the virus-inoculated leaf to the stem but not into the roots of Madsen, indicating that Madsen's resistance was effective only in the roots.

AB Main conclusion A novel broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene PmPB74 was identified in wheat-Agropyron cristatum introgression line Pubing 74.
   Development of wheat cultivars with broad-spectrum, durable resistance to powdery mildew has been restricted by lack of superior genetic resources. In this study, a wheat-A. cristatum introgression line Pubing 74, originally selected from a wide cross between the common wheat cultivar Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho) and Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn (2n = 4x = 28; genome PPPP), displayed resistance to powdery mildew at both the seedling and adult stages. The putative alien chromosomal fragment in Pubing 74 was below the detection limit of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), but evidence for other non-GISH-detectable introgressions was provided by the presence of three STS markers specific to A. cristatum. Genetic analysis indicated that Pubing 74 carried a single dominant gene for powdery mildew resistance, temporarily designated PmPB74. Molecular mapping showed that PmPB74 was located on wheat chromosome arm 5DS, and flanked by markers Xcfd81 and HRM02 at genetic distances of 2.5 and 1.7 cM, respectively. Compared with other lines with powdery mildew resistance gene(s) on wheat chromosome arm 5DS, Pubing 74 was resistant to all 28 Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) isolates from different wheat-producing regions of northern China. Allelism tests indicated that PmPB74 was not allelic to PmPB3558 or Pm2. Our work showed that PmPB74 is a novel gene with broad resistance to powdery mildew, and hence will be helpful in broadening the genetic basis of powdery mildew resistance in wheat.

AB Tinospora cordifolia is known for its medicinal properties owing to the presence of useful constituents such as terpenes, glycosides, steroids, alkaloids, and flavonoids belonging to secondary metabolism origin. However, there is little information available pertaining to critical genomic elements (ESTs, molecular markers) necessary for judicious exploitation of its germplasm. We employed 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing of entire transcripts and altogether similar to 25 K assembled transcripts or Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified. As the interest in T. cordifolia is primarily due to its secondary metabolite constituents, the ESTs pertaining to terpenoids biosynthetic pathway were identified in the present study. Additionally, several ESTs were assigned to different transcription factor families. To validate our transcripts dataset, the novel EST-SSR markers were generated to assess the genetic diversity among germplasm of T. cordifolia. These EST-SSR markers were found to be polymorphic and the dendrogram based on dice similarity index revealed three distinct clustering of accessions. The present study demonstrates effectiveness in using both NEWBLER and MIRA sequence read assembler software for enriching transcript-dataset and thus enables better exploitation of EST resources for mining candidate genes and designing molecular markers.

AB The Clearfield((R)) wheat cultivars possessing imidazolinone (IMI)-resistant traits provide an efficient option for controlling weeds. The imazamox-resistant cultivar Pantera (Clearfield((R))) was compared with a susceptible cultivar (Gazul). Target and non-target mechanisms of resistance were studied to characterize the resistance of Pantera and to identify the importance of each mechanism involved in this resistance. Pantera is resistant to imazamox as was determined in previous experiments. The molecular study confirmed that it carries a mutation Ser-Asn627 conferring resistance to imazamox in two out of three acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (imi1 and imi2), located in wheat on chromosomes 6B and 6D, respectively. However, the last gene (imi3) located on chromosome 6A does not carry any mutation conferring resistance. As a result, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content were reduced after imazamox treatment. Detoxification was higher in the resistant biotype as shown by metabolomic study while imazamox translocation was higher in the susceptible cultivar. Interestingly, imazamox metabolism was higher at higher doses of herbicide, which suggests that the detoxification process is an inducible mechanism in which the upregulation of key gene coding for detoxification enzymes could play an important role. Thus, the identification of cultivars with a higher detoxification potential would allow the development of more resistant varieties.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important diseases affecting wheat. In this study, seven gene-linked markers were used to identify the presence of stripe rust resistant genes in 51 accessions of synthetic hexaploid of wheat which were found to be resistant at seedling plant stage. Molecular marker-based gene identification showed the presence of Yr5, Yr10 and Yr15 in three accessions, Yr36 in three accessions, Yr48 in seven accessions, YrR61 in four accessions, and YrTP1 in ten accessions of resistant hexaploid of wheat. These gene-linked markers were also used for the detection of genetic diversity. A total of 68 alleles were detected by these seven gene-linked markers. The mean number of allele was 11.3 alleles per locus. Genetic diversity values ranged from 0.34 to 0.93, with highest genetic diversity value of 0.93 detected for marker Xwm477. The lowest genetic diversity value was observed for marker Xbarc167. The polymorphic information content value ranged from 0.33 to 0.92 with an average of 0.54. The highest number of alleles (n=24) were detected for marker Xwmc477. The evidence in this study on the basis of genetic diversity and presence of Yr genes in synthetic hexaploid wheat accessions will be useful in further breeding programmes.

AB A family of CBF transcription factors plays a major role in reconfiguring the plant transcriptome in response to low-freezing temperature in temperate cereals. In barley, more than 13 HvCBF genes map coincident with the major QTL FR-H2 suggesting them as candidates to explain the function of the locus. Variation in copy number (CNV) of specific HvCBFs was assayed in a panel of 41 barley genotypes using RT-qPCR. Taking advantage of an accurate phenotyping that combined F-v/F-m and field survival, resistance-associated variants within FR-H2 were identified. Genotypes with an increased copy number of HvCBF4 and HvCBF2 (at least ten and eight copies, respectively) showed greater frost resistance. A CAPS marker able to distinguish the CBF2A, CBF2B and CBF2A/B forms was developed and showed that all the higher-ranking genotypes in term of resistance harbour only CBF2A, while other resistant winter genotypes harbour also CBF2B, although at a lower CNV. In addition to the major involvement of the HvCBF4-HvCBF2 genomic segment in the proximal cluster of CBF elements, a negative role of HvCBF3 in the distal cluster was identified. Multiple linear regression models taking into account allelic variation at FR-H1/VRN-H1 explained 0.434 and 0.550 (both at p < 0.001) of the phenotypic variation for F-v/F-m and field survival respectively, while no interaction effect between CNV at the HvCBFs and FR-H1/VRN-H1 was found. Altogether our data suggest a major involvement of the CBF genes located in the proximal cluster, with no apparent involvement of the central cluster contrary to what was reported for wheat.

AB The aim of this work was to develop a method for the identification of pathogens causing rust diseases of crops using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of intact cells or spores (IC/IS). All optimizations were performed with Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of wheat leaf rust. Experiments included selection of washing solvents for spores, finding of an optimal concentration of spores in suspension and the most suitable matrix system as well as an evaluation of different sample preparation techniques. The best results were obtained when the spores were washed with acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 7:3, v/v. A mixture of ferulic and sinapinic acids (5:15 mg ml(-1)) dissolved in acetonitrile/2.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 7:3, v/v, was found optimal for the deposition of samples (50 mu g spores per mu l) by two layer volume technique. The optimized protocol was subsequently applied to other Puccinia species (Puccinia graminis, Puccinia striiformis and Puccinia coronata). Together with the use of the software BIOSPEAN, not only different species but also various pathotypes of the same species, which differ in their virulence, could be discriminated. There were 108 and 29 proteins identified from P. striiformis and P. graminis spores, respectively, after an acidic extraction in the matrix solvent mimicking the sample preparation for MALDI. Besides the presence of ribosomal proteins, histones, regulatory proteins and enzymes, also extracellular proteins participating in the pathogenesis were found. Finally, for both species, several proteins were assigned to signals in typical mass spectrometric profiles and suggested as diagnostic markers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yellow or stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating foliar disease that affects common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) around the world. In China, common wheat landraces are potential sources of disease and abiotic stress resistance genes for wheat improvement. Yilongtuomai (YL), a wheat landrace from Yilong County, Sichuan Province, shows high levels of resistance against most Chinese Pst races. In this study, the resistance of YL to stripe rust disease was examined in detail. Parent strains, YL and Taichung 29, a variety susceptible to Pst race CYR32, and their F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 offspring, were inoculated with CYR32 during the seedling stage in the field or adult-plant stage in the greenhouse. Results indicated that resistance to CYR32 in YL is conferred by a single dominant gene, designated YrYL. The segregating F-2 population (352 plants), was analyzed in terms of its resistance locus using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), resistance gene analog polymorphisms (RGAPs), and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP). A linkage group of 6 SSRs, 2 RGAPs, and 1 SRAP was constructed for the YrYL gene. Using the identified SSRs associated with physical mapping of RGAP using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic stocks, the YrYL gene was localized to the short arm of chromosome 7D. The gene was flanked by 1 SSR marker, Xbarc92, and 1 RGAP marker, CLRRfor/Ptokin4, at genetic distances of 5.35 and 9.86 cM, respectively. The YrYL gene was compared to other stripe rust resistance genes reported on chromosome 7D by evaluating its reaction patterns to CYR32 and its pedigree relationship. Our results suggest that the YrYL gene is a new stripe rust resistance gene.

AB Broad phenotypic variations were obtained previously in derivatives from the asymmetric somatic hybridization of cauliflower "Korso" (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis, 2n = 18, CC genome) and black mustard "G1/1" (Brassica nigra, 2n = 16, BB genome). However, the mechanisms underlying these variations were unknown. In this study, 28 putative introgression lines (ILs) were pre-selected according to a series of morphological (leaf shape and color, plant height and branching, curd features, and flower traits) and physiological (black rot/club root resistance) characters. Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that these plants contained 18 chromosomes derived from "Korso." Molecular marker (65 simple sequence repeats and 77 amplified fragment length polymorphisms) analysis identified the presence of "G1/1" DNA segments (average 7.5%). Additionally, DNA profiling revealed many genetic and epigenetic differences among the ILs, including sequence alterations, deletions, and variation in patterns of cytosine methylation. The frequency of fragments lost (5.1%) was higher than presence of novel bands (1.4%), and the presence of fragments specific to Brassica carinata (BBCC 2n = 34) were common (average 15.5%). Methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis indicated that methylation changes were common and that hypermethylation (12.4%) was more frequent than hypomethylation (4.8%). Our results suggested that asymmetric somatic hybridization and alien DNA introgression induced genetic and epigenetic alterations. Thus, these ILs represent an important, novel germplasm resource for cauliflower improvement that can be mined for diverse traits of interest to breeders and researchers.

AB Heat stress is one of the major problems in agriculturally important cereal crops, especially wheat. Here, we have constructed a subtracted cDNA library from the endosperm of HS treated (42 degrees C for 2 h) wheat cv. HD2985 by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). We identified similar to 550 recombinant clones ranging from 200 to 500 bp with an average size of 300 bp. Sanger's sequencing was performed with 205 positive clones to generate the differentially expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Most of the ESTs were observed to be localized on the long arm of chromosome 2A and associated with heat stress tolerance and metabolic pathways. Identified ESTs were BLAST search using Ensemble, TriFLD, and TIGR databases and the predicted CDS were translated and aligned with the protein sequences available in pfam and InterProScan 5 databases to predict the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). We observed eight different types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the DEPs corresponds to the cloned ESTs-147 sites with phosphorylation, 21 sites with sumoylation, 237 with palmitoylation, 96 sites with S-nitrosylation, 3066 calpain cleavage sites, and 103 tyrosine nitration sites, predicted to sense the heat stress and regulate the expression of stress genes. Twelve DEPs were observed to have transmembrane helixes (TMH) in their structure, predicted to play the role of sensors of HS. Quantitative Real-Time PCR of randomly selected ESTs showed very high relative expression of HSP17 under HS: up-regulation was observed more in wheat cv. HD2985 (thermotolerant), as compared to HD2329 (thermosusceptible) during grain-filling. The abundance of transcripts was further validated through northern blot analysis. The ESTs and their corresponding DEPs can be used as molecular marker for screening or targeted precision breeding program. PTMs identified in the DEPs can be used to elucidate the thermotolerance mechanism of wheat-a novel step toward the development of "climate-smart" wheat.

AB AP2/EREBPs play significant roles in plant growth and development. A novel, pleiotropic TaPARG (PLANT ARCHITECTURE-RELATED GENE), a member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor gene family, and its flanking sequences were isolated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two TaPARG genes were identified and named as TaPARG-2A and TaPARG-2D. Their amino acid sequences were highly similar especially in the functional domains. TaPARG-2A on chromosome 2A was flanked by markers Xwmc63 and Xgwm372. TaPARG-2D was mapped to chromosome 2D. Subcellular localization revealed that TaPARG-2D was localized in the nucleus. The results of tissue expression pattern, overexpression in rice, association analysis and distinct population verification jointly revealed that TaPARG functions during the entire growth cycle of wheat. Its functions include regulation of plant architecture related and yield-related traits. Association analysis, geographic distribution and allelic frequencies suggested that favored haplotypes Hap-2A-2 and Hap-2A-3 were selected in Chinese wheat breeding programs. Both favored haplotypes might be caused by a single amino acid substitution (His/Tyr). These results suggest that TaPARG is a regulatory factor in plant growth and development, and that the favored alleles might be useful for improving plant architecture and grain yield of wheat.

AB Previously we extended the utility of mapping-by-sequencing by combining it with sequence capture and mapping sequence data to pseudo-chromosomes that were organized using wheat-Brachypodium synteny. This, with a bespoke haplotyping algorithm, enabled us to map the flowering time locus in the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L. identifying a set of deleted genes (Gardiner et al., 2014). Here, we develop this combination of gene enrichment and sliding window mapping-by-synteny analysis to map the Yr6 locus for yellow stripe rust resistance in hexaploid wheat. A 110 MB NimbleGen capture probe set was used to enrich and sequence a doubled haploid mapping population of hexaploid wheat derived from an Avalon and Cadenza cross. The Yr6 locus was identified by mapping to the POPSEQ chromosomal pseudomolecules using a bespoke pipeline and algorithm (Chapman et al., 2015). Furthermore the same locus was identified using newly developed pseudo-chromosome sequences as a mapping reference that are based on the genic sequence used for sequence enrichment. The pseudo-chromosomes allow us to demonstrate the application of mapping-by-sequencing to even poorly defined polyploidy genomes where chromosomes are incomplete and sub-genome assemblies are collapsed. This analysis uniquely enabled us to: compare wheat genome annotations; identify the Yr6 locus -defining a smaller genic region than was previously possible; associate the interval with one wheat sub-genome and increase the density of SNP markers associated. Finally, we built the pipeline in iPlant, making it a user-friendly community resource for phenotype mapping.

AB In winter wheat in the USA, Aegilops cylindrica is one of the most troublesome weeds, while the pathogen Oculimacula spp. causes foot rot disease. Imazamox-resistant (IR) and foot rot-resistant (FR) wheat cultivars represent effective tools to control the weed and prevent disease infection. However, resistance allele (RA) movement between wheat and A. cylindrica facilitates the introgression process under herbicide and disease selection pressure. Field experiments using IR and FR A. cylindrica plants intermixed with susceptible plants were conducted to measure the proportion of the RAs in the progeny and RA movement with and without herbicide and disease selection. Yield components of A. cylindrica plants were determined across treatments. The herbicide RA proportion in the progeny was greater when plants were treated with the herbicide imazamox in both years. Disease RA proportion was greater with disease occurrence only in one year. Herbicide RA movement from resistant to susceptible plants was greater with herbicide than without it only in one year. Plants carrying the RAs had greater total spikelet weight and 1000-spikelet weight compared with susceptible plants with or without selection. However, susceptible plants produced more spikelets than the resistant ones in the absence of selection. If plants within an A. cylindrica population acquire the herbicide RA, its proportion will increase each generation under selection. These findings contribute to the understanding of crop allele introgression into related species and the evolution of increased weediness, with weed management implications.

AB The population genetic structure of plant pathogenic fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis was examined using microsatellite (SSR) markers. According to the geographical origin of the pathogen populations, they were designated as North Caucasian (S, 33 isolates), northwest (Nw, 39), and Omsk (Om, 43). The populations were analyzed at the nine most polymorphic SSR loci, at which 75 alleles were identified. To characterize the genetic variation within and between populations, the AMOVA algorithm as implemented in the Arlequin v. 3.5 software program was used. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 12 and their sizes varied within the range from 180 to 400 bp. The mean gene diversity at SSR loci was high for all populations (H = 0.58-0.75). The populations were considerably different in the frequencies of individual alleles of the SSR loci. Most isolates in the populations were represented by unique haplotypes. The within-population variation of the isolates at molecular markers was 86.4%; among the populations, 13.6%. Substantial interpopulation differences were found between the Om and S (F (st) = 0.16) and between the Om and Nw (F (st) = 0.20) populations, whereas between the S and Nw populations, these differences were small (F (st) = 0.05). Thus, it was demonstrated that the population of P. tritici-repentis from Omsk oblast had the independent status of the geographical population; northwest and North Caucasian populations differed in the allelic diversity of SSR loci, and despite the low F (st) value (0.05), they also belonged to independent geographical populations.

AB Two maize populations (GE440 x Sd7 and NC300 x Gm1002) were used in this study. Molecular markers like simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) were used to identify resistance genes linked to Fusarium ear rot (Fusariumverticillioides). Also, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was used to detect resistance genes on maize chromosomes. The co-dominant microsatellite markers (bnlg1063, umc2082, bnlg1621, umc2013, bnlg1740, umc2059 and SSR85) and STS (STS06) were amplified polymorphic bands and candidate markers linked to Fusarium ear rot resistance genes in maize. Seven QTLs were identified ranging from 2 to 7 for each trait. QTLs were distributed on two chromosomes and associated with grain yield/main ear and 100 kernel weight. The present study indicated that microsatellite and STS primers might be useful for developing improved cultivars.

AB The cereal cyst nematodes, Heterodera avenae group, are known as parasites of cereals worldwide. In Turkey, the cereal cyst nematodes, Heterodera filipjevi, H. avenae and H. latipons, are the three known species infested wheat fields and cause high yield losses. The using of resistance varieties is one of the most effective methods for controlling cereal cyst nematodes. Recently, resistance genes (Cre genes) which are obtained from wild wheat genotypes have been transferred into bread wheat varieties to control the cereal cyst nematodes species. In this study, the efficiency of some sources of resistance (CreR, Cre1, Cre2, Cre3, Cre7 and Cre8) in wheat against some Turkish H. avenae, H. filipjevi and H. latipons populations was investigated in-vitro conditions. According to results, the effect of resistance genes showed variation depending on different Cereal cyst nematode populations; H.avenae, H. filipjevi and H. latipons. Although Cre1 gene was only found as completely resistant to all (three) nematode species, Cre3 and Cre7 were found resistant to H. avenae and H. latipons. Cre R was also determined as resistant to H. filipjevi and H. latipons populations but Cre8 was only found resistant against to H. filipjevi population. No resistance was found in Cre 2 gene against to all nematode populations. Additionally, 2 resistance gene-free variety and lines were found resistant to H. avenae; 3 wheat lines to H. filipjevi and 11 wheat genotypes were found moderately resistant to H. latipons.

AB Protein is the second most abundant constituent in the rice grain next to starch. Association analysis for protein concentration in brown rice was performed using a "mini-core" collection, which represents the germplasm diversity found in the USDA rice world collection. Protein concentration was determined in replicated trials conducted in two southern U. S. locations, and association mapping was performed by using 157 genomewide DNA markers. Protein concentration ranged from 5.4 to 11.9% among the 202 accessions. Protein variation owing to accession and accession x location interaction were highly significant. Ample variation was seen within each subpopulation by ancestry, as well as within the 14 geographic regions where the accessions originated. Accessions from Eastern Europe had the highest level of protein. Ten markers on eight chromosomes were significantly associated with protein concentration. Five of these markers occurred near known protein precursor genes or quantitative trait loci, and the other five markers were novel for the association with protein concentration in rice. The germplasm and genetic markers identified in this study will assist breeders in developing cultivars tailored for applications requiring specific protein concentration in the rice grain. The research results contribute to the potential discovery of novel rice storage protein pathways in the endosperm.

AB Ninety-nine wheat cultivars from six different agro-climatic zones of India were analyzed for the Vrn-1, Vrn-2, Vrn-B3, Vrn-4 and Ppd-D1 composition with DNA sequenced based allele specific or linked markers for the above-mentioned genes. A majority of the germplasm carried the dominant Vrn-A1a allele alone or in combination with Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1. The three dominant genes were cumulatively present in 30 cultivars among all the zones, whereas double dominant combination, Vrn-A1/Vrn-B1 was identified in 18 cultivars, Vrn-A1/Vrn-D1 in 6 cvs and Vrn-B1/Vrn-D1 in 16 cvs. The combination of the dominant alleles of all three genes was most frequent in cvs of Northern Western Plains Zone. Northern Hill Zone had vrn-B1 and vrn-D1 alleles in higher proportions compared to the dominant alleles Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 indicating successful spring/winter wheat cross breeding. All of the cvs had the recessive Vrn-B3 allele. Most of the cvs had photoperiod insensitive allele in all the zones and only 9% cvs possessed the photoperiod sensitive allele (b) of the Ppd-D1 gene. This information will be useful in selecting parental lines for crossing to maximize diversity at these loci and for future molecular marker assisted breeding for cultivar improvement.

AB Grass inflorescence and stem branches show recognizable architectural differences among species. The inflorescence branches of Triticeae cereals and grasses, including wheat, barley, and 400-500 wild species, are usually contracted into a spike formation, with the number of flowering branches (spikelets) per node conserved within species and genera. Perennial Triticeae grasses of genus Leymus are unusual in that the number of spikelets per node varies, inflorescences may have panicle branches, and vegetative stems may form subterranean rhizomes. Leymus cinereus and L. triticoides show discrete differences in inflorescence length, branching architecture, node number, and density; number of spikelets per node and florets per spikelet; culm length and width; and perimeter of rhizomatous spreading. Quantitative trait loci controlling these traits were detected in 2 pseudo-backcross populations derived from the interspecific hybrids using a linkage map with 360 expressed gene sequence markers from Leymus tiller and rhizome branch meristems. Alignments of genes, mutations, and quantitative trait loci controlling similar traits in other grass species were identified using the Brachypodium genome reference sequence. Evidence suggests that loci controlling inflorescence and stem branch architecture in Leymus are conserved among the grasses, are governed by natural selection, and can serve as possible gene targets for improving seed, forage, and grain production.

AB Wheat grain storage protein (GSP) content and composition are the main determinants of the end-use value of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain. The accumulation of glutenins and gliadins, the two main classes of GSP in wheat, is believed to be mainly controlled at the transcriptional level through a network of transcription factors. This regulation network could lead to stable cross-environment allometric scaling relationships between the quantity of GSP classes/subunits and the total quantity of nitrogen per grain. This work conducted a genetic mapping study of GSP content and composition and allometric scaling parameters of grain N allocation using a bread wheat worldwide core collection grown in three environments. The core collection was genotyped with 873 markers for genome-wide association and 167 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 51 candidate genes for candidate association. The candidate genes included 35 transcription factors (TFs) expressed in grain. This work identified 74 loci associated with 38 variables, of which 19 were candidate genes or were tightly linked with candidate genes. Besides structural GSP genes, several loci putatively trans-regulating GSP accumulation were identified. Seven candidate TFs, including four wheat orthologues of barley TFs that control hordein gene expression, were associated or in strong linkage disequilibrium with markers associated with the composition or quantity of glutenin or gliadin, or allometric grain N allocation parameters, confirming the importance of the transcriptional control of GSP accumulation. Genome-wide association results suggest that the genes regulating glutenin and gliadin compositions are mostly distinct from each other and operate differently.

AB Microspore embryogenesis involves reprogramming of the pollen immature cell towards embryogenesis. We have identified and characterized a collection of 14 genes induced along different morphological phases of microspore-derived embryo development in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) anther culture. SERKs and FLAs genes previously associated with somatic embryogenesis and reproductive tissues, respectively, were also included in this analysis. Genes involved in signalling mechanisms such as TaTPD1-like and TAA1b, and two glutathione S-transferase (GSTF2 and GSTA2) were induced when microspores had acquired a 'star-like' morphology or had undergone the first divisions. Genes associated with control of plant development and stress response (TaNF-YA, TaAGL14, TaFLA26, CHI3, XIP-R; Tad1 and WALI6) were activated before exine rupture. When the multicellular structures have been released from the exine, TaEXPB4, TaAGP31-like and an unknown embryo-specific gene TaME1 were induced. Comparison of gene expression, between two wheat cultivars with different response to anther culture, showed that the profile of genes activated before exine rupture was shifted to earlier stages in the low responding cultivar. This collection of genes constitutes a value resource for study mechanism of intra-embryo communication, early pattern formation, cell wall modification and embryo differentiation.

AB Improved end-use quality is an essential goal of many wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs. Besides genetic factors, environmental conditions are known to influence wheat quality. Our objective was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for quality traits in a winter wheat population under different soil moisture levels. A population of 185 doubled haploid (DH) lines was derived from a cross between hard white winter wheats CO940610 and 'Platte'. The population was grown in four environments (two limited irrigation and two fully irrigated) in Colorado in 2007/2008 and 2008/2009, and the grain was evaluated for 14 end-use quality traits. A linkage map was constructed with 250 molecular markers, including five glutenin protein markers. Composite interval mapping detected clusters of QTL for multiple traits near the glutenin loci Glu-A1, Glu-B1, and Glu-D1. Other QTL clusters were located on chromosomes 2B, 6A, 7B, and 7D; the 2B and 7D QTL may reflect the presence of heading date QTL in the same regions. An epistatic interaction for mixograph traits was found between the chromosome 7B QTL and Glu-B1, consistent with the presence of a regulatory gene on 7B. An apparently novel QTL for kernel weight and diameter was detected on chromosome 3B. Our results confirm similar genetic control of quality traits, especially for large-effect QTL, for the levels of moisture stress in this study. These results may guide breeding programs in choosing parents and conducting marker-assisted selection for improved end-use quality.

AB The genetic diversity of specific Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lini from six provinces in China was investigated using molecular markers, inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). Based on the morphological features and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, 96 isolates were identified as Fusarium oxysporum. The 96 isolates were amplified by PCR with 12 ISSR primers. The number of bands amplified by each primer ranged from 43 to 142, with sizes ranging from 250 to 4,500 bp. A total of 800 bands were observed, out of which 797 were polymorphic (99.62%). The percentage of polymorphic loci varied from 17.25% in Gansu and Inner Mongolia to 33.75% in Sinkiang. Nei's gene diversity index (h) ranged from 0.0428 in Gansu to 0.0666 in Sinkiang, and Shannon's information index (I) ranged from 0.0675 in Gansu to 0.1117 in Sinkiang. The genetic identity using the Nei's genetic identity varied from 0.9643 between the populations from Hebei and Gansu to 0.9844 between the populations from Sinkiang and Shanxi. Unweighted pair group mean analysis (UPGMA) cluster analysis, as indicated by the Nei's genetic distance, showed the distances ranging from 0.0158 between the populations from Sinkiang and Shanxi to 0.0364 between the populations from Hebei and Gansu. The six populations were clustered into three subgroups. The Gansu population was clustered into one subgroup, the same as the Inner Mongolia population. The four other populations were clustered into the third subgroup. The Nei's GST (0.2972) and gene flow among populations (Nm =1.1825) revealed large gene exchanges among populations.

AB The use of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) to reduce requirements for mineral nitrogen fertilization in sustainable agriculture is an important issue. We studied how reduced nitrogen fertilization affects the growth-promoting capacity of Enterobacter radicincitans, the bacteria's root colonization behavior, and the regulation of nitrogen, phosphate and hormone marker genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).
   Tomato seeds inoculated with 10(7) cfu mL(-1) E. radicincitans or 0.05 M NaCl, were grown under two distinct nitrogen fertilization regimes.
   When treated with E. radicincitans, plant root or shoot dry weight increased by 180 %, or 150 % in high nitrogen (HN) conditions, but increased only by 120 %, or 140 % in low nitrogen (LN) conditions. HN plants were colonized by a higher number of total bacteria, including E. radicincitans, than LN plants. We found that E. radicincitans-treated plants expressed higher levels of a pathogen defense-related marker gene in LN conditions than in HN conditions. Transcription of the oxylipin biosynthesis marker genes was suppressed in E. radicincitans-treated plants under both fertilization regimes.
   Our findings indicate that drastic reduction in nitrogen fertilization results in modulating plant hormone signaling, thus inhibiting the optimal effect of E. radicincitans on tomato.

AB The Lr34 gene encodes an ABC transporter and has provided wheat with durable, broad-spectrum resistance against multiple fungal pathogens for over 100 years. Because barley does not have an Lr34 ortholog, we expressed Lr34 in barley to investigate its potential as a broad-spectrum resistance resource in another grass species. We found that introduction of the genomic Lr34 sequence confers resistance against barley leaf rust and barley powdery mildew, two pathogens specific for barley but not virulent on wheat. In addition, the barley lines showed enhanced resistance against wheat stem rust. Transformation with the Lr34 cDNA or the genomic susceptible Lr34 allele did not result in increased resistance. Unlike wheat, where Lr34-conferred resistance is associated with adult plants, the genomic Lr34 transgenic barley lines exhibited multipathogen resistance in seedlings. These transgenic barley lines also developed leaf tip necrosis (LTN) in young seedlings, which correlated with an up-regulation of senescence marker genes and several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. In wheat, transcriptional expression of Lr34 is highest in adult plants and correlates with increased resistance and LTN affecting the last emerging leaf. The severe phenotype of transgenic Lr34 barley resulted in reduced plant growth and total grain weight. These results demonstrate that Lr34 provides enhanced multipathogen resistance early in barley plant development and implies the conservation of the substrate and mechanism of the LR34 transporter and its molecular action between wheat and barley. With controlled gene expression, the use of Lr34 may be valuable for many cereal breeding programmes, particularly given its proven durability.

AB TaSnRK2.8, an SnRK2 (sucrose non-fermenting1-related protein kinase 2) member of wheat, confers enhanced multi-stress tolerances in carbohydrate metabolism. In the study, two types of genomic sequences of TaSnRK2.8 were detected in common wheat. Sequencing analysis showed that there was a variation-enriched region, designated TaSnRK2.8-A-C, covering the eighth intron, the ninth exon and the 3'-flanking region of TaSnRK2.8-A, and no divergence occurred in TaSnRK2.8-B. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TaSnRK2.8-A-C region were investigated in 165 wheat accessions. Three of 751 sequenced nucleotide sites were polymorphic. Nucleotide diversity (pi) in the region was 0.00068. Sliding-window analysis demonstrated that the nucleotide diversity was highest in the 3'-flanking sequence. As predicted, the highly frequent SNP was significantly associated with seedling biomass under normal conditions, plant height, flag leaf width and water-soluble carbohydrate content under drought conditions. Analysis of variance of correlated traits between accessions with the A and G genotypes indicated that the A variant was the more favorable allele associated with significantly increased seedling biomass and water-soluble carbohydrates. Based on the SNP, we developed a functional marker of TaSnRK2.8-A-C, that could be utilized in wheat breeding programs aimed at improving seedling biomass and water-soluble carbohydrates, and consequently to enhance stress resistance in wheat.

AB Diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L. is a model plant for wheat functional genomics. Chlorophyll-deficient mutant (clm1) was identified during manual screening of the ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-treated M-2 progenies of T. monococcum accession pau14087 in the field. The clm1 mutant, due to significantly decreased chlorophyll content compared with the wild-type (WT), exhibited pale yellow leaves which slowly recovered to green before flowering. The clm1 mutant showed early flowering, reduced number of tillers, trichome length and density, and different shape as compared with the WT. At the same time, clm1 mutant culm had more chlorophyll-containing parenchymatous tissues compared to WT, presumably to absorb more sunlight for photosynthesis. Genetic analysis indicated that the clm1 mutation was monogenic recessive. The clm1 mutant was mapped between Xgwm473 and Xwmc96 SSR markers, with genetic distances of 2.1 and 2.6 cM, respectively, on the 7A(m)L chromosome.

AB Hybrid weakness (HW) is an important postzygotic isolation which occurs in both intra-and inter-specific crosses. In this study, we described a novel low temperature-dependent intrasubspecific hybrid weakness in the F-1 plants derived from the cross between two indica rice varieties Taifeng A and V1134. HW plants showed growth retardation, reduced panicle number and pale green leaves with chlorotic spots. Cytological assay showed that there were reduced cell numbers, larger intercellular spaces, thicker cell walls, and abnormal development of chloroplast and mitochondria in the mature leaves from HW F-1 plants in comparison with that from both of the parental lines. Genetic analysis revealed that HW was controlled by two complementary dominant genes Hw3 from V1134 and Hw4 from Taifeng A. Hw3 was mapped in a 136 kb interval between the markers Indel1118 and Indel1117 on chromosome 11, and Hw4 was mapped in the region of about 15 cM between RM182 and RM505 on chromosome 7, respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed that only LOC_Os11g44310, encoding a putative calmodulin-binding protein (OsCaMBP), differentially expressed among Taifeng A, V1134 and their HW F-1. No recombinant was detected using the markers designed based on the sequence of LOC_Os11g44310 in the BC1F2 (Taifeng A//Taifeng A/V1134) population. Hence, LOC_Os11g44310 was probably the candidate gene of Hw3. Gene amplification suggested that LOC_Os11g44310 was present in V1134 and absent in Taifeng A. BLAST search revealed that LOC_Os11g44310 had one copy in the japonica genomic sequence of Nipponbare, and no homologous sequence in the indica reference sequence of 9311. Our results indicate that Hw3 is a novel gene for inducing hybrid weakness in rice.

AB Wild roses are widespread throughout North America but it is only recently that commercial interests have increased worldwide for rosehip products. Rosehip production under field conditions is new for North American wild roses and the cultivated materials are not well characterized. Despite recent phylogenetic studies on North American roses, micro-evolutionary studies at regional level in terms of genetic and metabolite diversity are scarce. We have characterized 30 wild rose ecotypes collected from different regions Prince Edward Island using microsatellite (SSR) markers, SNP of the chloroplast trnaL intron and the nuclear gene GAPDH, ploidy determination as well as the metabolite profiling for major phenolics and fatty acids. A total of 244 SSR alleles, with an average of 12.2 per marker were observed. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged between 0.00 and 0.97, with an average of 0.70. Cluster analysis showed three main clusters, cluster 3 showing the greatest diversity. Within each cluster, the ecotypes also showed large metabolite diversity, reflective of their genetic diversity. The data suggests the potential for the cultivation of a given ecotype for its unique metabolite profile or it incorporation in breeding programs. The ploidy and phylogenetic studies showed that all 30 ecotypes were tetraploid and that the collection is consisted of Rosa virginiana and its natural hybrids with Rosa carolina.

The alien addition line 2-1-6-3 was shown to have two P. huashanica chromosomes, with a meiotic configuration of 2n = 44 = 22 II. We tested 55 EST-SSR and 336 EST-STS primer pairs that mapped onto seven different wheat chromosomes using DNA from parents and the P. huashanica addition line. One EST-SSR and nine EST-STS primer pairs indicated that the additional chromosome of P. huashanica belonged to homoeologous group 7, the diagnostic fragments of five EST-STS markers (BE404955, BE591127, BE637663, BF482781 and CD452422) were cloned, sequenced and compared. The results showed that the amplified polymorphic bands of P. huashanica and disomic addition line 2-1-6-3 shared 100% sequence identity, which was designated as the 7Ns disomic addition line. Disomic addition line 2-1-6-3 was evaluated to test the leaf rust resistance of adult stages in the field. We found that one pair of the 7Ns genome chromosomes carried new leaf rust resistance gene(s). Moreover, wheat line 2-1-6-3 had a superior numbers of florets and grains per spike, which were associated with the introgression of the paired P. huashanica chromosomes. These high levels of disease resistance and stable, excellent agronomic traits suggest that this line could be utilized as a novel donor in wheat breeding programs.

AB Diploid Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. comosa and their natural allotetraploid hybrids Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata are important wild gene sources for wheat. With the aim of assisting in alien gene transfer, this study provides gene-based conserved orthologous set (COS) markers for the U and M genome chromosomes. Out of the 140 markers tested on a series of wheat-Aegilops chromosome introgression lines and flow-sorted subgenomic chromosome fractions, 100 were assigned to Aegilops chromosomes and six and seven duplications were identified in the U and M genomes, respectively. The marker-specific EST sequences were BLAST-ed to Brachypodium and rice genomic sequences to investigate macrosyntenic relationships between the U and M genomes of Aegilops, wheat and the model species. Five syntenic regions of Brachypodium identified genome rearrangements differentiating the U genome from the M genome and from the D genome of wheat. All of them seem to have evolved at the diploid level and to have been modified differentially in the polyploid species Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata. A certain level of wheat-Aegilops homology was detected for group 1, 2, 3 and 5 chromosomes, while a clearly rearranged structure was showed for the group 4, 6 and 7 Aegilops chromosomes relative to wheat. The conserved orthologous set markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes promise to accelerate gene introgression by facilitating the identification of alien chromatin. The syntenic relationships between the Aegilops species, wheat and model species will facilitate the targeted development of new markers specific for U and M genomic regions and will contribute to the understanding of molecular processes related to allopolyploidization.

AB The availability of crop specimens archived in herbaria and old seed collections represent valuable resources for the analysis of plant genetic diversity and crop domestication. The ability to extract ancient DNA (aDNA) from such samples has recently allowed molecular genetic investigations to be undertaken in ancient materials. While analyses of aDNA initially focused on the use of markers which occur in multiple copies such as the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) within ribosomal DNA and those requiring amplification of short DNA regions of variable length such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs), emphasis is now moving towards the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), traditionally undertaken in aDNA by Sanger sequencing. Here, using a panel of barley aDNA samples previously surveyed by Sanger sequencing for putative causative SNPs within the flowering-time gene PPD-H1, we assess the utility of the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping platform for aDNA analysis. We find KASP to out-perform Sanger sequencing in the genotyping of aDNA samples (78% versus 61% success, respectively), as well as being robust to contamination. The small template size (>= 46 bp) and one-step, closed-tube amplification/genotyping process make this platform ideally suited to the genotypic analysis of aDNA, a process which is often hampered by template DNA degradation and sample cross-contamination. Such attributes, as well as its flexibility of use and relatively low cost, make KASP particularly relevant to the genetic analysis of aDNA samples. Furthermore, KASP provides a common platform for the genotyping and analysis of corresponding SNPs in ancient, landrace and modern plant materials. The extended haplotype analysis of PPD-HI undertaken here (allelic variation at which is thought to be important for the spread of domestication and local adaptation) provides further resolution to the previously identified geographic cline of flowering-time allele distribution, illustrating how KASP can be used to aid genetic analyses of aDNA from plant species. We further demonstrate the utility of KASP by genotyping ten additional genetic markers diagnostic for morphological traits in barley, shedding light on the phenotypic traits, alleles and allele combinations present in these unviable ancient specimens, as well as their geographic distributions.

AB Three sets of hexaploid introgressive triticale lines, with Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum (cultivated einkorn wheat) genes and a bread wheat chromosome 1D substituted for chromosome 1A, and one set of secondary triticale lines were evaluated for grain and flour physicochemical and dough rheological characteristics in two generations (F7 and F8). Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the 1D/1A chromosome substitution. The presence or absence of einkorn high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits and the wheat Glu-D1d locus encoding the 5 + 10 subunits was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), capillary zone electrophoresis, and allele-specific molecular markers. Significant differences were found among physicochemical properties (with the exception of the Hagberg falling number) of all introgressive Triticale/T. monococcum lines and the secondary triticale lines. The wheat 1D/1A chromosome substitution also affected these properties. The results showed that in all introgressive triticale lines, the protein and gluten content, Zeleny sedimentation value, and water absorption capacity, were increased. The rheological parameters estimated using micro-farinograph, reomixer, and Kieffer dough extensibility systems also showed an appreciable increase in dough-mixing properties, maximum resistance to extension (R-max), and dough extensibility. Introgressive Triticale/T. monococcum lines with 5 + 10 subunits have particularly favorable rheological parameters. The results obtained in this study suggest that the cultivated einkorn genome A(m), in the context of hexaploid secondary triticale lines and with a wheat 1D/1A substitution, has the potential to improve gluten polymer interactions and be a valuable genetic resource for triticale quality improvement.

AB Strubes Dickkopf is the sixth differential in the world set for wheat stripe (yellow) rust. It is very important to clarify its genetic character of resistance to stripe rust and to develop the molecular markers linked to resistance genes. The NIL Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf, which was obtained by Strubes Dickkopf as the gene donor and Taichung 29 as the genetic background through backcross breeding, was crossed with the recurrent parent Taichung 29, inbred, and backcrossed to obtain the F-1, F-2 and BC1 population. The genetic analysis of the cross Taichung 29/(Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf) was assessed by inoculating the rust race CYR26 at seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and F-2 segregation analysis were used for detecting polymorphic primers to locate the gene. The resistance of the NIL Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf to CYR26 was controlled by a single dominant gene, named YrSD. The primer pair Xbarc59 on 5B was linked to YrSD and the genetic distance between Xbarc59 and YrSD was 2.4 cM. The molecular marker Xbarc59 closely linked to the gene YrSD could be used in marker-assisted selection for resistance to stripe rust in wheat breeding programmes.

AB The African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rice (Oryza sativa) are important economic crops. The rice genome has been more extensively characterised and studied compared to oil palm. GBrowse, a bioinformatics tool for visualising genomic and other sequences along a reference genome was applied in this study. Herein, we report the use of model organism Oryza sativa as a reference genome to map 75 463 genomic E. guineensis sequences. A subset of 328 oil palm sequences that aligned well to the 12 rice chromosomes was shortlisted for further analysis. Of these 328 genomic sequences, 261 contained microsatellite motifs and were apt for primer design. A total of 208 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) were selected to screen for polymorphism in a subset of palms from a selfed Nigerian tenera mapping population (T128), whereby, 67 SSR were found to be polymorphic. Thirty-eight of the polymorphic markers were mapped onto the genetic map. In comparison to the 12 rice chromosomes, six SSR from the oil palm linkage group 1 (LG1), containing the shell gene (SH) locus were identified on chromosomes 2 and 5 of rice. The order of these six SSR on linkage group 1 was mostly similar to that in chromosomes 2 and 5 of rice. The study provided evidence on synteny between oil palm and rice and facilitated the mapping of a marker closer to SH locus.

AB The primary aim of plant breeders is to develop new cultivars in order to improve productivity and to combat threats from pests and diseases. Recent advances in genomics have been recognised as providing important tools for plant breeders in the form of molecular genetic markers that can be used to tag genes of interest. However, the cost-effective use of marker technology is dependent on the nature and timing of the use of such markers. A conventional potato breeding programme typically creates a large breeding population and then employs phenotypic recurrent selection over a number of generations to identify superior genotypes. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) provides the advantage of being applicable at the seedling or an early generation stage. We have analysed the cost of MAS and compared it to conventional screening, then modelled the respective costs against the breeding population size of the generation in which they would be applied to determine whether MAS in the early generations of a potato breeding programme would be cost-effective. As various potato breeding programmes employ different selection rates in early generations, these rates have also been modelled to determine the effect. Our results indicate that MAS could be applied cost-effectively in the second clonal generation for all models currently employed in potato breeding.

AB Plant height is an important botanical feature closely related to yield. Two populations consisting of 118 and 262 accessions respectively were used to identify elite alleles for plant height and to validate their allelic effects. Plant height was measured from the early booting to the flowering stages. Simple sequence repeat markers for candidate quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions with large effects identified in a doubled haploid (DH) population (Hanxuan 10 x Lumai 14) were selected for further verification by association analysis. Nine loci significantly (P < 0.001) associated with plant height were detected 13 times in the population with 118 accessions. Three loci (Xgwm11-1B, Xwmc349-4B and Xcfd23-4D) were identified in three, two and two periods of plant height growth, respectively. Markers Xbarc168-2D, Xgwm249-2D, Xwmc349-4B, Xcfd23-4D and Xgwm410-5A located at or near additive QTL regions in the DH population proved to coincide with known Rht loci. The results showed a consistency between linkage analysis and association mapping, and also confirmed the value of fine mapping of QTL through combined linkage and association analyses. For final plant height, the alleles Xgwm11-1B (208) , Xwmc349-4B (103) and Xcfd23-4D (202) exhibited negative effects, i.e. reducing plant height; Xwmc349-4B (101) and Xcfd23-4D (205) showed significant positive effects. A second larger population (262 accessions) was used to validate the effects of these large-effect alleles and the efficacy of pyramiding in eight environments (year x site x water regime combinations). Strong correlations between final plant height and numbers of large-effect alleles indicated that the alleles contributed additively to plant height. The additive effects showed that pyramiding elite alleles for target traits has significant potential for wheat breeding.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating diseases worldwide and is also an important disease in China. The wheat translocation line H9014-121-5-5-9 was originally developed from interspecific hybridization between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line 7182 and Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng. This translocation line showed resistance to predominant stripe rust races in China when it was tested with nine races of Pst. To determine the inheritance and map the resistance gene, segregating populations were developed from the cross between H9014-121-5-5-9 and the susceptible cultivar Mingxian 169. The seedlings of the F1, F2, and F2:3 generations were tested with race CYR31. The results showed that the resistance in H9014-121-5-5-9 was conferred by a single dominant gene. Bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to identify polymorphic markers associated with the resistance gene locus. Seven polymorphic SSR markers were linked to the resistance gene. A linkage map was constructed according to the genotypes of the seven SSR markers and the resistance gene. Based on the SSR marker positions on the wheat chromosome, the resistance gene was assigned on chromosome 1AL, temporarily designated YrHA. Based on chromosomal location, reaction patterns and pedigree analysis, YrHA should be a novel resistance gene to stripe rust. The molecular markers of the new resistance gene in H9014-121-5-5-9 could be useful for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs against stripe rust.

AB Genome-wide marker-trait associations (MTA) were established in a population of 358 European winter wheat cultivars and 14 spring wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) for resistance to Septoria tritici blotch caused by the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola. The MTA were based on field data in two consecutive years and genotypic data on 732 microsatellite markers. Best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) for resistance were calculated across the trials and ranged from 0.67 (most resistant) to 19.63 (most susceptible) with an average value of 4.93. A total of 115 MTA relating to 68 molecular markers was discovered for the two trials and BLUEs by using a mixed linear model corrected by a kinship matrix. In addition, two candidate genes, Ppd-D1 for photoperiodism and the dwarfing gene Rht-D1, were significantly associated with resistance to Septoria tritici blotch. Several MTA co-located with known resistance genes, e.g. Stb1, 3, 4, 6 and 8, while multiple additional MTA were discovered on several chromosomes, such as 2A, 2D, 3A, 5B, 7A and 7D. The results provide proof of concept for the method of genome-wide association analysis and indicate the presence of further Stb resistance genes in the European winter wheat pool.

AB The occurrence of late maturity alpha-amylase (LMA) was investigated using two doubled haploid wheat populations segregating for the dwarfing gene Rht-D1b and the 1B/1R translocation. Genotypes were assessed in the field and in controlled environments where a cold-shock treatment was used to induce LMA. Results from field-grown genotypes from the cross Spark x Rialto suggest that the absence of Rht-D1b or the presence of the 1B/1R translocation increases the expression of LMA.These two genetic factors were found to act independently and to have a positive interaction (complementary epistasis). In Option x Potent genotypes fixed for Rht-D1b, the 1B/1R effect was similar to that seen in the equivalent Spark x Rialto genotypes. Under controlled environment conditions, genotypes with the 1B/1R translocation showed a higher occurrence of LMA under both control and cold-shock conditions. 1B/1R was present in the majority of genotypes expressing LMA under control and cold-shock conditions. The results point to the novel finding that the 1B/1R translocation increases the expression of alpha-amylase in LMA-prone germplasm independently of effects of Rht-D1b, whereas previously it had been thought to act by a modification of the Rht-D1b effect.

AB Grain mold and rust are diseases that can significantly reduce sorghum grain yield. Breeding for resistance to these diseases is hindered by inefficient disease screening. A viable option to greatly improve breeding efficiency is to identify molecular markers or genes linked to the host resistance. In this study, we applied 14,739 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to the sorghum mini core of 242 accessions that had been evaluated for rust resistance in both greenhouse and field and for grain mold in the field for 2 years. Through association mapping we have identified two loci linked to grain mold resistance and five loci linked to rust resistance. Among the two loci linked to grain mold resistance, one contained a homolog of the maize nonhost resistance gene Rxo1. Two of rust-linked loci each contained the rust resistance gene homologous to the maize rust resistance gene Rp1-D which is the B locus (the A locus containing Pu was not linked in this study) and to the wheat rust resistance gene Lr1. The remaining loci contained genes important in other steps of the defense response, such as cyclophilins that mediate resistance response preceding hypersensitive response (HR) and Hin1 directly involved in producing HR. The results from this study will facilitate marker-assisted selection of host resistance to grain mold and rust in sorghum.

AB Gene order is largely collinear in the small-grained cereals, a feature which has proved helpful in both marker development and positional cloning. The accuracy of a virtual gene order map ("genome zipper") for barley (Hordeum vulgare), developed by combining a genetic map of this species with a large number of gene locations obtained from the maps constructed in other grass species, was evaluated here both at the genome-wide level and at the fine scale in a representative segment of the genome. Comparing the whole genome "genome zipper" maps with a genetic map developed by using transcript-derived markers, yielded an accuracy of > 94 %. The fine-scale comparison involved a 14 cM segment of chromosome arm 2HL. One hundred twenty-eight genes of the "genome zipper" interval were analysed. Over 95 % (45/47) of the polymorphic markers were genetically mapped and allocated to the expected region of 2HL, following the predicted order. A further 80 of the 128 genes were assigned to the correct chromosome arm 2HL by analysis of wheat-barley addition lines. All 128 gene-based markers developed were used to probe a barley bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, delivering 26 BAC contigs from which all except two were anchored to the targeted zipper interval. The results demonstrate that the gene order predicted by the "genome zipper" is remarkably accurate and that the "genome zipper" represents a highly efficient informational resource for the systematic identification of gene-based markers and subsequent physical map anchoring of the barley genome.

AB Flag leaf width (FLW) is directly related to photosynthetic capacity and yield potential in wheat. In a previous study, Qflw.nau-5A controlling FLW was detected on chromosome 5A in the interval possessing Fhb5 for type I Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance using a recombinant inbred line population derived from Nanda2419 x Wangshuibai.
   Qflw.nau-5A near-isogenic line (NIL) with the background of Mianyang 99-323 and PH691 was developed and evaluated. FLW inheritance was investigated using two F-2 populations developed from crossing the Qflw.nau-5A NILs with their recurrent parents. One hundred ten and 28 recombinants, which included 10 and 5 types of recombinants, were identified from 2816 F-2 plants with Mianyang 99-323 background and 1277 F-2 plants with PH691 background, respectively, and phenotyped in field trials for FLW and type I FHB resistance. Deletion bin mapping was applied to physically map Qflw.nau-5A.
   The introduction of Wangshuibai Qflw.nau-5A allele reduced the FLW up to 3 mm. In the F-2 populations, Qflw.nau-5A was inherited like a semi-dominant gene, and was therefore designated as TaFLW1. The FLW of the recombinant lines displayed a distinct two-peak distribution. Recombinants with wider leaves commonly have Mianyang 99-323 or PH691 chromatin in the 0.2 cM Xwmc492-Xwmc752 interval that resided in the 5AL12-0.35-0.57 deletion bin, and recombinants with narrow leaves were Wangshuibai genotype in this interval. Phenotypic recombination between FLW and type I FHB resistance was identified, implying TaFLW1 was in close linkage with Fhb5. These results should aid wheat breeders to break the linkage drag through marker-assisted selection and assist in the map-based cloning of TaFLW1.

AB Earliness per se regulates flowering time independent of environmental signals and helps to fine tune the time of flowering and maturity. In this study, we aimed to map earliness per se quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting days to flowering and maturity in a population developed by crossing two spring wheat cultivars, Cutler and AC Barrie. The population of 177 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was genotyped for a total of 488 SSR and DArT polymorphic markers on all 21 chromosomes. Three QTLs of earliness per se affecting days to flowering and maturity were mapped on chromosomes 1B (QEps.dms-1B1 and QEps.dms-1B2) and 5B (QEps.dms-5B1), in individual environments and when all the environments were combined. A QTL affecting flowering time (QFlt.dms-4A1) was identified on chromosome 4A. Two grain yield QTLs were mapped on chromosome 5B, while one QTL was mapped on chromosome 1D. The population segregated for the photoperiod insensitive gene, Ppd-D1a, and it induced earlier flowering by 0.69 days and maturity by 1.28 days. The photoperiod insensitive allele Ppd-D1a interacted in an additive fashion with QTLs for flowering and maturity times. The earliness per se QTL QFlt.dms-5B.1 inducing earlier flowering could help to elongate grain filling duration for higher grain yield. Hence, chromosome 5B possesses promising genomic regions that may be introgressed for higher grain yield with earlier maturity through marker-assisted selection in bread wheat.

AB Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is defined as a stochastic dependence between alleles at two or more loci. Although understanding LD is important in the study of the genetics of many species, little attention has been paid on how a covariance structure between many loci distributed across the genome should be represented. Given that biological systems at the cellular level often involve gene networks, it is appealing to evaluate LD from a network perspective, i.e., as a set of associated loci involved in a complex system. We applied a Markov network (MN) to study LD using data on 1,279 markers derived from 599 wheat inbred lines. The MN attempts to account for association between two markers, conditionally on the remaining markers in the network model. In this study, the recovery of the structure of a LD network was done through two variants of pseudo-likelihoods subject to an L1 penalty on the MN parameters. It is shown that, while the L1-regularized Markov network preserves features of a Bayesian network (BN), the nodes in the resulting networks have fewer links. The resulting sparse network, encoding conditional independencies, provides a clearer picture of association than marginal LD metrics, and a sparse graph eases interpretation markedly, since it includes a smaller number of edges than a BN. Thus, an L1-regularized sparse Markov network seems appealing for representing conditional LD with high-dimensional genomic data, where variables, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are expected to be sparsely connected.

AB Hessian fly (HF), Mayetiola destructor, is an important pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Because it has multiple biotypes that are virulent to different wheat HF resistance genes, pyramiding multiple resistance genes in a cultivar can improve resistance durability, and finding DNA markers tightly linked to these genes is essential to this process. This study identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Hessian fly resistance (HFR) in the wheat cultivar 'Clark' and tightly linked DNA markers for the QTLs. A linkage map was constructed with single nucleotide polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross 'Ning7840' x 'Clark' by single-seed descent. Two QTLs associated with resistance to fly biotype GP were identified on chromosomes 6B and 1A, with the resistance alleles contributed from 'Clark'. The QTL on 6B flanked by loci Xsnp921 and Xsnp2745 explained about 37.2 % of the phenotypic variation, and the QTL on 1A was flanked by Xgwm33 and Xsnp5150 and accounted for 13.3 % of phenotypic variation for HFR. The QTL on 6B has not been reported before and represents a novel wheat gene with resistance to HF, thus, it is designated H34. A significant positive epistasis was detected between the two QTLs that accounted for about 9.5 % of the mean phenotypic variation and increased HFR by 0.16. Our results indicated that different QTLs may contribute different degrees of resistance in a cultivar and that epistasis may play an important role in HFR.

AB The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) has been a major pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in North America since it was first reported in 2000. Our previous study revealed that the strong aphid resistance of plant introduction (PI) 567598B was controlled by two recessive genes. The objective of this study was to locate these two genes on the soybean genetic linkage map using molecular markers. A mapping population of 282 F-4:5 lines derived from IA2070 x E06902 was evaluated for aphid resistance in a field trial in 2009 and a greenhouse trial in 2010. Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified using the composite and multiple interval mapping methods, and were mapped on chromosomes 7 (linkage group M) and 16 (linkage group J), respectively. E06902, a parent derived from PI 567598B, conferred resistance at both loci. In the 2010 greenhouse trial, each of the two QTLs explained over 30 % of the phenotypic variation. Significant epistatic interaction was also found between these two QTLs. However, in the 2009 field trial, only the QTL on chromosome 16 was found and it explained 56.1 % of the phenotypic variation. These two QTLs and their interaction were confirmed with another population consisting of 94 F-2:5 lines in the 2008 and 2009 greenhouse trials. For both trials in the alternative population, these two loci explained about 50 and 80.4 % of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. Our study shows that soybean aphid isolate used in the 2009 field trial defeated the QTL found on chromosome 7. Presence of the QTL on chromosome 16 conferred soybean aphid resistance in all trials. The markers linked to the aphid-resistant QTLs in PI 567598B or its derived lines can be used in marker-assisted breeding for aphid resistance.

AB Understanding the genetics underlying yield formation of wheat is important for increasing wheat yield potential in breeding programs. Nanda2419 was a widely used cultivar for wheat production and breeding in China. In this study, we evaluated yield components and a few yield-related traits of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population created by crossing Nanda2419 with the indigenous cultivar Wangshuibai in three to four trials at different geographical locations. Negative and positive correlations were found among some of these evaluated traits. Five traits had over 50 % trial-wide broad sense heritability. Using a framework marker map of the genome constructed with this population, quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for all traits, and epistatic loci were identified for seven of them. Our results confirmed some of the previously reported QTLs in wheat and identified several new ones, including QSn.nau-6D for effective tillers, QGn.nau-4B.2 for kernel number, QGw.nau-4D for kernel weight, QPh.nau-4B.2 and QPh.nau-4A for plant height, and QFlw.nau-5A.1 for flag leaf width. In the investigated population, Nanda2419 contributed all QTLs associated with higher kernel weight, higher leaf chlorophyll content, and a major QTL associated with wider flag leaf. Seven chromosome regions were related to more than one trait. Four QTL clusters contributed positively to breeding goal-based trait improvement through the Nanda2419 alleles and were detected in trials set in different ecological regions. The findings of this study are relevant to the molecular improvement of wheat yield and to the goal of screening cultivars for better breeding parents.

AB Neijiang 977671 and 19 near-isogenic lines with known leaf rust resistance genes were inoculated with 12 pathotypes of Puccinia triticina for postulation of leaf rust resistance genes effective at the seedling stage. The reaction pattern of Neijiang 977671 differed from those of the lines with known leaf rust resistance genes used in the test, indicating that Neijiang 977671 may carry a new leaf rust resistance gene(s). With the objective of identifying and mapping the new gene for resistance to leaf rust, F-1 and F-2 plants, and F-2:3 families, from Neijiang 977671 x Zhengzhou 5389 (susceptible) were inoculated with Chinese P. triticina pathotype FHNQ in the greenhouse. Results from the F-2 and F-2:3 populations indicated that a single dominant gene, temporarily designated LrNJ97, conferred resistance. In order to identify other possible genes in Neijiang 977671 other eight P. triticina pathotypes avirulent on Neijiang 977671 were used to inoculate 25 F-2:3 families. The results showed that at least three leaf rust resistance genes were deduced in Neijiang 977671. Bulked segregant analysis was performed on equal amounts of genomic DNA from 20 resistant and 20 susceptible F-2 plants. SSR markers polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible bulks were used to analyze the F-2:3 families. LrNJ97 was linked to five SSR loci on chromosome 2BL. The two closest flanking SSR loci were Xwmc317 and Xbarc159 at genetic distances of 4.2 and 2.2 cM, respectively. At present two designated genes (Lr50 and Lr58) are located on chromosome 2BL. In the seedling tests, the reaction pattern of LrNJ97 was different from that of Lr50. Lr50 and Lr58 were derived from T. armeniacum and Ae. triuncialis, respectively, whereas according to the pedigree of Neijiang 977671 LrNJ97 is from common wheat. Although seeds of lines with Lr58 were not available, it was concluded that LrNJ97 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene.

AB Preharvest sprouting of wheat results in significant financial loss at all steps in the production and marketing chain. Due to its intermittent nature in many wheat-growing regions, direct selection for tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting is difficult. DNA markers linked to genes conditioning tolerance offer a more consistent and reliable approach to genetic improvement in tolerance. This investigation assessed the value of previously identified markers linked to quantitative trait loci contributing to tolerance, across multiple genetic backgrounds. A significant contribution to tolerance was demonstrated for QPhs.pseru-3AS, previously identified from the hard white winter wheat 'Rio Blanco'. Marker alleles for this locus were associated with enhanced tolerance in three of four investigated populations. In addition, positive contributions of QPhs.pseru-2B1 and QPhs.pseru-2B2 also were documented. Simultaneous selection for putative marker alleles at two independent loci resulted in significantly higher mean tolerance scores. DNA markers linked to loci contributing to variation in preharvest sprouting tolerance offer an efficient and effective alternative to direct phenotypic selection.

AB Diploid wheat, Triticum monococcum L. (einkorn) is an ideal plant material for wheat functional genomics. Brittle culm mutant was identified by screening of the ethyl methane sulphonate-treated M (2) progenies of a T. monococcum accession pau14087 by banding the plant parts manually. The brittle culm mutant with drooping leaves, early flowering, reduced tiller numbers and susceptible to lodging had also exhibited brittleness in all plant parts than the wild-type parents. Comprehensive mechanical strength, histological, biochemical, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses of brittle culm mutant supplemented and complemented the findings that the mutant had defective cellulose biosynthesis pathway and deposition of cell wall materials on secondary cell wall of mechanical tissues. Microscopic studies demonstrated that the decrease in cellulose contents resulted in the irregular cell wall organization in xylem vessels of leaf vascular bundles. To map the brc5 mutant, mapping populations were developed by crossing the brittle culm mutant with wild Triticum boeoticum acc. pau5088, having non-brittle characters. The brittle culm mutation was mapped between SSR markers, Xcfd39 and Xgwm126 on 5A(m)L chromosome of T. monococcum, with genetic distances of 2.6 and 4.8 cM, respectively. The brc5 mutant mapped on 5A(m)L, being distinct from a previously mapped brittle culm mutant in wheat, has been designated as brc5. The work on fine mapping and map-based cloning of brc5 gene regulating synthesis and deposition of cellulose on the secondary cell wall is in progress.

AB Fungal diseases of wheat, including powdery mildew, cause significant crop, yield and quality losses throughout the world. Knowledge of the genetic basis of powdery mildew resistance will greatly support future efforts to develop and cultivate resistant cultivars. Studies were conducted on cultivated emmer-derived wheat line K2 to identify genes involved in powdery mildew resistance at the seedling and adult plant growth stages using a BC1 doubled haploid population derived from a cross between K2 and susceptible cultivar Audace. A single gene was located distal to microsatellite marker Xgwm294 on the long arm of chromosome 2A. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis indicated that the gene was also effective at the adult plant stage, explaining up to 79.0 % of the variation in the progeny. Comparison of genetic maps indicated that the resistance gene in K2 was different from Pm4, the only other formally named resistance gene located on chromosome 2AL, and PmHNK54, a gene derived from Chinese germplasm. The new gene was designated Pm50.

AB Salix viminalis L. (2n = 38) is a diploid dicot species belonging to the Salix genus of the Salicaceae family. This short-rotation woody crop is one of the most important renewable bioenergy resources worldwide. In breeding for high biomass productivity, limited knowledge is available on the molecular cytogenetics of willow, which could be combined with genetic linkage mapping. The present paper describes the adaptation of a fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) protocol as a new approach to analyse the genomic constitution of Salix viminalis using the heterologous DNA clones pSc119.2, pTa71, pTa794, pAs1, Afa-family, pAl1, HT100.3, ZCF1 and the GAA microsatellite marker. Three of the nine probes showed unambiguous signals on the metaphase chromosomes. FISH analysis with the pTa71 probe detected one major 18S-5.8S-26S rDNA locus on the short arm of one chromosome pair; however, the pTa794 rDNA site was not visible. One chromosome pair showed a distinct signal around the centromeric region after FISH with the telomere-specific DNA clone HT100.3. Two chromosome pairs were found to have pAs1 FISH signals, which represent a D-genome-specific insert from Aegilops tauschii. Based on the FISH study, a set of chromosomes with characteristic patterns is presented, which could be used to establish the karyotype of willow species.

AB Grain weight is an important factor contributing to grain yield in wheat. Markers closely linked to grain weight could be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) to accelerate the wheat breeding process. In this paper, a second backcross recombinant inbred line (BC2F4) population, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and one natural population were used to study the relationship between allelic variants of the grain weight gene TaGW2-6A and grain weight, width, and length with the goal of verifying the feasibility using the functional marker Hap-6A-P1/P2 in MAS. The differences in average grain weight, width, and length between haplotypes Hap-6A-G and Hap-6A-A were 8.09 g, 0.22 mm, and 0.38 mm, respectively, in the BC2F4 population; 4.01 g, 0.11 mm, and 0.10 mm in the RIL population; and 3.95 g, 0.10 mm, and 0.20 mm in the natural population. All the differences were significant. Sequencing results of the products of second round PCR indicated that a 167 bp TaqI restriction fragment had been generated from small-grain-size materials because of three TaqI restriction sites (TCGA). However, the large-grain-size variant generated a 218 bp fragment due to a single-nucleotide mutation (SNP) (TCGA -> TCGG) at the third site. TaGW2-6A expression levels were negative with respect to grain width, length, and weight. For this reason, Hap-6A-G was considered a superior allele. These results contradict those of a previous study, which showed Hap-6A-A to be significantly associated with wider grain and higher grain weight.

AB In wheat, the transition from the vegetative to reproductive stage is primarily controlled by the series of vernalisation (Vrn-1) genes located on the homoeologous group 5 chromosomes. Up to 2009, only two alleles at the Vrn-B1 locus were known: one dominant, spring, allele (now designated Vrn-B1a) and the other recessive, winter, (vrn-B1) allele. Recently, two additional dominant alleles, Vrn-B1b and Vrn-B1c, were described. In this study, we screened a range of hexaploid spring wheat germplasms for the presence of different Vrn-B1 alleles using new diagnostic molecular markers. Our results show that the Vrn-B1a allele was the most prevalent, being present in 55.3 % of the 2,495 accessions examined, followed by the recessive vrn-B1 allele, which occurred in 31.5 % of the accessions. The novel alleles Vrn-B1b and Vrn-B1c were found in 5.3 and 7.9 % of all accessions, respectively.

AB The winter wheat lines Luke and AQ24788-83 are respectively susceptible and slow-rusting at tillering stage to yellow (stripe) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). A mapping population consisting of 206 recombinant inbred lines was developed from the cross Luke x AQ24788-83. These lines were evaluated at the tillering stage in the field trials for infection type (IT) and disease incidence (DI) and in greenhouse trials for IT and latent period (LP). A significant negative correlation was found between LP and DI. A genetic map with 473 marker loci was constructed and used for identifying QTL associated with LP and IT. Two QTL, QYr.cau-1BS and QYr.cau-5AS, were mapped on 1BS and 5AS respectively, explaining collectively up to 46.4 % of LP phenotypic variance. QYr.cau-5AS was clearly distinct, in terms of mapping position, from all six yellow rust resistance genes/QTL previously reported on 5A. QYr.cau-1BS could not be spatially differentiated from three (i.e. YrAlp, Yr15, and YrH52) of the six genes/QTL known on 1BS and centromere-vicinity regions, but was determined to be different from these three genes based on phenotype. The two QTL identified here, therefore, are likely to be novel to the currently known Pst resistance genes/QTL. A minor QTL on 3AL was detected to be associated with both IT and LP. Expression of quantitative resistance at early wheat growth stages and usefulness of the QTL are discussed for the wheat-Pst system.

AB Earlier we identified wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome 3A as a major determinant of grain yield and its component traits. In the present study, a high-density genetic linkage map of 81 chromosome 3A-specific markers was developed to increase the precision of previously identified yield component QTLs, and to map QTLs for biomass-related traits. Many of the previously identified QTLs for yield and its component traits were confirmed and were localized to narrower intervals. Four novel QTLs one each for shoot biomass (Xcfa2262-Xbcd366), total biomass (wPt2740-Xcfa2076), kernels/spike (KPS) (Xwmc664-Xbarc67), and Pseudocercosporella induced lodging (PsIL) were also detected. The major QTLs identified for grain yield (GY), KPS, grain volume weight (GVWT) and spikes per square meter (SPSM) respectively explained 23.2%, 24.2%, 20.5% and 20.2% of the phenotypic variation. Comparison of the genetic map with the integrated physical map allowed estimation of recombination frequency in the regions of interest and suggested that QTLs for grain yield detected in the marker intervals Xcdo549-Xbarc310 and Xpsp3047-Xbarc356 reside in the high-recombination regions, thus should be amenable to map-based cloning. On the other hand, QTLs for KPS and SPSM flanked by markers Xwmc664 and Xwmc489 mapped in the low-recombination region thus are not suitable for map-based cloning. Comparisons with the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA sequence identified 11 candidate genes (CGs) for yield and yield related QTLs of which chromosomal location of two (CKX2 and GID2-like) was confirmed using wheat aneuploids. This study provides necessary information to perform high-resolution mapping for map-based cloning and for CG-based cloning of yield QTLs.

AB Background: Betaine (BET) is a component of many foods, including spinach and wheat. It is an essential osmolyte and a source of methyl groups. Recent studies have hypothesized that BET might play a role in athletic performance. However, BET effects on skeletal muscle differentiation and hypertrophy are still poorly understood.
   Methods: We examined BET action on neo myotubes maturation and on differentiation process, using C2C12 murine myoblastic cells. We used RT2-PCR array, Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis to study the BET effects on morphological features of C2C12 and on signaling pathways involved in muscle differentiation and hypertrophy.
   Results: We performed a dose-response study, establishing that 10 mM BET was the dose able to stimulate morphological changes and hypertrophic process in neo myotubes. RT2-PCR array methodology was used to identify the expression profile of genes encoding proteins involved in IGF-1 pathway. A dose of 10 mM BET was found to promote IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1 R) expression. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, performed in neo myotubes, pointed out that 10 mM BET improved IGF-1 signaling, synthesis of Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC) and neo myotubes length. In addition, we investigated BET role on myoblasts proliferation and differentiation. During proliferation, BET did not modify C2C12 proliferative rate, but promoted myogenic induction, enhancing MyoD protein content and cellular elongation. During differentiation, BET caused an increase of muscle-specific markers and IGF-1 R protein levels.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide the first evidence that BET could promote muscle fibers differentiation and increase myotubes size by IGF-1 pathway activation, suggesting that BET might represent a possible new drug/integrator strategy, not only in sport performance but also in clinical conditions characterized by muscle function impairment.

AB Background: Brassica rapa (AA) contains very diverse forms which include oleiferous types and many vegetable types. Genome sequence of B. rapa line Chiifu (ssp. pekinensis), a leafy vegetable type, was published in 2011. Using this knowledge, it is important to develop genomic resources for the oleiferous types of B. rapa. This will allow more involved molecular mapping, in-depth study of molecular mechanisms underlying important agronomic traits and introgression of traits from B. rapa to major oilseed crops - B. juncea (AABB) and B. napus (AACC). The study explores the availability of SNPs in RNA-seq generated contigs of three oleiferous lines of B. rapa - Candle (ssp. oleifera, turnip rape), YSPB-24 and Tetra (ssp. trilocularis, Yellow sarson) and their use in genome-wide linkage mapping and specific-region fine mapping using a RIL population between Chiifu and Tetra.
   Results: RNA-seq was carried out on the RNA isolated from young inflorescences containing unopened floral buds, floral axis and small leaves, using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Sequence assembly was carried out using the Velvet de-novo programme and the assembled contigs were organised against Chiifu gene models, available in the BRAD-CDS database. RNA-seq confirmed the presence of more than 17,000 single-copy gene models described in the BRAD database. The assembled contigs and the BRAD gene models were analyzed for the presence of SSRs and SNPs. While the number of SSRs was limited, more than 0.2 million SNPs were observed between Chiifu and the three oleiferous lines. Assays for SNPs were designed using KASPar technology and tested on a F-7-RIL population derived from a Chiifu x Tetra cross. The design of the SNP assays were based on three considerations - the 50 bp flanking region of the SNPs should be strictly similar, the SNP should have a read-depth of >= 7 and no exon/intron junction should be present within the 101 bp target region. Using these criteria, a total of 640 markers (580 for genome-wide mapping and 60 for specific-region mapping) marking as many genes were tested for mapping. Out of 640 markers that were tested, 594 markers could be mapped unambiguously which included 542 markers for genome-wide mapping and 42 markers for fine mapping of the tet-o locus that is involved with the trait tetralocular ovary in the line Tetra.
   Conclusion: A large number of SNPs and PSVs are present in the transcriptome of B. rapa lines for genome-wide linkage mapping and specific-region fine mapping. Criteria used for SNP identification delivered markers, more than 93% of which could be successfully mapped to the F-7-RIL population of Chiifu x Tetra cross.

AB Background: Sheepgrass [Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel.] is an important perennial forage grass across the Eurasian Steppe and is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions. However, insufficient data resources in public databases for sheepgrass limited our understanding of the mechanism of environmental adaptations, gene discovery and molecular marker development.
   Results: The transcriptome of sheepgrass was sequenced using Roche 454 pyrosequencing technology. We assembled 952,328 high-quality reads into 87,214 unigenes, including 32,416 contigs and 54,798 singletons. There were 15,450 contigs over 500 bp in length. BLAST searches of our database against Swiss-Prot and NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (nr) databases resulted in the annotation of 54,584 (62.6%) of the unigenes. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis assigned 89,129 GO term annotations for 17,463 unigenes. We identified 11,675 core Poaceae-specific and 12,811 putative sheepgrass-specific unigenes by BLAST searches against all plant genome and transcriptome databases. A total of 2,979 specific freezing-responsive unigenes were found from this RNAseq dataset. We identified 3,818 EST-SSRs in 3,597 unigenes, and some SSRs contained unigenes that were also candidates for freezing-response genes. Characterizations of nucleotide repeats and dominant motifs of SSRs in sheepgrass were also performed. Similarity and phylogenetic analysis indicated that sheepgrass is closely related to barley and wheat.
   Conclusions: This research has greatly enriched sheepgrass transcriptome resources. The identified stress-related genes will help us to decipher the genetic basis of the environmental and ecological adaptations of this species and will be used to improve wheat and barley crops through hybridization or genetic transformation. The EST-SSRs reported here will be a valuable resource for future gene-phenotype studies and for the molecular breeding of sheepgrass and other Poaceae species.

AB Background: Ryegrasses and fescues (genera, Lolium and Festuca) are species of forage and turf grasses which are used widely in agricultural and amenity situations. They are classified within the sub-family Pooideae and so are closely related to Brachypodium distachyon, wheat, barley, rye and oats. Recently, a DArT array has been developed which can be used in generating marker and mapping information for ryegrasses and fescues. This represents a potential common marker set for ryegrass and fescue researchers which can be linked through to comparative genomic information for the grasses.
   Results: A F2 perennial ryegrass genetic map was developed consisting of 7 linkage groups defined by 1316 markers and deriving a total map length of 683 cM. The marker set included 866 DArT and 315 gene sequence-based markers. Comparison with previous DArT mapping studies in perennial and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum) identified 87 and 105 DArT markers in common, respectively, of which 94% and 87% mapped to homoeologous linkage groups. A similar comparison with meadow fescue (F. pratensis) identified only 28 DArT markers in common, of which c. 50% mapped to non-homoelogous linkage groups. In L. perenne, the genetic distance spanned by the DArT markers encompassed the majority of the regions that could be described in terms of comparative genomic relationships with rice, Brachypodium distachyon, and Sorghum bicolor.
   Conclusions: DArT markers are likely to be a useful common marker resource for ryegrasses and fescues, though the success in aligning different populations through the mapping of common markers will be influenced by degrees of population interrelatedness. The detailed mapping of DArT and gene-based markers in this study potentially allows comparative relationships to be derived in future mapping populations characterised using solely DArT markers.

AB Common bunt, caused by Tilletia tritici (Bjerk.) G. Wint. in Rabenh. and T. laevis Kuhn in Rabenh., is an economically important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The hexaploid wheat cultivar McKenzie' possesses effective resistance against known races of common bunt in western Canada. Understanding the nature of this resistance through DNA marker mapping will be useful for breeding. Disease reaction to T. tritici race T19 and T. laevis race L16 from field tests was analysed with simple sequence repeat markers for 174 doubled haploid lines using interval mapping. Markers Xgwm573 and Xwmc17, located on wheat chromosome 7B, were strongly associated with the resistance. The quantitative trait locus was designated QCbt.spa-7B.1. The markers were validated on two other populations in which McKenzie' was in the parentage. The markers will be useful in breeding as a tool for selecting for common bunt resistance from McKenzie' and will assist in identifying the resistance among potential new sources.

AB Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass), a diploid wheat relative, is known to be a rich source of disease resistance genes for wheat improvement. To facilitate the transfer of these genes into wheat, information on their chromosomal location is important. A genetic linkage map of Ae. sharonensis was constructed based on 179 F-2 plants derived from a cross between accessions resistant (1644) and susceptible (1193) to wheat leaf rust. The linkage map was based on 389 markers (377 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci) and was comprised of 10 linkage groups, ranging from 2.3 to 124.6 cM. The total genetic length of the map was 818.0 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 3.63 cM. Based on the chromosomal location of 115 markers previously mapped in wheat, the four linkage groups of A, B, C, and E were assigned to Ae. sharonensis (S-sh) and homoeologous wheat chromosomes 6, 1, 3, and 2. The single dominant gene (designated LrAeSh1644) conferring resistance to leaf rust race THBJ in accession 1644 was positioned on linkage group A (chromosome 6S(sh)) and was flanked by DArT markers wpt-9881 (at 1.9 cM distal from the gene) and wpt-6925 (4.5 cM proximal). This study clearly demonstrates the utility of DArT for genotyping uncharacterized species and tagging resistance genes where pertinent genomic information is lacking.

AB Plant disease resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were designed according to the conserved sequence of known RGAs and used to map resistance genes. We used genome-wide RGA markers for genetic analyses of structure and diversity in a global rice germplasm collection. Of the 472 RGA markers, 138 were polymorphic and these were applied to 178 entries selected from the USDA rice core collection. Results from the RGA markers were similar between two methods, UPGMA and STRUCTURE. Additionally, the results from RGA markers in our study were agreeable with those previously reported from SSR markers, including cluster of ancestral classification, genetic diversity estimates, genetic relatedness, and cluster of geographic origins. These results suggest that RGA markers are applicable for analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice. However, unlike SSR markers, the RGA markers failed to differentiate temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and aromatic subgroups. The restricted way for developing RGA markers from the cDNA sequence might limit the polymorphism of RGA markers in the genome, thus limiting the discriminatory power in comparison with SSR markers. Genetic differentiation obtained using RGA markers may be useful for defining genetic diversity of a suite of random R genes in plants, as many studies show a differentiation of resistance to a wide array of pathogens. They could also help to characterize the genetic structure and geographic distribution in crops, including rice, wheat, barley, and banana.

AB Functional markers are needed for key genes involved in drought tolerance to improve selection for crop yield under moisture stress conditions. The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize five drought tolerance candidate genes, namely dehydration responsive element binding 1A (DREB1A), enhanced response to abscisic acid (ERA1-B and ERA1-D), and fructan 1-exohydrolase (1-FEH-A and 1-FEH-B), in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajima's D value, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and (ii) associate within-gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with phenotypic traits in a spring wheat association mapping panel (n = 126). Field trials were grown under contrasting moisture regimes in Greeley, CO, and Melkassa, Ethiopia, in 2010 and 2011. Genome-specific amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the genes identified SNPs and revealed differences in nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajima's D, and patterns of LD. DREB1A showed associations (false discovery rate adjusted probability value = 0.1) with normalized difference vegetation index, heading date, biomass, and spikelet number. Both ERA1-A and ERA1-B were associated with harvest index, flag leaf width, and leaf senescence. 1-FEH-A was associated with grain yield, and 1-FEH-B was associated with thousand kernel weight and test weight. If validated in relevant genetic backgrounds, the identified marker-trait associations may be applied to functional marker-assisted selection.

AB Rye is an important and valuable gene resource for wheat improvement. However, due to extensive growing of cultivars with disease resistance genes from short arm of rye chromosome 1R and coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance, these cultivars successively lost resistance to pathogens. Identification and deployment of new resistance gene sources in rye are, therefore, of especial importance and urgency. A new wheat-rye line, designated as WR41-1, was produced through distant hybridization and chromosome engineering protocols between common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and rye cultivar German White. It was proved to be a new wheat-rye T4BL center dot 4RL and T7AS center dot 4RS translocation line using sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH), and expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) marker analysis. WR41-1 showed high levels of resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) pathogens prevalent in China at the adult growth stage and 13 of 23 Bgt isolates tested at the seedling stage. According to its resistant pattern to 23 different Bgt isolates, WR41-1 may possess new gene(s) for resistance to powdery mildew, which differed from previously identified and known powdery mildew genes from rye (Pm7, Pm8, Pm17, and Pm20). In addition, WR41-1 was cytologically stable, had a desirable fertility, and is expected to be useful in wheat improvement.

AB The emergence of new sequencing technologies has provided fast and cost-efficient strategies for high-resolution mapping of complex genomes. Although these approaches hold great promise to accelerate genome analysis, their application in studying genetic variation in wheat has been hindered by the complexity of its polyploid genome. Here, we applied the next-generation sequencing of a wheat doubled-haploid mapping population for high-resolution gene mapping and tested its utility for ordering shotgun sequence contigs of a flow-sorted wheat chromosome. A bioinformatical pipeline was developed for reliable variant analysis of sequence data generated for polyploid wheat mapping populations. The results of variant mapping were consistent with the results obtained using the wheat 9000 SNP iSelect assay. A reference map of the wheat genome integrating 2740 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the wheat iSelect assay, 1351 diversity array technology, 118 simple sequence repeat/sequence-tagged sites, and 416,856 genotyping-by-sequencing markers was developed. By analyzing the sequenced megabase-size regions of the wheat genome we showed that mapped markers are located within 40-100 kb from genes providing a possibility for high-resolution mapping at the level of a single gene. In our population, gene loci controlling a seed color phenotype cosegregated with 2459 markers including one that was located within the red seed color gene. We demonstrate that the high-density reference map presented here is a useful resource for gene mapping and linking physical and genetic maps of the wheat genome.

AB Chapio is a spring wheat developed by CIMMYT in Mexico by a breeding program that focused on multigenic resistances to leaf rust and stripe rust. A population consisting of 277 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed by crossing Chapio with Avocet. The RILs were genotyped with DArT markers (137 randomly selected RILs) and bulked segregant analysis conducted to supplement the map with informative SSR markers. The final map consisted of 264 markers. Phenotyping against stripe rust was conducted for three seasons in Toluca, Mexico and at three sites over two seasons (total of four environments) in Sichuan Province, China. Significant loci across the two inter-continental regions included Lr34/Yr18 on 7DS, Sr2/Yr30 on 3BS, and a QTL on 3D. There were significant genotype x environment interactions with resistance gene Yr31 on 2BS being effective in most of the Toluca environments; however, a late incursion of a virulent pathotype in 2009 rendered this gene ineffective. This locus also had no effect in China. Conversely, a 5BL locus was only effective in the Chinese environments. There were also complex additive interactions. In the Mexican environments, Yr31 suppressed the additive effect of Yr30 and the 3D locus, but not of Lr34/Yr18, while in China, the 3D and 5BL loci were generally not additive with each other, but were additive when combined with other loci. These results indicate the importance of maintaining diverse, multi-genic resistances as Chapio had stable inter-continental resistance despite the fact that there were QTLs that were not effective in either one or the other region.

AB Modern sugarcane cultivars are highly polyploid and aneuploid hybrids, which are propagated as clones. Their complex genome structure comprises 100-130 chromosomes and 10-13 hom(e)ologous copies of most loci. There is preliminary evidence of very high heterozygosity, with implications for genetic improvement approaches ranging from marker-assisted selection to transgenics. Here, we report that sugarcane cultivar Q200 has at least nine alleles at the Loading Stem Gene (ScLSG) locus. Exon-intron structure is identical and the predicted protein products show at least 92 % identity, across sugarcane alleles and the Sorghum homologue Sb07g027880. There is substantial variation in the 5' UTR and promoter regions including numerous allele-specific nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions. We developed an allele-specific qRT-PCR method to undertake the first compelling test of allele-specific expression in polyploid sugarcane. Seven alleles distinguished by this method all showed peak expression in the sucrose-loading zone of the stem, but there was apparent variability in expression patterns across other tissues. The ScLSG2 and ScLSG5 alleles appear promising for specificity of expression in stems, relative to leaf, meristem, emerging shoot and root tissues. Within the stem, there was activity in parenchyma, vascular and rind tissues. This expression pattern is of interest in basic research and biotechnology aimed at enhanced sucrose content, engineering value-added products, and manipulation of stem biomass composition.

AB Wheat landraces provide a source of genetic variability for breeding. The emergence and spread of highly virulent races of the stem rust pathogen (Ug99 race group of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) threaten wheat production globally. Spring wheat landraces were screened for resistance in eight field seasons at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Njoro, where the Ug99 race group has become endemic. Accessions showing resistance in one season were retested and screened with molecular markers associated with resistance genes Sr2, ST24, Sr36, and Lr34/Yr18; two height-reducing genes; and a photoperiod insensitivity allele. Of 2,509 accessions tested, 278 were categorized as resistant based on results from at least two seasons. Of these resistant accessions, 32 were positive for one or more markers for Sr2, Sr36, Rht-B1b, or Rht-D1b, indicating that they do not fit the definition of "landrace" because these genes were likely introduced via modern breeding practices. Thus, 246 resistant "landrace" accessions were identified. Of countries with more than five tested accessions, Afghanistan, Iran, Portugal, Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Greece, Tajikistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia had at least 10% of tested accessions that were resistant to the Ug99 race group. Future research will characterize the resistance to determine its novelty and incorporate novel genes into improved lines.

AB Temperature-sensitive resistance (TSR) that can protect against losses to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) has been described in elite wheat germplasm. A TSR identified in the advanced breeding line CO960333 and its derivative KS06HW79 was examined in growthchamber tests conducted under constant temperature regimes of 18, 21, and 24 C against an array of WSMV isolates. At 18 degrees C, all tested isolates systemically infected the pedigree parents, while the progeny line CO960333 remained free of symptoms; at 24 degrees C, all lines were susceptible. At the intermediate temperature of 21 degrees C, the TSR of KS06HW79 was effective in contrast to the TSRs of KS03HW12 and 'RonL'. In field trials conducted in 2011 and 2012, the TSR expressed in KS06HW79 conferred complete protection against yield losses from inoculation with the Sidney 81 isolate of WSMV, while the TSR of RonL conferred similar protection in 2012 but allowed small losses in 2011. The resistance expressed by KS06HW79 is likely not due to the Wsm1 gene because it did not contain the tightly linked J15 sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) DNA marker. These findings suggest that KS06HW79 could be an additional TSR source of value to wheat-breeding programs seeking to control losses from WSMV.

AB Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the major constraints for wheat production in acidic soils worldwide and use of Al-tolerant cultivars is one of the most effective approaches to reduce Al damage in the acidic soils. A Chinese landrace, FSW, shows a high level of tolerance to Al toxicity and a mapping population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between FSW and Al-sensitive US spring wheat cultivar Wheaton to validate the quantitative trait loci (QTL) previously identified in FSW. The mapping population was evaluated for net root growth (NRG) during Al stress in a nutrient solution culture and hematoxylin staining score (HSS) of root tips after Al stress. After 132 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from three chromosomes that were previously reported to have the QTLs were analyzed in the population, two QTLs for Al tolerance from FSW were confirmed. The major QTL on chromosome 4DL co-segregated with the Al-activated malate transporter gene (ALMT1), however, sequence analysis of the promoter region (Ups4) of ALMT1 gene indicated that FSW contained a marker allele that is different from the one that was reported to condition Al tolerance in the Brazilian source. Another QTL on chromosome 3BL showed a minor effect on Al tolerance in the population. The two QTLs accounted for about 74.9 % of the phenotypic variation for HSS and 72.1 % for NRG and demonstrated an epistatic effect for both HSS and NRG. SSR markers closely linked to the QTLs have potential to be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to improve Al tolerance in wheat breeding programs.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) disease associated with yield and quality losses and mycotoxin grain contamination. Host plant resistance is the most economical and efficient way of control. However, novel sources of resistance are required. The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for type II resistance against FHB in the spring wheat cultivar Catbird, released by CIMMYT, and to find low cost molecular markers linked to these QTL. A population of 102 doubled haploid lines derived from the cross between Catbird and Milan (a FHB-susceptible cultivar) was genotyped with 209 microsatellite markers and assessed by single floret inoculation in a greenhouse during 2007, 2008, and 2011. One significant QTL, named QFhs.inta-7D, was detected on chromosome 7DS. Additionally, two minor and unstable QTL were also detected on chromosomes 3BS and 5DL. Favorable alleles for all three QTL were derived from Catbird. QFhs.inta-7D peaked at simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker cfd14, flanked by markers barc128 and wmc702, and explained, on average, 20% of the phenotypic variation. The chromosomal region associated with FHB resistance in this work represents an interesting source of type II resistance and adds diversity to the FHB resistance gene pool. Stacking QFhs.inta-7D with other QTL may achieve more acceptable levels of FHB resistance in new commercial cultivars. Once validated, markers linked to QFhs.inta-7D could be used in marker-assisted selection programs.

AB Libraries of large chromosome segment introgressions from wild relatives to crop species are valuable for assigning genes to specific chromosome segments and for interspecific transfers of useful genes. Using chromosome engineering, two sets of introgression lines (ILs) were created from chromosome segments of wild emmer [Triticum turgidum L. subsp. dicoccoides (Korn. ex Asch. & Graebn.) Thell. (TDIC)] in two cultivars of bread what (Triticum aestivum L.) by backcrosses to ditelocentrics. Segment identities were confirmed, and genetic lengths of segments and map positions of the translocation breakpoints were determined using 277 simple sequence repeat markers polymorphic between the recipients (bread wheat) and the wild donor (TDIC). The identities of all targeted chromosome arms in individual introgressions were confirmed. In addition, most lines also carried introgressed segments on nontargeted arms, most often the proximal parts of arms opposite to the targeted ones, which is consistent with the distribution of crossing over in wheat and are unavoidable when alien chromatin is introgressed by backcrosses to telocentrics. Using these ILs, some loci controlling important quantitative traits were located on specific TDIC chromosomes, such as loci with positive effects on thousand kernel weight (TKW) on chromosome arms 6AS, 4BS, 1BS, and 7A. These results indicate that these ILs might be a useful germplasm in allocating genes to chromosome arms and in wheat breeding.

TI Molecular Markers for Leaf Rust Resistance Gene Lr42 in Wheat

DT Article
ID F-SP TRITICI; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; GERMPLASM; TAUSCHII; SYSTEM; MAP
AB Wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., is an important wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) foliar disease worldwide. Growing cultivars incorporating genetic resistance is one of the most effective approaches for disease control. Leaf rust resistance gene Lr42 was identified from a wheat relative, Aegilops tauschii Coss. (goatgrass), and has been transferred into hard winter wheat. A previous study identified two markers closely linked to the gene on the short arm of chromosome 1D (1DS) using a near-isogenic population, but flanking markers for Lr42 were not found. In this study, a new mapping population was developed from a cross between 'KS93U50' (a Lr42 carrier) and a susceptible parent, 'Morocco'. An F-2 population was analyzed with all simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers available from chromosome 1D and F-2 plants and F-3 families were evaluated for seedling resistance to isolate PNMRJ, a rust isolate avirulent to Lr42. The F-2 and F-3 rust data showed that Lr42 was recessive. Seven markers formed the linkage group on chromosome 1DS. The Lr42 region was flanked by two SSR markers, Xwmc432 and Xgdm33, at 18 cM apart. The results confirmed that Lr42 is positioned on the distal end of chromosome 1DS. The flanking markers for Lr42 should be useful for map-based cloning and marker-assisted pyramiding of Lr42 with other leaf rust resistance genes.

AB Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are a rich source of SSR sequences, but the proportion of long Class I microsatellites with many repeats vs. short Class II microsatellites with few repeats is an important factor to consider. Class I microsatellites, with more than 20bp of repeats, tend to make better markers with higher polymorphism. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of Class I and Class II microsatellites in a collection of over 21000 ESTs from a single study of five different tissues of common bean: two types of leaves, nodules, pods and roots. For this objective, we used three different bioinformatics pipelines: Automated Microsatellite Marker Development (AMMD), Batchprimer3 and SSRLocator. In addition, we determined the frequency of single or multiple SSRs in the assembled ESTs, the frequency of perfect and compound repeats and whether Class I microsatellites were mainly di-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide motifs with each of the search engines. Primers were designed for a total of 175 microsatellites concentrating on class I microsatellites identified with SSR locator. A few other microsatellites were included from the other search engines, AMMD and Batchprimer3 programs so as to have a representative set of class II markers for comparison sake. The comparison of 95 class I vs. 80 class II markers confirmed that the Class I were more polymorphic and therefore more useful.

AB A quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) marker Ta0 with hydrolysis probe ("TaqMan"), targeted to the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA, has been developed for quantification of summer truffle (Tuber aestivum) mycelium. Gene copy concentrations determined by the qPCR were calibrated against pure culture mycelium of T. aestivum, enabling quantification of the mycelium in soil and in host roots from the fields. Significant concentrations of the fungus were observed not only in the finest roots with ectomycorrhizae but also in other root types, indicating that the fungus is an important component of the microbial film at the root surface. The concentration of T. aestivum in soil is relatively high compared to other ectomycorrhizal fungi. To evaluate the reliability of the measurement of the soil mycelium density using qPCR, the steady basal extracellular concentration of the stabilized T. aestivum DNA should be known and taken into account. Therefore, we addressed the stability of the qPCR signal in soil subjected to different treatments. After the field soil was sieved, regardless of whether it was dried/rewetted or not, the T. aestivum DNA was quickly decomposed. It took just about 4 days to reach a steady concentration. This represents a conserved pool of T. aestivum DNA and determines detection limit of the qPCR quantification in our case. When the soil was autoclaved and recolonized by saprotrophic microorganisms, this conserved DNA pool was eliminated and the soil became free of T. aestivum DNA.

AB Two hundred sixteen barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars were selected to represent the diversity and history of European spring two-row barley breeding and to search for alleles controlling agronomic traits by association genetics. The germplasm was genotyped with 7864 gene-based single nucleotide polymorphism markers and corresponding field trial trait data relating to growth and straw strength were obtained at multiple European sites. Analysis of the marker data by statistical population genetics approaches revealed two important trends in the genetic diversity of European two-row spring barley, namely, i) directional selection for approximately 14% of total genetic variation of the population in the last approximately 50 yr and ii) highly uneven genomic distribution of genetic diversity. Association analysis of the phenotypic and genotypic data identified multiple loci affecting the traits investigated, some of which co-map with selected regions. Collectively, these data show that the genetic makeup of European two-row spring barley is evolving under breeder selection, with signs of extinction of diversity in some genomic regions, suggesting that "breeding the best with the best" is leading towards fixation of some breeder targets. Nevertheless, modern germplasm also retains many regions of high diversity, suggesting that site-specific genetic approaches for allele identification and crop improvement such as association genetics are likely to be successful.

AB Barley is an important crop used widely in Europe for food production, feed and malting. Unfortunately it is often colonised by fungi from the Fusarium genus. Fusarium culmorum is a global pathogen causing root rot and crown rot in small-grain cereals, resulting in a reduction in yield and grain quality. F. culmorum produces the highly toxic chemicals trichothecenes. Experimental
   Chemotypes and mating-type idiomorphs (MAT) were identified using Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) and genetic diversity was determined using Sequence-related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Physiological features such as mycelium growth rate were also evaluated.
   As many as 94% of isolates was classified as a 3ADON producing and only two isolates displayed NIV chemotype. The average growth rate at 15A degrees C and 25A degrees C equalled 5.32 mm/day and 13.5 mm/day, respectively. The MAT idiomorph amplification revealed that 60% of isolates possessed MAT1-2 idiomorph. Among 32 obtained SRAP and RAPD markers, eight were associated with mycelium growth rate.
   It was shown first time that F. culmorum isolates with MAT1-2 idiomorph in the genome grew slower than these with MAT1-1. High level of genetic variability was determined based on amplification of SRAP and RAPD markers.

   TRANSCRIPT ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR MARKERS; HETEROSIS
AB In spite of commercial use of heterosis in agriculture, the molecular basis of heterosis is poorly understood. It was observed that maize hybrid Zong3/87-1 exhibited an earlier onset or heterosis in radicle emergence. To get insights into the underlying mechanism of heterosis in radicle emergence, differential proteomic analysis between hybrid and its parental lines was performed. In total, the number of differentially expressed protein spots between hybrid and its parental lines in dry and 24 h imbibed seed embryos were 134 and 191, respectively, among which 47.01% (63/134) and 34.55% (66/191) protein spots displayed nonadditively expressed pattern. Remarkably, 54.55% of nonadditively accumulated proteins in 24 h imbibed seed embryos displayed above or equal to the level of the higher parent patterns. Moreover, 155 differentially expressed protein spots were identified, which were grouped into eight functional classes, including transcription & translation, energy & metabolism, signal transduction, disease & defense, storage protein, transposable element, cell growth & division and unclassified proteins. In addition, one of the upregulated proteins in F-1 hybrids was ZmACT2, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana ACT7 (AtACT7). Expressing ZmACT2 driven by the AtACT7 promoter partially complemented the low germination phenotype in the Atact7 mutant. These results indicated that hybridization between two parental lines can cause changes in the expression of a variety of proteins, and it is concluded that the altered pattern of gene expression at translational level in the hybrid may be responsible for the observed heterosis.

AB Thinopyrum elongatum is an important relative of wheat, it is favored by many researchers for the disease resistant genes that exist in its E genome. Some studies have showed that the 7E chromosome of Th. elongatum contains resistance genes related to Fusarium head blight and wheat rust. Therefore, developing 7E chromosome-specific molecular markers linked to resistance genes will provide an important tool for exploring and using the resistant genes of Th. elongatum. In addition, it would greatly contribute in the effort to cultivate disease-resistant wheat varieties. Featured in high throughput, high-accuracy and low-cost, SLAF-seq technology has been widely used in molecular breeding, system evolution, and germplasm resource detection. Based on SLAF-seq, 518 specific fragments on the 7E chromosome of Th. elongatum were successfully amplified. A total of 135 primers were designed according to 135 randomly selected fragments, and 89 specific molecular markers of Th. elongatum were developed, with efficiencies up to 65.9%. These markers were all detected in a variety of materials, and they are all proved to be specific and stable. These markers can be used not only for detecting the 7E chromosome of Th. elongatum but also for providing an important theoretical and practical basis for wheat breeding by marker-assisted selection (MAS). This paper reports the first application of SLAF-seq technology with a high success rate in developing specific molecular markers for Th. elongatum, providing a strong case for the application of this new technology.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola, is one of the most destructive foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) especially in temperate and humid regions across the world. The susceptibility of recently released varieties, evolution of resistance to fungicides and increasing incidence of STB disease emphasizes the need to understand the genetics of resistance to this disease and to incorporate host resistance into adapted cultivars. This study aimed to decipher the genetics and map the resistance to STB using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from 'Steele-ND' (susceptible parent) and 'ND 735' (resistant parent). The RILs were evaluated in three greenhouse experiments, using a North Dakota (ND) isolate of STB pathogen. The mean disease severity of parental genotypes, 'ND 735' (11.96%) and 'Steele-ND' (66.67%) showed significant differences (p < 0.05). The population segregated for STB and the frequency distribution of RILs indicated quantitative inheritance for resistance. The mean disease severity in RILs ranged from 0 to 71.55% with a mean of 21.98%. The genome map of this population was developed using diversity array technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The framework linkage map of this population was developed using 469 molecular markers. This map spanned a total distance of 1,789.3 cM and consisted of 17 linkage groups. QTL mapping using phenotypic data and the framework linkage maps detected three QTL through composite interval mapping. One QTL was consistently detected in all experiments on the long arm of chromosome 5B, and explained up to 10.2% phenotypic variation. The other two QTLs, detected in single environments, were mapped to 1D and 7A and explain 13% and 5.5% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. The map position of the consistent QTL on 5BL coincides with the map position of durable resistance gene Stb1 suggesting the importance of this region of 'ND 735' as a source of durable STB resistance for the wheat germplasm.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, was one of the most disaster foliar diseases for wheat-growing areas of the world. Thinopyrum intermedium has provided novel resistance genes to multi-fungal disease, and new wheat-Th. intermedium derivatives for stripe rust resistance still need to develop for wheat breeding. Wheat line X484-3 was selected from a cross between wheat line MY11 and wheat-Th. intermedium ssp. trichophorum partial amphiploid TE-1508, and was characterized by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and functional molecular markers. Chromosome counting revealed that the X484-3 was 2n = 44 and GISH analysis using Pseudoroegneria spicata genomic DNAas a probe demonstrated that X484-3 contained a pair of St-chromosomes from Th. intermedium donor parents. The functional molecular markers confirmed that introduced St-chromosomes belonging to linkage group 7, indicating that line X484-3 was a 7St addition line. The resistance observation displayed that the introduced Th. intermedium ssp. trichophorum derived chromosomes 7St were responsible for the stripe rust resistances at adult plant. The identified wheat-Th. intermedium chromosome 7St addition line X484-3 can be used as a donor in wheat breeding for stripe rust resistance.

AB The 4H(4D) wheat/barley substitution line was crossed with the 'Chinese Spring' ph1b mutant genotype in order to induce wheat-barley homoeologous recombinations. F-3 and F-4 seeds of the 4H(4D) x 'Chinese Spring' ph1b mutant cross were analysed using genomic in situ hybridization, and a Robertsonian translocation was detected in monosomic form. Disomic centric fusions were selected among the self-fertilized progenies. The presence of the long arm of 4H was confirmed with SSR markers. The long arm of the 5D wheat chromosome in the Robertsonian translocation was identified using fluorescent in situ hybridization with the help of three DNA probes: pSc119.2, Afa family and pTa71. The wheat/barley centric fusion was identified as a 4HL.5DL translocation. This line exhibited supernumerary spikelet character, but the number of seeds/plant did not increase. The 4HL.5DL centric fusion line is suitable genetic material to study the expression of genes located on 4HL in a wheat genetic background.

AB Aim. The introgression of the short arm of rye chromosome-1 (1RS) in bread wheat is one of the most frequently used alien introgression in wheat programs throughout the world for wheat improvement against biotic and abiotic stresses. At current state of knowledge, it is not known as to which extent the rye chromatin might exist in Pakistani wheat germplasm. Current study was aimed to identify wheat-rye translocations (1AL. 1RS and 1BL. 1RS) in Pakistani wheat germplasm and to correlate the yield potential and other useful traits with this translocation.
   Methods. Thirty different Pakistani wheat varieties were grown and data on various morphological traits were collected and subsequently subjected to statistical analysis. DNA was extracted from all the tested and control varieties and was subjected to PCR amplification with molecular markers namely RIS for detection of rye translocations.
   Results. Significant differences were found in control and tested varieties for important traits such as yield, 1000 kernel weight, flag leaf length and spike length. However differences were not significant for traits like dry biomass, tillering, and harvest index. Moreover a significant positive correlation was observed between plant height and 1000 kernel weight, flag leaf diameter and spike length, 1000 kernel weight and yield and between flag leaf diameter and yield. In order to detect rye chromatin in Pakistani wheat, wheat-rye translocated segments were successfully amplified, with primers specific for Rye Interspersed Sequence, in 23 varieties out of total 30 tested in this study.
   Conclusion. This information will be very important for future improvement of Pakistani wheat germplasm for higher yield and other quality traits.

AB Six novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) from Aegilops speltoides (SS, 2n=2x=14) and Aegilops kotschyi (UUSS, 2n=4x=28) were identified by SDS-PAGE and designated as ASy15*, AKx1*, AKx3*, AKx2.3, AKy20* and AKy8*, respectively. Their complete open reading frames (ORFs) were cloned and sequenced by allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). Sequence comparison demonstrated that these novel genes displayed high single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and InDel variations. In particular, AKy8* had an extra cysteine residue at position 140 in the central repetitive domain, while AKx2.3 had an unusually long repetitive domain (816 aa), which might have positive effects on gluten quality. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AKx1* and AKx3* belonged to the 1S genome, AKx2.3 to the 1U genome, and AKy20* and AKy8* most likely to the 1S genome. The divergence between the 6 HMW-GS genes from the two Aegilops species and those from Triticum species occurred 4.77-23.54 MYA. The authenticity of these isolated endogenous HMW-GS genes was confirmed through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and Western blotting.

AB Development of effective molecular markers linked to Pm21 deriving from Haynaldia villosa is critical for wheat breeding of powdery mildew resistance. In this study, we designed 12 pairs of conserved-intron scanning primers (CISPs), using intron-containing conserved genes located on the short arm of Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 3 (3BdS) aligned with cDNA or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of Triticeae crops. Of 12 CISP primer pairs, 11 amplified DNA both in H.villosa and in wheat, and four displayed H.villosa chromosome 6VS-specific polymorphisms. Six non-polymorphic DNAs were further sequenced for designing internal primers, and five additional 6VS-specific markers were obtained. Of the total nine 6VS-specific co-dominant markers, six could effectively trace Pm21 in F2 population derived from the hybrid between the T6AL.6VS line and Yangmai 158'. This study demonstrated that Brachypodium genomic information could be powerfully utilized to develop molecular markers in H.villosa or other Triticeae species.

AB A loss of granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSS I) activity results in starch granules that contain mostly amylopectin and little or no amylose, a phenotype described as waxy. Previously, two phenotypic classes of waxy alleles, wxa, associated with no detectable GBSS I, and wxb, associated with apparently inactive GBSS I in the endosperm, were reported in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). In this study, the waxy alleles in a sorghum core collection were investigated using DNA markers. Of the 337 sorghum accessions examined, 17 accessions that were confirmed to be waxy by a negative iodine staining result and 16 were found to be wxa. A novel waxy allele, wxc, was found in a Taiwanese landrace. This allele consists of a +1G to C mutation in the 5 splice site at the intron 10-exon 11 boundary, a mutation that most likely resulted in the suppression of GBSS I gene expression. A DNA marker specific for wxc was produced to distinguish the wxc allele from other alleles, allowing the identification of heterozygous non-waxy plants.

AB Worldwide, salinity is a major environmental stress affecting agricultural production. Sodium (Na+) exclusion has long been recognised as a mechanism of salinity tolerance (ST) in cereals and several molecular markers have been suggested for breeding. However, there have been no empirical studies to show that selection for Na+ exclusion markers could improve grain yield in bread wheat under dryland salinity. In six field trials, a bread wheat mapping population was grown to validate Na+ exclusion quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified earlier in hydroponics, to determine the impact of Na+ exclusion on grain yield, and to identify QTL for yield-related traits. The traits included grain yield, grain number per m(2), 1,000-grain weight, maturity, plant height, and leaf Na+ and K+ concentrations. The presence of numerous QTL with minor effects for most traits indicated the genetic complexity of these traits, and thus limited prospects for pyramiding at present. Considerable QTL-by-environment interactions were observed, with the stable QTL generally being co-located with maturity or early vigour/height genes, which demonstrates the importance of measuring major agronomic traits in order to discover genuine QTL for ST. Several QTL for seedling biomass and Na+ exclusion identified earlier in hydroponics were also detected in field trials but with marginal impact on grain yield. These results suggest that selection for Na+ exclusion and the use of hydroponics-based seedling assays may not necessarily result in improved ST. However, as this is the first report of its kind, there is an urgent need for testing other mapping populations in realistic environments to discover novel ST-QTL for breeding programs. In the meantime, grain yield QTL independent of maturity and height may offer potential to improve ST.

AB Acid soil/aluminium toxicity is one of the major constraints on barley production around the world. Genetic improvement is the best solution and molecular-marker-assisted selection has proved to be an efficient tool for developing barley cultivars with acid soil/aluminium tolerance. In this study, barley variety Svanhals-introduced from CYMMIT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center)-was identified as acid soil/aluminium tolerant and the tolerance was mapped to chromosome 4H in 119 doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross of Hamelin/Svanhals. The HvMATE gene, encoding an aluminium-activated citrate transporter, was selected as a candidate gene and gene-specific molecular markers were developed to detect acid soil/aluminium tolerance based on the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the HvMATE gene identified a 21-bp indel (insertion-deletion) between the tolerant and sensitive cultivars. The new marker was further mapped to the QTL (quantitative trait loci) region on chromosome 4H for acid soil tolerance and accounted for 66.9 % of phenotypic variation in the DH population. Furthermore, the polymorphism was confirmed in other tolerant varieties which have been widely used as a source of acid soil tolerance in Australian barley breeding programs. The new gene-specific molecular marker provides an effective and simple molecular tool for selecting the acid soil tolerance gene from multiple tolerance sources.

AB Relatively little is known of the genetic control of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) and pigment traits important in determining efficiency of photosynthesis in wheat and its association with biomass productivity. A doubled haploid population of 94 lines from the wheat cross Chinese Spring x SQ1 was trialled under optimum glasshouse conditions for 4 years to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for CF traits including, for the first time in wheat, JIP-test parameters per excited cross section (CSm): ABS/CSm, DIo/CSm, TRo/CSm, RC/CSm and ETo/CSm, key parameters determining efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus, as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid contents to establish associations with biomass and grain yield. The existing genetic map was extended to 920 loci by adding Diversity Arrays Technology markers. Markers and selected genes for photosynthetic light reactions, pigment metabolism and biomass accumulation were located to chromosome deletion bins. Across all CF traits and years, 116 QTL for CF were located on all chromosomes except 7B, and 39 QTL were identified for pigments on the majority of chromosomes, excluding 1A, 2A, 4A, 3B, 5B, 1D, 2D, 5D, 6D and 7D. Thirty QTL for plant productivity traits were mapped on chromosomes 3A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 1B, 2B, 4B, 6B, 7B, 3D and 4D. A region on chromosome 6B was identified where 14 QTL for CF parameters coincided with QTL for chlorophyll content and grain weight per ear. Thirty-five QTL regions were coincident with candidate genes. The environment was shown to dominate in determining expression of genes for those traits.

AB Miscanthus sinensis (M. sinensis) is a perennial C-4 photosynthesis grass, with high yield, high efficiency of water usage, low fertilizer requirement, tolerance to extreme environments, and is one of the plant species with good biofuel potential. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are highly informative and widely used in plant genetic studies. In this study, 88 SSR primer pairs derived from the rice genome, including 47 EST-SSRs (eSSRs) and 41 genomic SSRs (gSSRs), were evaluated for cross-species transferability to M. sinensis. Forty-one SSR primer pairs in total could successfully amplify DNA fragments in M. sinensis, showing an overall transferability rate of 46.6 % between rice and M. sinensis. The transferability rate of eSSR (51.1 %) was higher than that of gSSR (41.5 %). A total of 140 SSR loci and 340 alleles in the set of rice and M. sinensis germplasm collections were detected. Nei's gene diversity varied from 0 to 0.72 and averaged 0.35. Shannon's information index varied from 0 to 1.49 and averaged 0.56. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0 to 0.95 and averaged 0.08. Thirty-nine loci (27.86 %) were shown heterozygosity out of 140 SSR loci. A dendrogram based on genetic distance showed a significant geographic differentiation. Our results indicated that 46.6% of the rice SSR markers are transferable to M. sinensis, and are useful for germplasm evaluation and genetic analysis in M. sinensis.

AB Drought stress has a considerable impact on the ecosystem and agriculture. Continuous water deficit induces early leaf senescence in plants. During this process, chloroplasts are degraded and photosynthesis drastically drops. The objective of this investigation was to look into the regulation of nitrogen and carbon metabolism during water deficit. Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; EC 4.1.1.39) and the total protein contents inform us of the sink-source relation in plants. Glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2) isoenzymes are good markers of plastid status (GS2) and the nitrogen metabolism (GS1).
   Tolerant and sensitive wheat (Triticum aestivum L) genotypes were tested, which are widely used in agriculture. The amount of protein, Rubisco and GS isoforms in leaves were measured during the grain filling period, as indicative traits that ultimately determine the onset and stage of senescence. The symptoms of senescence first appeared on the oldest and finally on the youngest leaves. Drought stress disrupted the sequentiality of senescence in the sensitive varieties. An untimely senescence appeared in flag leaves, earlier than in the older leaves. Total protein and Rubisco contents decreased and the GS2 isoenzyme declined considerably in the youngest leaves. In the tolerant varieties, however, these physiological parameters did not change under drought, only the sequential senescence of leaf levels accelerated in some cases compared to the control, well-watered plants. Our results revealed that GS is a good indicator of drought stress, which can be applied for the characterization of wheat cultivars in terms of drought stress tolerance.

AB TaSAP1, a member of the stress association protein (SAP) gene family from wheat, is involved in response to several abiotic stresses, including drought, salt and cold. In this study, TaSAP1-A1, a TaSAP1 member on chromosome 7A, and its flanking sequences were isolated. Polymorphism analysis indicated that the average nucleotide diversity (pi) of the whole region was 0.00296. The highest nucleotide diversity occurred in the promoter region (pi = 0.00631) and no polymorphism was identified in the coding region. Three markers T7AM5, T7AM2606 and T7AM39 located in the promoter region, were developed from sequence variations (InDel5-1810, SNP-2606 and InDel39-1637). Six haplotypes were identified among 300 accessions based on the three markers. TaSAP1-A1 was located on chromosome 7A using marker T7AM39 and was flanked by markers Xwmc530 and Xbarc174. QTL for yield-related traits, including 1,000-grain weight, number of grains per spike and grain yield, were located in the same region. In marker- and haplotype-trait association analyses, TaSAP1-A1 was significantly associated with 1,000-grain weight, number of grains per spike, spike length, peduncle length and total number of spikelets per spike in multiple environments. These results provide useful information for marker-assisted selection for yield-related traits under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions.

AB Stripe rust resistance in the winter wheat cultivar Claire had remained effective in the UK and Europe since its release in 1999 and consequently has been used extensively in wheat breeding programs. However, in 2012, reports indicated that this valuable resistance may now have been compromised. To characterise stripe rust resistance in Claire and determine which genes may still confer effective resistance a cross was made between Claire and the stripe rust susceptible cultivar Lemhi. A genetic linkage map, constructed using SSR, AFLP, DArT and NBS-AFLP markers had a total map length of 1,730 cM. To improve the definition of two quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified on the long arm of chromosome 2D further markers were developed from wheat EST. Stripe rust resistance was evaluated on adult plants under field and glasshouse conditions by measuring the extent of fungal growth and sporulation, percentage infection (Pi) and the necrotic/chlorotic responses of the plant to infection, infection type (IT). Four QTL contributing to stripe rust adult plant resistance (APR) were identified in Claire, QYr.niab-2D.1, QYr.niab-2D.2, QYr.niab-2B and QYr.niab-7B. For Pi QYr.niab-2D.1 explained up to 25.4 % of the phenotypic variation, QYr.niab-2D.2 up to 28.7 %, QYr.niab-2B up to 21.7 % and QYr.niab-7B up to 13.0 %. For IT the percentages of phenotypic variation explained were 23.4, 31.8, 17.2 and 12.6 %, respectively. In addition to the four QTL conferring APR in Claire, a race-specific, seedling expressed resistance gene was identified on chromosome 3B.

AB Miscanthus sinensis, a C-4 perennial grass, is widely distributed in most parts of China. M. sinensis has been selected as a candidate for bioenergy resources, owing to its high biomass potential and good adaptability on marginal lands. In this study, we detected the genetic diversity in wild populations of M. sinensis in southwest China. The results showed the percentage of polymorphic bands is 93.2%, the average Nei's gene diversity in population was 0.3870 and mean Shannon index was 0.5589. The mean of total gene diversity (H-T) was 0.3831 +/- 0.0216, while the allelic diversity within populations (H-S) and among populations (D-ST) was 0.3127 +/- 0.0161 and 0.0704, respectively. The genetic differentiation coefficient (G(ST)) was 0,1838, and the gene flow (N-m) was 1.110. The wild populations of M. sinensis have high genetic diversity within each population than among populations. As M. sinensis has a large phenotypic variation in many traits that are important for biomass yield, the best yielding genotypes could be bred into hybrids with low input and high output bioenergy crops.

AB Eighteen ginger cultivars from Northwest Himalayan region, showing significant differences in rhizome size, texture and pungency, were selected and characterized both by chemical and genetic analyses. The genetic analysis was undertaken utilizing molecular markers (ISSR and SSR) while chemical characterization was done through HPLC of four chemical markers (gingerol homologues and shogaol). The data revealed moderate to high diversity in the collection, clustering them broadly into two groups. Both ISSR and SSR techniques were efficient in distinguishing all the 18 ginger cultivars, however, SSR markers were observed to be better in displaying average polymorphism (77.8%) than ISSR (66.7%). Based on statistical analysis, one ISSR and two SSR primers could be identified which effectively distinguished closely related ginger cultivars. Chemical profiling and subsequent multivariate analysis distinguished five lines which were distinct from rest of the collection. The study has contributed in understanding the genetic and chemical diversity of the region, characterization of lines for commercial exploitation and ginger gene pool conservation.

AB Domesticated crops experience strong human-mediated selection aimed at developing high-yielding varieties adapted to local conditions. To detect regions of the wheat genome subject to selection during improvement, we developed a high-throughput array to interrogate 9,000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a worldwide sample of 2,994 accessions of hexaploid wheat including landraces and modern cultivars. Using a SNP-based diversity map we characterized the impact of crop improvement on genomic and geographic patterns of genetic diversity. We found evidence of a small population bottleneck and extensive use of ancestral variation often traceable to founders of cultivars from diverse geographic regions. Analyzing genetic differentiation among populations and the extent of haplotype sharing, we identified allelic variants subjected to selection during improvement. Selective sweeps were found around genes involved in the regulation of flowering time and phenology. An introgression of a wild relative-derived gene conferring resistance to a fungal pathogen was detected by haplotype-based analysis. Comparing selective sweeps identified in different populations, we show that selection likely acts on distinct targets or multiple functionally equivalent alleles in different portions of the geographic range of wheat. The majority of the selected alleles were present at low frequency in local populations, suggesting either weak selection pressure or temporal variation in the targets of directional selection during breeding probably associated with changing agricultural practices or environmental conditions. The developed SNP chip and map of genetic variation provide a resource for advancing wheat breeding and supporting future population genomic and genome-wide association studies in wheat.

AB Background: Identification of QTL with large phenotypic effects conserved across genetic backgrounds and environments is one of the prerequisites for crop improvement using marker assisted selection (MAS). The objectives of this study were to identify meta-QTL (mQTL) for grain yield (GY) and anthesis silking interval (ASI) across 18 bi-parental maize populations evaluated in the same conditions across 2-4 managed water stressed and 3-4 well watered environments.
   Results: The meta-analyses identified 68 mQTL (9 QTL specific to ASI, 15 specific to GY, and 44 for both GY and ASI). Mean phenotypic variance explained by each mQTL varied from 1.2 to 13.1% and the overall average was 6.5%. Few QTL were detected under both environmental treatments and/or multiple (>4 populations) genetic backgrounds. The number and 95% genetic and physical confidence intervals of the mQTL were highly reduced compared to the QTL identified in the original studies. Each physical interval of the mQTL consisted of 5 to 926 candidate genes.
   Conclusions: Meta-analyses reduced the number of QTL by 68% and narrowed the confidence intervals up to 12-fold. At least the 4 mQTL (mQTL2.2, mQTL6.1, mQTL7.5 and mQTL9.2) associated with GY under both water-stressed and well-watered environments and detected up to 6 populations may be considered for fine mapping and validation to confirm effects in different genetic backgrounds and pyramid them into new drought resistant breeding lines. This is the first extensive report on meta-analysis of data from over 3100 individuals genotyped using the same SNP platform and evaluated in the same conditions across a wide range of managed water-stressed and well-watered environments.

AB The current limitations in genome sequencing technology require the construction of physical maps for high-quality draft sequences of large plant genomes, such as that of Aegilops tauschii, the wheat D-genome progenitor. To construct a physical map of the Ae. tauschii genome, we fingerprinted 461,706 bacterial artificial chromosome clones, assembled contigs, designed a 10K Ae. tauschii Infinium SNP array, constructed a 7,185-marker genetic map, and anchored on the map contigs totaling 4.03 Gb. Using whole genome shotgun reads, we extended the SNP marker sequences and found 17,093 genes and gene fragments. We showed that collinearity of the Ae. tauschii genes with Brachypodium distachyon, rice, and sorghum decreased with phylogenetic distance and that structural genome evolution rates have been high across all investigated lineages in subfamily Pooideae, including that of Brachypodieae. We obtained additional information about the evolution of the seven Triticeae chromosomes from 12 ancestral chromosomes and uncovered a pattern of centromere inactivation accompanying nested chromosome insertions in grasses. We showed that the density of noncollinear genes along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes positively correlates with recombination rates, suggested a cause, and showed that new genes, exemplified by disease resistance genes, are preferentially located in high-recombination chromosome regions.

AB High amylopectin grains of waxy sorghum have a high economic value in the food and bioenergy industries because of their increased starch digestibility and higher ethanol conversion rate compared with wild-type sorghum grains. Mutation in the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) gene contributes to the waxy phenotype. Two classes of waxy alleles, wx(a) and wx(b), have been characterized previously. In the present work, we identified two novel types of waxy mutations in the sorghum GBSS gene, designated as wx(c) and wx(d). The wx(c) allele has a G deletion at the 5' splicing site of the ninth intron, causing a shift of the 5' cleavage site; in turn, a reading frame shift occurred and resulted in an early translation termination. The wx(d) allele contained a mutation at the 3' splicing site of the 10th intron, which led to a splicing site shift and resulted in the deletion of five amino acids (GTGKK) in the predicted translation product. Furthermore, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed to detect the wx(c) and wx(d) alleles. With these markers, classification of waxy alleles was performed in nearly 100 sorghum accessions from our breeding program. Most waxy sorghum cultivars in China were either wx(a) or wx(c), implying that these two mutations are preferentially maintained during domestic selection in glutinous sorghum production.

AB Chromosome identification using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is widely used in cytogenetic research. It is a diagnostic tool helpful in chromosome identification. It can also be used to characterize alien intro-gressions, when exercised in a combination with genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). This work aims to find chromosome identification of Aegilops species and Aegilops x Secale amphiploids, which can be used in cereal breeding as a source of favourable agronomic traits. Four diploid and two tetraploid Aegilops species and three Aegilops x Secale hybrids were analysed using FISH with pSc119.2, pAs1, 5S rDNA and 25S rDNA clones to differentiate the U-, M-, S-sh- and D-subgenome chromosomes of Aegilops genus. Additionally, GISH for chromosome categorization was carried out. Differences in the hybridization patterns allowed to identify all U-, M-, S-sh- and D-subgenome chromosomes. Some differences in localization of the rDNA, pSc119.2 and pAs1 sequences between analogue subgenomes in diploid and tetraploid species and Aegilops x Secale hybrids were detected. The hybridization pattern of the M and S genome was more variable than that of the U and D genome. An importance of the cytogenetic markers in plant breeding and their possible role in chromosome structure, function and evolution is discussed.

AB The sterilising cytoplasm from Triticum timopheevii is presently considered to be the most promising as regards to the seed production of triticale hybrid cultivars. This study was aimed at the utilisation of Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) for the preliminary identification of genomic regions with loci controlling male sterility/fertility in the field-grown F-2 generation of the interline hybrid between male sterile line CMS-Salvo 15/1 and restorer line Stan I. The fertility of plants was examined by visual scoring as well as by the assessment of seed setting within bagged spikes. For DNA analyses, 92 individuals representing opposite phenotypes (male sterile vs. fully male fertile) were chosen from the whole F2 population, which consisted of 414 plants. The constructed genetic map consists of 759 DArT markers distributed in 24 linkage groups that cover a distance of 974.4 cM. Application of the interval mapping method and the Kruskal-Wallis test enabled the identification of six genomic regions engaged in the restoration of male fertility within the mapping population. The most effective restorer genes were found on chromosomes of the sixth homeologic group, i.e. on 6R (the most efficient), 6A and 6B. Additionally, linkage groups assigned to chromosomes 1BS, 3A and 3A/3B were important for the determination of male fertility.

AB Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is one of the most serious diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The discovery of new Pgt races in Africa, Ug99 and its variants, brings a new threat to global wheat production. Pyramiding several stem rust resistance genes into adapted varieties as opposed to breeding varieties with a single resistance gene is considered a more effective method to combat new races, but the success of gene pyramiding depends on the availability of molecular markers tightly linked to resistance genes. Markers for Ug99-effective genes, Sr2, Sr22, Sr26, Sr32, Sr35, Sr39, and Sr40, were evaluated for usefulness in marker-assisted selection (MAS) of hard winter wheat (HWW) using 10 resistance gene donor lines, 17 recently released U.S. HWW varieties or breeding lines, and 20 advanced introgression lines. Markers XcsIH81-BM and XcsIH81-AG for Sr22, Xsr26#43 and XBE51879 for Sr26, Xbarc55 for Sr32, Xbarc51 for Sr35, Xrwg27 for Sr39, Xsr39#22r for Sr40, and csSr2-derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker for Sr2 are diagnostic for the set of HWW accessions evaluated in this study. These markers should be useful in marker-assisted pyramiding of stem rust resistance genes to develop HWW cultivars with multiple gene resistance against Ug99 races.

AB Dwarfing germplasms are crucial to the development of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties with ideal plant height and combinations of agronomic traits. A novel dwarfing wheat line, AS34, was developed in this study by somatic variation. This new wheat germplasm was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, genomic in situ hybridization, and genomic scanning with 44 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and our analysis showed that AS34 was clearly derived from the somatic variation of Yumai66 (YM66), its tissue culture parent, but not from natural hybridization. Molecular tests using known primers specific to Rht8 and Rht-B1b genes indicated that AS34 and its parent contained Rht8 but not Rht-B1b in their genomes, which was not consistent with previous reports. Similar to YM66, AS34 was sensitive to gibberellic acid, and this characteristic might be induced only by Rht8 or by Rht8 and the new dwarfing genes simultaneously. Genetic analysis revealed that the new dwarfing trait in AS34 was controlled by multiple quantitative genes, and data from the F 2 population yielded no key quantitative trait locus. According to the results of genomic scanning for different SSR markers, some of the new dwarfing genes in AS34 might be located on chromosome 4B. The new dwarfing material had positive effects on the agronomic traits related to grain yield in F-2 populations, particularly the variation range in plant height. This dwarfing resource will be potentially used in wheat breeding for the development of new wheat varieties with available agronomic traits.

AB Fifty-five normal-weaned Angus steers (268 +/- 22 kg; 265 +/- 16 d of age) were used to evaluate the effects of starch- vs. fiber-based energy supplements for stocker cattle grazing low-quality dormant native range on growth performance, body composition, and adipose tissue development of different fat depots. Steers were randomly allotted to 4 treatments: 1.02 kg.steer(-1).d(-1) of a 40% CP cottonseed meal-based supplement (CON), corn/soybean meal-based supplement fed at 1% of BW (CORN), soybean hull/soybean meal-based supplement fed at 1% of BW (SBH), or dried distillers grains with solubles fed at 1% of BW (DDGS). All supplements were individually fed 5 d/wk during the 121-d winter grazing phase. After winter grazing, 3 steers per treatment were harvested to determine body composition and carcass characteristics, and collect subcutaneous (SC) and perirenal (PR) adipose tissue samples. The remaining steers grazed cool-season grass pastures for 74 d without supplementation before finishing. Steers were fed a common finishing diet for 113 d before harvest, at which time carcass characteristics were collected at a commercial abattoir. Energy supplementation increased (P < 0.01) winter grazing ADG compared with CON steers, and CORN steers had greater (P < 0.01) ADG than SBH and DDGS steers. Energy supplementation increased (P < 0.04) mesenteric/omental fat mass but did not influence (P > 0.13) 12th rib fat thickness or marbling score at intermediate harvest compared with CON steers. The mRNA expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and markers of adipogenesis were greater (P < 0.05) in PR adipose tissue of energy-supplemented steers compared with CON steers but not in SC adipose tissue. Fiber-supplemented steers had greater (P < 0.01) mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase and fatty acid binding protein 4 compared with CORN steers in PR adipose tissue but not SC adipose tissue. At final harvest, energy-supplemented steers had greater (P < 0.05) KPH and yield grade than CON steers, but no differences (P = 0.75) in marbling score were observed. Neither energy supplementation nor type of energy supplement influenced intramuscular fat deposition in stocker cattle grazing dormant native range. These data suggest that the total energy intake and stage of animal maturity during grazing supplementation were not great enough to influence marbling deposition.

AB Molecular markers for the red grain color (R) loci controlling seed color and the polyphenol oxidase (Ppo-A1) locus controlling polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in seed have recently been developed. These markers provided the opportunity to convert the hard red spring wheat cultivars Choteau and Hank to white-seeded versions with high and low PPO levels, respectively. These sets of near-isogenic lines provided material to test the effects of seed color and PPO activity on a range of end-use quality traits. We tested recurrent parents Choteau and Hank, along with nearisogenic derivatives with white seed, in two replicated trials in Bozeman, Montana, for end-use quality parameters. The white-seeded lines consisted of both high-and low-PPO near-isogenic lines. The primary impact of white seed was the production of whole wheat bread with a perceived sweeter taste relative to the red-seeded lines. Noodle color was not consistently impacted by the level of PPO variation despite relatively large reductions in PPO level. The alleles for white seed color did not appear to impact agronomic traits. These results suggested that hard white low-PPO hard spring wheat would be advantageous in terms of conferring brighter color to Asian noodles and a sweeter taste to whole wheat bread.

AB The sy19 mutation, which impairs the homology of meiotic chromosome synapsis in rye, were mapped using a specially created F-2 population by means of isozyme Acph1 locus and microsatellite (SSR) markers. The sy19 gene was localized in the chromosome 7R in the pericentromeric region of long arm based on the linked inheritance with the Acph1 locus. The locus was linked with five rye SSR markers, with the Xrems1234 locus being located closest to the sy19 gene (6.4 cM). The genetic map of the analyzed chromosome 7R region includes ten markers and the sy19 locus. A possible function of the Sy1 and Sy19 genes based on the data on comparative genomics is discussed.

The possibility of the introgression of the Waxy gene of T. timopheevii into the wheat genome was demonstrated in several AWH lines using the set of molecular markers. Allelic gene variants responsible for the bread-making quality were revealed in 22 AWH lines, which make it possible to detect the most superior lines for both molecular-genetic analysis and applied research.

AB Greenbug is one of the most aggressive pests of barley and wheat. In Argentina, yield losses of wheat, barley, oat and sorghum crops caused by greenbug are chronic and at times severe. Since Marker Assisted selection for greenbug resistance genes in barley is very limited, the purpose of the current study was to map greenbug resistance genes in doubled haploid (DH) lines and to identify candidate genes. A set of DH lines of the Oregon-Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population derived from the cross between OWBDOM and OWBREC and both parental lines were screened for tolerance to greenbug. There was significant variation among the DH lines in foliar area (FA), dry weight (DW) and chlorophyll contents (Ch) between infested and control DH lines. Three main QTLs were identified. These QTLs explained 82 % of the FA, 80 % of DW and 58 % of Ch variability of infested plants. The initial and final FA and DW of controls and final DW of infested plants were associated with the same molecular markers on chromosome 2H (Vrs1, BmAc0144f, GBR259, GBS705). The final FA of infested plants was significantly linked to molecular markers on chromosome 5H (GBRO986, GBR518, GBM1483, GBR1082). The positive alleles were provided by OWBDOM. The content of chlorophyll of infested plants was associated with the marker loci Ris44, GBR1608, GBR1637N and GBS0785 on chromosome 7H, with the positive alleles provided by OWBREC. Both parents contributed to different tolerance traits. The QTLs found in this population are new greenbug resistance loci. A sequence homology search was performed to derive the putative function of the genes linked to the QTLs.

AB In order to establish a specific identification method for genetically modified (GM) wheat, exogenous insert DNA and flanking sequence between exogenous fragment and recombinant chromosome of GM wheat B73-6-1 were successfully acquired by means of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR strategies. Newly acquired exogenous fragment covered the full-length sequence of transformed genes such as transformed plasmid and corresponding functional genes including marker uidA, herbicide-resistant bar, ubiquitin promoter, and high-molecular-weight gluten subunit. The flanking sequence between insert DNA revealed high similarity with Triticum turgidum A gene (GenBank: AY494981.1). A specific PCR detection method for GM wheat B73-6-1 was established on the basis of primers designed according to the flanking sequence. This specific PCR method was validated by GM wheat, GM corn, GM soybean, GM rice, and non-GM wheat. The specifically amplified target band was observed only in GM wheat B73-6-1. This method is of high specificity, high reproducibility, rapid identification, and excellent accuracy for the identification of GM wheat B73-6-1.

ID STEM SOLIDNESS LOCUS; AGRONOMIC PERFORMANCE
AB 'WB9879CLP' hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Reg. No. CV-1086, PI 666046) was developed by the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 2012 to the commercial partner Westbred, a subsidiary of Monsanto. WB9879CLP is a two-gene Clearfield wheat for use with the imidazolinone herbicide Beyond (BASF). WB9879CLP was developed by backcrossing alleles for resistance to the imidazolinone herbicide class into the recurrent parent 'Choteau'. Choteau has solid stems, which provide resistance to the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Nort.). The wheat stem sawfly is a major yield-reducing pest in large areas of Montana and surrounding regions. Alleles for herbicide resistance at TaAHAS1D and TaAHAS1B were selected during the backcrossing process and line derivation using polymerase chain reaction markers developed by BASF. Two years of replicated yield trials at a total of 16 sites showed that WB9879CLP is similar to Choteau in most agronomic characteristics. WB9879CLP showed no symptoms of damage at any of 13 testing sites when imidazolinone herbicide was applied at two times the recommended rate. WB9879CLP is the first Clearfield solid-stem wheat variety for sawfly infested sites in Montana and adjoining regions.

AB Montana State University announces the release of two sets of near-isogenic lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) containing all homozygous combinations of alleles at the R loci for seed color to provide materials for dissecting the impact of allelic variation at individual loci. Marker-assisted selection was used to develop all possible homozygous genotypes at the BC 5 generation after introducing alleles for white seed into lines homozygous for alleles causing red seed. The following sets of lines were developed, where the letter a indicates homozygosity for the a allele for white seed color and the letter b indicates homozygosity for the b allele for red seed color at R-A1, R-B1, and R-D1, respectively.

AB Narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) is a valuable legume crop for animal feed and human health food because of its high proteins content. However, the genetics of seed storage proteins is unclear, limiting further improvement of protein quantity and quality. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry was used for the first time to analyze lupin seed storage proteins and the spectra generated was treated as markers to investigate the chromosome locations controlling seed storage proteins in the narrow-leafed lupin. In a recombinant inbred line population of 89 individuals, 48 polymorphic protein peaks were identified and seven of which were successfully mapped onto four existing linkage groups: two on NLL-04, three on NLL-05, one on NLL-07 and one on NLL-14, with LOD values ranging from 2.6 to 7.7 confirming a significant linkage. Most protein-based markers showed distorted segregation and were failed to be integrated into the reference map. Among them, 31 were grouped into six clusters and the other ten were totally unlinked. This study provides a significant clue to study the comparative genomics/proteomics among legumes as well as for protein marker-assisted breeding. The distribution pattern of genes controlling seed storage protein revealed in this study probably exists universally among legumes or even all plants and animals. Whether genes controlling seed storage protein share the same gene expression pattern controlling other enzymes and what is the mechanism behind it are the questions which remain to be answered in the future.

AB Wheat production is currently threatened by widely virulent races of the wheat stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, that are part of the TTKSK (also known as 'Ug99') race group. The diploid D genome donor species Aegilops tauschii (2n = 2x = 14, DD) is a readily accessible source of resistance to TTKSK and its derivatives that can be transferred to hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). To expedite transfer of TTKSK resistance from Ae. tauschii, a direct hybridization approach was undertaken that integrates gene transfer, mapping, and introgression into one process. Direct crossing of Ae. tauschii accessions with an elite wheat breeding line combines the steps of gene transfer and introgression while development of mapping populations during gene transfer enables the identification of closely linked markers. Direct crosses were made using TTKSK-resistant Ae. tauschii accessions TA1662 and PI 603225 as males and a stem rust-susceptible T. aestivum breeding line, KS05HW14, as a female. Embryo rescue enabled recovery of F-1 (ABDD) plants that were backcrossed as females to the hexaploid recurrent parent. Stem rust-resistant BC1F1 plants from each Ae. tauschii donor source were used as males to generate BC2F1 mapping populations. Bulked segregant analysis of BC2F1 genotypes was performed using 70 SSR loci distributed across the D genome. Using this approach, stem rust resistance genes from both accessions were located on chromosome arm 1DS and mapped using SSR and EST-STS markers. An allelism test indicated the stem rust resistance gene transferred from PI 603225 is Sr33. Race specificity suggests the stem rust resistance gene transferred from TA1662 is unique and this gene has been temporarily designated SrTA1662. Stem rust resistance genes derived from TA1662 and PI 603225 have been made available with selectable molecular markers in genetic backgrounds suitable for stem rust resistance breeding.

AB Non-additive allelic interactions underlie over dominant and under dominant inheritance, which explain positive and negative heterosis. These heteroses are often observed in the aboveground traits, but rarely reported in root. We identified a very short root (VSR) phenotype in the F-1 hybrid between the common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landrace Chinese Spring and synthetic wheat accession TA4152-71. When germinated in tap water, primary roots of the parental lines reached similar to 15 cm 10 days after germination, but those of the F-1 hybrid were similar to 3 cm long. Selfing populations segregated at a 1 (long-root) to 1 (short-root) ratio, indicating that VSR is controlled by a non-additive interaction between two alleles in a single gene locus, designated as Vsr1. Genome mapping localized the Vsr1 locus in a 3.8-cM interval delimited by markers XWL954 and XWL2506 on chromosome arm 5DL. When planted in vermiculite with supplemental fertilizer, the F-1 hybrid had normal root growth, virtually identical to the parental lines, but the advanced backcrossing populations segregated for VSR, indicating that the F-1 VSR expression was suppressed by interactions between other genes in the parental background and the vermiculite conditions. Preliminary physiological analyses showed that the VSR suppression is independent of light status but related to potassium homeostasis. Phenotyping additional hybrids between common wheat and synthetics revealed a high VSR frequency and their segregation data suggested more Vsr loci involved. Because the VSR plants can be regularly maintained and readily phenotyped at the early developmental stage, it provides a model for studies of non-additive interactions in wheat.

AB The introgression of Reduced height (Rht)-B1b and Rht-D1b into bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties beginning in the 1960s led to improved lodging resistance and yield, providing a major contribution to the 'green revolution'. Although wheat Rht-1 and surrounding sequence is available, the genetic composition of this region has not been examined in a homoeologous series. To determine this, three Rht-1-containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences derived from the A, B, and D genomes of the bread wheat variety Chinese Spring (CS) were fully assembled and analyzed. This revealed that Rht-1 and two upstream genes were highly conserved among the homoeologs. In contrast, transposable elements (TEs) were not conserved among homoeologs with the exception of intronic miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs). In relation to the Triticum urartu ancestral line, CS-A genic sequences were highly conserved and several colinear TEs were present. Comparative analysis of the CS wheat BAC sequences with assembled Poaceae genomes showed gene synteny and amino acid sequences were well preserved. Further 5' and 3' of the wheat BAC sequences, a high degree of gene colinearity is present among the assembled Poaceae genomes. In the 20 kb of sequence flanking Rht-1, five conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) were present among the CS wheat homoeologs and among all the Poaceae members examined. Rht-A1 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4 and three closely flanking genetic markers were identified. The tools developed herein will enable detailed studies of Rht-1 and linked genes that affect abiotic and biotic stress response in wheat.

AB Races of stem rust fungus pose a major threat to wheat production worldwide. We mapped adult plant resistance (APR) to Ug99 in 141 lines of a PBW343/Muu recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population by phenotyping them for three seasons at Njoro, Kenya in field trials and genotyping them with Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. Moderately susceptible parent PBW343 and APR parent Muu displayed mean stem rust severities of 66.6 and 5 %, respectively. The mean disease severity of RILs ranged from 1 to 100 %, with an average of 23.3 %. Variance components for stem rust severity were highly significant (p < 0.001) for RILs and seasons and the heritability (h (2)) for the disease ranged between 0.78 and 0.89. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified four consistent genomic regions on chromosomes 2BS, 3BS, 5BL, and 7AS; three contributed by Muu (QSr.cim-2BS, QSr.cim-3BS and QSr.cim-7AS) and one (QSr.cim-5BL) derived from PBW343. RILs with flanking markers for these QTLs had significantly lower severities than those lacking the markers, and combinations of QTLs had an additive effect, significantly enhancing APR. The QTL identified on chromosome 3BS mapped to the matching region as the known APR gene Sr2. Four additional QTLs on chromosomes 1D, 3A, 4B, and 6A reduced disease severity significantly at least once in three seasons. Our results show a complex nature of APR to stem rust where Sr2 and other minor slow rusting resistance genes can confer a higher level of resistance when present together.

DT Article
ID COMMON WHEAT; LOCATION; MARKERS; LINES
AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is an important disease that causes substantial yield losses in wheat (Triticum aestivum) in China and other parts of the world. This foliar disease can be effectively managed by host resistance. The Chinese landrace Hongyanglazi from Shaanxi province is highly resistant to many Bgt isolates at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis using an F-2:3 population derived from a cross between Hongyanglazi and susceptible cultivar Zhongzuo 9504 indicated that Hongyanglazi carried a single recessive gene (tentatively designated PmHYLZ) conferring its resistance to Bgt isolate E09. PmHYLZ was flanked by EST marker BE606897 and microsatellite marker Xgwm46 on chromosome 7BS at genetic distances of 1.7 and 3.6 cM, respectively. This gene differed from Pm40, also located on 7BS, by origin, linked markers, and reactions to 13 Bgt isolates. Based on these findings, PmHYLZ was permanently designated as Pm47.

AB Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) originated by hybridization of tetraploid Triticum turgidum (genomes AABB) with Aegilops tauschii (genomes DD). Genetic relationships between A.tauschii and the wheat D genome are of central importance for the understanding of wheat origin and subsequent evolution. Genetic relationships among 477 A.tauschii and wheat accessions were studied with the A.tauschii 10K Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Aegilops tauschii consists of two lineages (designated 1 and 2) having little genetic contact. Each lineage consists of two closely related sublineages. A population within lineage 2 in the southwestern and southern Caspian appears to be the main source of the wheat D genome. Lineage 1 contributed as little as 0.8% of the wheat D genome. Triticum aestivum is subdivided into the western and Far Eastern populations. The Far Eastern population conserved the genetic make-up of the nascent T.aestivum more than the western population. In wheat, diversity is high in chromosomes 1D and 2D and it correlates in all wheat D-genome and A.tauschii chromosomes with recombination rates. Gene flow from A.tauschii was an important source of wheat genetic diversity and shaped its distribution along the D-genome chromosomes.

AB In many cultivated crop species there is limited genetic variation available for the development of new higher yielding varieties adapted to climate change and sustainable farming practises. The distant relatives of crop species provide a vast and largely untapped reservoir of genetic variation for a wide range of agronomically important traits that can be exploited by breeders for crop improvement. In this paper, in what we believe to be the largest introgression programme undertaken in the monocots, we describe the transfer of the entire genome of Festuca pratensis into Lolium perenne in overlapping chromosome segments. The L. perenne/F. pratensis introgressions were identified and characterised via 131 simple sequence repeats and 1612 SNPs anchored to the rice genome. Comparative analyses were undertaken to determine the syntenic relationship between L. perenne/F. pratensis and rice, wheat, barley, sorghum and Brachypodium distachyon. Analyses comparing recombination frequency and gene distribution indicated that a large proportion of the genes within the genome are located in the proximal regions of chromosomes which undergo low/very low frequencies of recombination. Thus, it is proposed that past breeding efforts to produce improved varieties have centred on the subset of genes located in the distal regions of chromosomes where recombination is highest. The use of alien introgression for crop improvement is important for meeting the challenges of global food supply and the monocots such as the forage grasses and cereals, together with recent technological advances in molecular biology, can help meet these challenges.

AB The objective of this study was to develop a species-specific PCR assay for authentication and traceability of Yellow Drum (Nibea albiflora) from surimi products using a primer pair design based on mt-DNA 12S rDNA sequences for amplification of 193 bp DNA fragments. The specificity of the PCR assay was broadly tested with DNA of eleven species of samples, such as Yellow Drum, Large Yellow Croaker, Hairtail, Silver carp, Grass Carp, Bighead carp, Eel, chicken, pork, corn starch and wheat starch, all of which were mainly used in surimi products in China. The results showed that positive amplification was only observed in N. albiflora. The detection limits of the PCR assay was found to be less than 0.5% in admixed fresh surimi products containing Yellow Drum and Large Yellow Croaker. Even in chewed and vomited samples, N. albiflora could also be authenticated and traced successfully. In conclusion, the developed assay was very specific and sensitive for rapid authentication and traceability of N. albiflora in deeply processed surimi products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide and its production faces pressing challenges, the solution of which demands genome information. However, the large, highly repetitive hexaploid wheat genome has been considered intractable to standard sequencing approaches. Therefore the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) proposes to map and sequence the genome on a chromosome-by-chromosome basis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We have constructed a physical map of the long arm of bread wheat chromosome 1A using chromosome-specific BAC libraries by High Information Content Fingerprinting (HICF). Two alternative methods (FPC and LTC) were used to assemble the fingerprints into a high-resolution physical map of the chromosome arm. A total of 365 molecular markers were added to the map, in addition to 1122 putative unique transcripts that were identified by microarray hybridization. The final map consists of 1180 FPC-based or 583 LTC-based contigs.
   Conclusions/Significance: The physical map presented here marks an important step forward in mapping of hexaploid bread wheat. The map is orders of magnitude more detailed than previously available maps of this chromosome, and the assignment of over a thousand putative expressed gene sequences to specific map locations will greatly assist future functional studies. This map will be an essential tool for future sequencing of and positional cloning within chromosome 1A.

AB Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world. However, the complex polyploid nature of its genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome, as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T. turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGA(m)A(m)), is central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement(1). The progenitor species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu(2), which resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the ancestor of the B genome(3)) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome(4)), especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat.

AB The race of watermelon powdery mildew (PM) present in South Korea was confirmed, and genetic inheritance of resistance to this race was determined from a cultivars 'Arka Manik'. Bioassay tested on a set of melon differential genotypes indicated that the race of P. xathii predominating in South Korea was either belonged to race 1W or another race different from race 2W. Inheritance of PM resistance was studied from F-2, F-2:3, and reciprocal backcross generations derived from 'Arka Manik' (resistant cultivar) x HS3355 (susceptible line). The segregation ratios indicated that resistance to PM in 'Arka Manik' is conditioned by a single incompletely dominant gene (Pm1.1). Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of F2 plants using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) identified one polymorphic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) band (OP-R483) and a close linkage (3.6 cM) was observed between resistance and OP-483. The marker OP-483 was converted to cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS-G/C) and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker (MCA-A/G) using melting curve analysis. MCA-A/G marker genotyping of a wide range of susceptible breeding lines revealed that the marker allele of 'Arka Manik' was unique in breeding populations.

AB Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), encoded by a complex multigene family, play an important role in the processing quality of wheat flour. Although members of this gene family have been identified in several wheat varieties, the allelic variation and composition of LMW-GS genes in common wheat are not well understood. In the present study, using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system and the full-length gene cloning method, a comprehensive molecular analysis of LMW-GS genes was conducted in a representative population, the micro-core collections (MCC) of Chinese wheat germplasm. Generally, > 15 LMW-GS genes were identified from individual MCC accessions, of which 46 were located at the Glu-A3 locus, 35 at the Glu-B3 locus, and eight at the Glu-D3 locus. LMW-GS genes at the Glu-A3 locus showed the highest allelic diversity, followed by the Glu-B3 genes, while the Glu-D3 genes were extremely conserved among MCC accessions. Expression and sequence analysis showed that 913 active LMW-GS genes were present in each accession. Sequence identity analysis showed that all i-type genes present at the Glu-A3 locus formed a single group, the s-type genes located at Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci comprised a unique group, while high-diversity m-type genes were classified into four groups and detected in all Glu-3 loci. These results contribute to the functional analysis of LMW-GS genes and facilitate improvement of bread-making quality by wheat molecular breeding programmes.

AB This article reviews the recent progress of research on fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat. It addresses the broad areas of strategies for disease management, biological control, the pathogen (Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae)), mycotoxins, the effects of dwarfing genes on FHB severity, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and new perspectives. Where there are recent reviews on this subject, we have deliberately examined the subsequent literature to provide an update on research. With few resistant cultivars available even now, the main tools to manage the disease remain rotation, varietal selection, disease forecasting and fungicides. A few biocontrol organisms are being considered for commercial application. The pathogen's sexual life cycle has been investigated in depth, and with its complete genome sequence known, the pathways and genes controlling the sexual development and ascospore release of F. graminearum are being explored. The 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol chemotype of F. graminearum has increased in prevalence in Canada with attendant risks of higher DON levels in cereal grain. Stringent limits on allowable levels of Fusarium mycotoxins in the food/feed chain have been enacted in Europe and the USA, but regulations for Canada are only at the discussion stage with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Efforts to develop FHB-resistant lines proceed apace, as these can be selected in most wheat populations despite the adverse effects of dwarfing genes on FHB severity. While more quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease resistance continue to be identified and mapped, new resistant cultivars remain disappointingly few. We present some encouraging early results from an alternative approach based on epigenetics.

AB The recessive spontaneous sy18 mutation with nonhomologous synapsis was mapped in rye. The sy18 gene was located in the centromeric region of chromosome 2R in relation to three rye SSR (simple sequence repeats) loci, i.e., Xrems1130, Xrems1203, and Xscm43, and one wheat SSR locus Xgwm132. The desynaptic sy18 gene is located in the interval between Xrems1130 and Xrems1203 markers at a distance of 0.5 cM and 3.1 cM, respectively. The possible evolutionary relationships of the mapped gene with homologous loci of the related species are discussed.

AB A suppressor screen using dwarf mutants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) led to the isolation of overgrowth derivatives, which retained the original dwarfing gene but grew at a faster rate because of a new mutation. The new mutations were in the Slender1 (Sln1) gene (11/13 cases), which encodes the DELLA protein central to gibberellin (GA) signalling, showed 100% genetic linkage to Sln1 (1/13), or were in the Spindly1 (Spy1) gene (1/13), which encodes another protein involved in GA signalling. The overgrowth mutants were characterized by increased GA signalling, although the extent still depended on the background GA biosynthesis capacity, GA receptor function, and DELLA activity. A comparison between two GA responses, -amylase production and leaf growth rate, revealed degrees of specificity for both the overgrowth allele and the GA response under consideration. Many overgrowth mutants were also isolated in a dwarf line of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 19 new alleles were identified in the Rht-B1 gene, one of the Green Revolution semi-dwarfing genes and the orthologue of Sln1. The sites of amino acid substitutions in the DELLA proteins of both species provide insight into DELLA function, and included examples where identical but independent substitutions were observed. In both species, the starting lines were too dwarfed to be directly useful in breeding programmes, but new overgrowth derivatives with semidwarf heights have now been characterized. The variation they exhibit in GA-influenced traits identifies novel alleles with perfect markers that are of potential use in breeding.

AB Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme in nitrogen (N) assimilation, particularly during seed development. Three cytosolic GS isoforms (HvGS1) were identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Golden Promise). Quantitation of gene expression, localization and response to N supply revealed that each gene plays a non-redundant role in different tissues and during development. Localization of HvGS1_1 in vascular cells of different tissues, combined with its abundance in the stem and its response to changes in N supply, indicate that it is important in N transport and remobilization. HvGS1_1 is located on chromosome 6H at 72.54 cM, close to the marker HVM074 which is associated with a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for grain protein content (GPC). HvGS1_1 may be a potential candidate gene to manipulate barley GPC. HvGS1_2 mRNA was localized to the leaf mesophyll cells, in the cortex and pericycle of roots, and was the dominant HvGS1 isoform in these tissues. HvGS1_2 expression increased in leaves with an increasing supply of N, suggesting its role in the primary assimilation of N. HvGS1_3 was specifically and predominantly localized in the grain, being highly expressed throughout grain development. HvGS1_3 expression increased specifically in the roots of plants grown on high NH+<sub arrange="stack">4, suggesting that it has a primary role in grain N assimilation and also in the protection against ammonium toxicity in roots. The expression of HvGS1 genes is directly correlated with protein and enzymatic activity, indicating that transcriptional regulation is of prime importance in the control of GS activity in barley.

AB Brassica species, B. napus (canola), B. rapa and B. oleracea, are important sources of nutritionally valuable vegetable oil and protein-rich meal for animals and humans. Sequencing of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, has opened the way for investigations into the complex structure of the Brassica genomes, offering important insight into their evolution and composition. We use this sequence information for the characterization and functional analysis of SSR sequences that have diverged between the Brassica species. A total of 56 species-diverged sequences containing simple repeat units (SDS-SSR) of B. napus and its diploid progenitor species B. rapa and B. oleracea were isolated and characterized. Of these, 40 sequences showed homology with other Brassica sequences. Using the SSR Locator software, only 23 sequences were found to have SSRs, possibly due to the loss of SSR units in the process of species divergence. Sequence alignments with A. thaliana revealed that these species-diverged SSR sequences were responsible for Brassica divergence for differences between Brassica species in several genomic regions. Six active genes related to transferase, protein, transcription factor and retroelements were found in the SDS-SSRs. These results will further improve our understanding of the characteristics of species-diverged SSR fragments and their contribution to genome differentiation.

AB Wheat powdery mildew resistance mechanisms have been studied extensively at genomic level, however, infection induced mitochondrial proteomic changes in resistant line have not been fully characterized. Being critical organelles of chemical energy metabolism, mitochondria have also been suggested to be involved in the environmental stress response. Using proteomic approaches, we did comparative analysis of mitochondrial proteome in resistant wheat near-isogenic line (NIL) (BrockxJing4117) and its recurrent parent Jing 411 after infection of Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). More than 50 down-regulated mitochondrial protein spots were identified in NIL after 24-h pathogen inoculation, and their abundance recovered to the levels prior to infection after extended inoculation (72-h). We further analyzed a subgroup of down-regulated proteins using mass spectrometry. MS/MS data analysis revealed the identities of nine protein spots and assigned them into three functional classes: synthesis of protein, disease resistance response and energy metabolism. For the first time we demonstrated pathogen stress induced mitochondrial proteomic changes and provided evidences that wheat powdery mildew resistance involves multiple biochemical events. Moreover, our results indicate that wheat mitochondrial proteome analysis can serve as a powerful tool to identify potential regulators of fungal invasion resistance.

AB Melanaphis sacchari causes serious damage to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) growth, development and productivity in many countries. A dominant gene (RMES1) conferring resistance to M. sacchari has been found in the grain sorghum variety Henong 16 (HN16), but fine mapping of the RMES1 locus remains to be reported. In this study, genetic populations segregating for RMES1 were prepared with HN16 and BTx623 as parental lines. The latter had been used for sorghum genome sequencing but was found to be susceptible to M. sacchari in this work. A total of 11 molecular markers were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6 harboring RMES1. The closest markers flanking the RMES1 locus were Sb6m2650 and Sb6rj2776, which delimited a chromosomal region of about 126 kb containing five predicted genes. The utility of the newly identified DNA markers for tagging RMES1 in molecular breeding of M. sacchari resistance, and further efforts in cloning RMES1, are discussed.

AB Thinopyrum intermedium has been hybridized extensively with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and several genes for disease resistance have been introgressed to cultivated wheat. However, there are very few reports about the Th. intermedium-derived seed storage protein genes which have been transferred into a wheat background by chromosome manipulation. Our aim is to identify several wheat-Th. intermedium ssp. trichophorum derivatives, and document these lines by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), molecular markers and seed storage protein analysis. We found that a novel Th. intermedium 1St#2 chromosome-specific high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) was transferred to the wheat-Thinopyrum derivative lines. The genomic sequence of the Thinopyrum-derived HMW-GS was characterized and designated Glu-1St#2x, since it resembled x-type glutenins in both the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain. It is much shorter than that of reported HMW-GS genes. The Glu-1St#2x sequence was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and resulted in the identical weight to the native protein. The GISH and newly developed chromosome Thinopyrum-specific DNA markers enabled physically location of Glu-1St#2x to the region FL0.60-1.00 on Th. intermedium 1St#2L chromosome arm. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Glu-1St#2x evolved earlier than other x-type HMW-GS homoeologues in modern wheat genomes. The effect of Glu-1St#2x on protein content, sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation value and improvement of solvent retention capacity in wheat background suggested that Th. intermedium chromosome 1St#2 may have potential for improvement of wheat end-product quality.

AB To feed the predicted extra two billion people by 2050, crop production must increase on existing cultivated land at a rate that challenges our current capability. Acid soils and aluminium (Al3+) toxicity restrict productivity worldwide but also offer the greatest opportunity for increases in global food production. Our understanding of the physiology, genetic control and the identification of genomic regions underlying Al resistance in important staple crops has increased greatly over the past 20 years, enabling the application of molecular breeding. In this study, we report the application of an efficient marker-assisted backcrossing (MAB) strategy for the introgression of the HvAACT1 gene which confers Al resistance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We conducted foreground and background selection using microsatellite (SSR) markers linked to HvAACT1 and SSR-based linkage maps, along with embryo rescue and a cost-effective DNA preparation method shortening the breeding cycle to similar to 18 months. The MAB strategy enabled the development of homozygous (BC3F2) Al-resistant lines with the smallest introgressed region and 98.7 % of the recurrent parent genome. The Al-resistant line yielded significantly more seeds (121 %) than its isogenic line in soil-based assays containing 12 % of Al saturation. This MAB strategy could be extended to other staple crops with similar molecular toolboxes, expanding their cultivation onto acid soils, and contributing to greater yield stability and food security, particularly in developing countries.

AB We developed a new stripe rust resistant line of common wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs) from a cross between wheat cv. 7182 and P. huashanica via embryo culture, and we refer to this line as 3-8-10-2. We characterized this new line by cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), EST-SSR, EST-STS, and disease resistance screening. GISH using P. huashanica genomic DNA as the probe indicated that a pair of Ns chromosomes with strong hybridization signals was introduced into 3-8-10-2. We screened 255 EST-SSR and EST-STS multiple-loci markers from seven wheat homoeologous groups in the parent lines. Of these, 90 markers were polymorphic with a polymorphism frequency of 40 %, while two EST-SSR markers and six EST-STS markers located on wheat chromosome group 5 produced specific bands in P. huashanica and 3-8-10-2, respectively. This suggested that the introduced Ns chromosome pair belonged to homoeologous group 5, which was identified using new genome-specific markers. After inoculation with stripe rust isolates, 3-8-10-2 exhibited stripe rust resistance that probably originated from its P. huashanica parent. 3-8-10-2 can be used as a donor source for introducing novel disease resistance genes into wheat during breeding programs with the assistance of molecular and cytogenetic markers. Moreover, 3-8-10-2 had improved agronomic characteristics compared with its parents. Therefore, the addition line could be exploited as an important bridge for wheat breeding and chromosome engineering.

AB Liang, J.-M., Wan, Q., Luo, Y., and Ma, Z.-H. 2013. Population genetic structures of Puccinia striiformis in Ningxia and Gansu provinces of China. Plant Dis. 97:501-509. Wheat stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive plant diseases in China. Gansu and Ningxia Provinces are considered to be the key areas for oversummering of this pathogen in China. In this study, 283 P striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates were collected in these two provinces. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to analyze the population genetics and to infer the chance of population exchanges between different geographic locations and seasons. The genotypic diversity of the Gansu population (0.514) was slightly higher than that of the Ningxia population (0.489). The occurrence of frequent population exchanges between these two regions was observed, showing that 40 AFLP genotypes were shared by the populations of the two provinces. Gene flow between these two regions in autumn and spring subpopulations was also detected. The genotype distribution in three populations of Ningxia from opposite sides of the Liupan Mountains revealed possible significant effects of the mountains on limiting gene flow and population exchange. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the possibility of recombination in some of the studied subpopulations in both provinces.

AB Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat and imposes a constant challenge on wheat breeders. Xiaohongpi, a Chinese landrace of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), shows resistance to powdery mildew during the entire growth stage in the field and under controlled conditions. The F-1 plants from cross of the powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Yangmai158 with Xiaohongpi were susceptible to isolate Bgt19, the locally most prevalent Bgt isolate. In the derived F-2 population and F-3 progenies, the resistance segregation deviated significantly from the one-gene Mendelian ratio. However, marker analysis indicated that only one recessive gene conferred the resistance, which co-segregated with Xsts-bcd1231 that showed co-segregation with Pm4a in different studies. Allelism test indicated that this recessive resistance gene, designated as pmX, is either allelic or tightly linked to Pm4a. The pmX gene was different from Pm4 alleles in resistance spectrum. Examination of the genotype frequencies at pmX and the linked marker loci in the F-2 population showed that a genetic variation favoring the transmission of Xiaohongpi alleles could be the cause of deviated segregation. Mapping of the pmX-linked markers using Chinese Spring deletion lines indicated that it resides in the 0.85-1.00 bin of chromosome 2AL.

AB The discovery of several new loci for resistance to Hessian fly was reported here. QHf.uga-6AL, the late HR61 was recognized from wheat cultivar 26R61 on the distal end of 6AL with resistance to both biotypes E and vH13. It is the first gene or QTL found on this particular chromosome. QHf.uga-3DL and QHf.uga-1AL, physically assigned to the deletion bins 3DL2-0.27-0.81 and 1AL1-0.17-0.61, respectively, were detected for resistance to biotype vH13. Both QTL should represent new loci for Hessian fly resistance and the latter was detectable only in the late seedling stage when tolerance was evident. In addition, QHf.uga-6DS-C and QHf.uga-1AS had minor effect and were identified from the susceptible parent AGS 2000 for resistance to biotype E and vH13, respectively. QHf.uga-6DS-C is different from the known gene H13 on 6DS and QHf.uga-1AS is different from H9 gene cluster on 1AS. These loci also might be new components of Hessian fly resistance, although their LOD values were not highly significant. The QTL detections were all conducted on a RIL mapping population of 26R61/AGS 2000 with good genome coverage of molecular markers. The strategy used in the current study will serve as a good starting point for the discovery and mapping of resistance genes including tolerance to the pest and the closely linked markers will certainly be useful in selecting or pyramiding of these loci in breeding programs.

AB Plant regeneration from immature embryos of 15 Indian barley genotypes (Hordeum vulgare L.) was examined. Highest percent callus induction and number of regenerated plantlets were obtained in cultivars BL 2 (94.4 %; 12.1), RD 2668 (92.6 %; 9.1) and RD 2552 (90.8 %; 7.8). The highly responding cultivar BL 2 was selected for further development of transformation protocol. The plasmid DNA isolated from pCAMBIA1381 harbouring hptII gene as selectable marker and gusA gene as reporter was used. Particle bombardment was used for transformation of immature embryos and regeneration of transgenic plants in Indian barley genotype for the first time. Transformation experiments were carried out using different parameters and optimum conditions for DNA delivery was standardized. The transient expression of gusA gene was investigated as a preliminary test of optimum DNA delivery and for selecting the most appropriate bombardment parameters. The optimum conditions were: gold microparticles (diameter 1.0 mu m) shot with 1,100 psi rupture disc pressure. The 3 cm distance between rupture disk and macrocarrier and 9 cm target tissue distance yielded high transient GUS expression. The immature embryos were bombarded twice to increase area for efficient gene delivery. Osmotic medium optimization with 0.4 M sorbitol and preculture of immature embryos for 5 days prior to bombardment resulted into efficient gene transfer in barley. Selection of transformed tissue was performed after 7 days resting step on selection medium containing 50 mg l(-1) hygromycin. After two more selection steps, green shoots were rooted on MSB5 medium with 50 mg l(-1) hygromycin. PCR analysis using primers specific for hptII and gusA genes and Southern blot analysis with hptII probes confirmed the stable integration of transgene in barley genome. Molecular analysis of T-1 generation plantlets revealed the amplification of selectable marker hptII gene in the progeny.

TI Virulence of Puccinia triticina in Turkey and leaf rust resistance in
   Turkish wheat cultivars
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Gene postulation; Brown rust
AB Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is a common disease on wheat in the coastal regions of Turkey. Collections of P. triticina from infected wheat leaves were obtained from the main wheat production zones of Turkey in 2009 and 2010. A total of 104 single uredinial isolates were tested for virulence on 20 lines of Thatcher wheat that differ for single leaf rust resistance genes. Forty-four different virulence phenotypes were identified over both years. Four phenotypes were found in both years. Phenotype FHPTQ found in 2009, with virulence to genes Lr2c, Lr3, Lr16, Lr26, Lr3ka, Lr17a, Lr30, LrB, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr18, Lr3bg, and Lr14b, was the most common phenotype at 15.4 % of the total isolates. Forty-three winter and spring wheat cultivars from Turkey were tested as seedlings with 13 different P. triticina virulence phenotypes from Canada, the US and Turkey. The infection types on the cultivars were compared with infection types on the Thatcher near isogenic lines to postulate the presence of seedling leaf rust resistance genes in the cultivars. Resistance genes Lr1, Lr3a, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr17a, Lr20, Lr23, and Lr26 were postulated to be present in the Turkish wheat cultivars. DNA of the wheat cultivars was tested with PCR markers to determine the presence of the adult plant resistance genes Lr34 and Lr37. Marker data indicated the presence of Lr34 in 20 cultivars and Lr37 in three cultivars. Field plot evaluations of the wheat cultivars indicated that no single Lr gene conditioned highly effective leaf rust resistance. Resistant cultivars varied for combinations of seedling and adult plant resistance genes.

AB Background: Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic) is cultivated as a pasture legume for its high protein content and ability to improve soils through nitrogen fixation. Toxic concentrations of the micronutrient Boron (B) in agricultural soils hamper the production of cereal and leguminous crops. In cereals, the genetic analysis of B tolerance has led to the development of molecular selection tools to introgress and maintain the B tolerance trait in breeding lines. There is a comparable need for selection tools in legumes that grow on these toxic soils, often in rotation with cereals.
   Results: Genetic variation for B tolerance in Medicago truncatula was utilised to generate two F-2 populations from crosses between tolerant and intolerant parents. Phenotyping under B stress revealed a close correlation between B tolerance and biomass production and a segregation ratio explained by a single dominant locus. M. truncatula homologues of the Arabidopsis major intrinsic protein (MIP) gene AtNIP5;1 and the efflux-type transporter gene AtBOR1, both known for B transport, were identified and nearby molecular markers screened across F-2 lines to verify linkage with the B-tolerant phenotype. Most (95%) of the phenotypic variation could be explained by the SSR markers h2_6e22a and h2_21b19a, which flank a cluster of five predicted MIP genes on chromosome 4. Three CAPS markers (MtBtol-1,-2,-3) were developed to dissect the region further. Expression analysis of the five predicted MIPs indicated that only MtNIP3 was expressed when leaf tissue and roots were assessed. MtNIP3 showed low and equal expression in the roots of tolerant and intolerant lines but a 4-fold higher expression level in the leaves of B-tolerant cultivars. The expression profile correlates closely with the B concentration measured in the leaves and roots of tolerant and intolerant plants. Whereas no significant difference in B concentration exists between roots of tolerant and intolerant plants, the B concentration in the leaves of tolerant plants is less than half that of intolerant plants, which further supports MtNIP3 as the best candidate for the tolerance trait-defining gene in Medicago truncatula.
   Conclusion: The close linkage of the MtNIP3 locus to B toxicity tolerance provides a source of molecular selection tools to pasture breeding programs. The economical importance of the locus warrants further investigation of the individual members of the MIP gene cluster in other pasture and in grain legumes.

AB Aliphatic glucosinolates are the predominant sulfur-rich plant secondary metabolites in economically important Brassica crops. Glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products are involved in plant-microbe, plantinsect, plant-animal, and plant-human interactions. It is, therefore, important to manipulate glucosinolate profiles and contents in Brassica species. In this study, aliphatic glucosinolates were genetically manipulated through homoeologous recombination in backcross lines followed by marker assisted selection in B. rapa. A resynthesized B. napus line, from a cross between B. rapa and B. oleracea, was backcrossed with Chinese cabbage doubled haploid line, RI16. Marker assisted selection for non-functional gene was performed in each backcross generations. Advanced backcross progenies (BC3F2) were developed to identify homoeologous gene replacement and/or introgression. Reduction in 5C aliphatic glucosinolates (gluconapoleiferin, glucoalyssin, and glucobrassicanapin) was observed in BC3F2 progenies of the recurrent parent that carried the GSL-ELONG(-) gene. The GSL-ELONG(-) positive backcross progenies were also screened by the A-genome and BraGSL-ELONG gene specific marker, which linked with 5C aliphatic glucosinolates. The A-genome specific marker was absent in the plants of advanced backcross progenies which showed reduction in 5C aliphatic glucosinolates. The results suggest that the functional allele had been replaced by the non-functional GSL-ELONG(-) allele from B. oleracea. Some advanced backcross progenies (BC3F2) positive for the GSL-ELONG(-) allele and the A-genome specific SCAR marker BraMAM1-1 did not show reduction in 5C aliphatic glucosinolates, suggesting that GSL-ELONG(-) allele is recessive. Replacement of the functional locus in the A-genome by non-functional counterpart in the C-genome reduced the content of 5C aliphatic glucosinolates in B. rapa seeds with 20 mu mol/g.

AB The Yr26 gene, conferring resistance to all currently important races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) in China, was previously mapped to wheat chromosome deletion bin C-1BL-6-0.32 with low-density markers. In this study, collinearity of wheat to Brachypodium distachyon and rice was used to develop markers to saturate the chromosomal region containing the Yr26 locus, and a total of 2,341 F-2 plants and 551 F2: 3 progenies derived from Avocet Sx92R137 were used to develop a fine map of Yr26. Wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in deletion bin C-1BL-6-0.32 were used to develop sequence tagged site (STS) markers. The EST-STS markers flanking Yr26 were used to identify collinear regions of the rice and B. distachyon genomes. Wheat ESTs with significant similarities in the two collinear regions were selected to develop conserved markers for fine mapping of Yr26. Thirty-one markers were mapped to the Yr26 region, and six of them cosegregated with the resistance gene. Marker orders were highly conserved between rice and B. distachyon, but some rearrangements were observed between rice and wheat. Two flanking markers (CON-4 and CON-12) further narrowed the genomic region containing Yr26 to a 1.92 Mb region in B. distachyon chromosome 3 and a 1.17 Mb region in rice chromosome 10, and two putative resistance gene analogs were identified in the collinear region of B. distachyon. The markers developed in this study provide a potential target site for further map-based cloning of Yr26 and should be useful in marker assisted selection for pyramiding the gene with other resistance genes.

   wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum L.); Association mapping
ID GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HORDEUM; WHEAT; QTLS
AB Background: Grain protein content (GPC) is an important quality determinant for barley used as malt, feed as well as food. It is controlled by a complex genetic system. GPC differs greatly among barley genotypes and is also variable across different environments. It is imperative to understand the genetic control of barley GPC and identify the genotypes with less variation under the different environments.
   Results: In this study, 59 cultivated and 99 Tibetan wild barley genotypes were used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a multi-platform candidate gene-based association analysis, in order to identify the molecular markers associated with GPC. Tibetan wild barley had higher GPC than cultivated barley. The significant correlation between GPC and diastatic power (DP), and malt extract confirmed the importance of GPC in determining malt quality. Diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers associated with barley GPC were detected by GWAS. In addition, GWAS revealed two HvNAM genes as the candidate genes controlling GPC. No association was detected between HvNAM1 polymorphism and GPC, while a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (798, P < 0.01), located within the second intron of HvNAM2, was associated with GPC. There was a significant correlation between haplotypes of HvNAM1, HvNAM2 and GPC in barley.
   Conclusions: The GWAS and candidate gene based-association study may be effectively used to determine the genetic variation of GPC in barley. The DArT markers and the polymorphism of HvNAM genes identified in this study are useful in developing high quality barley cultivars in the future. HvNAM genes could play a role in controlling barley GPC.

AB Species in the Brassica genus including B. rapa, B. oleracea, and B. napus are cultivated widely around the World as edible vegetables and for their oils. Although progress has been made in identifying molecular markers among Brassica species, expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have not been applied in the analysis of Brassica species for gene or quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. In the present work, 25,631 EST-SSRs were identified among 1,017,392 Brassica ESTs. These SSR-motifs averaged 25 bp in length. Tri-nucleotide SSRs were the most abundant. Among these, AGG/CCT was the dominant motif, accounting for 25% of the total. A total of 20,683 primer pairs were designed successfully. Some of the primer pairs (3,262) from B. napus and B. oleracea were then transferred successfully to B. rapa for comparative sequence analysis and PCR amplification.

AB A segregating population from the cross between drought sensitive (Variant-2) and drought tolerant (Cham-6) genotypes was made to identify molecular markers linked to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flag leaf senescence under water-stress. From 38 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers, 25 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers and 46 simple sequence repeat (SRR) primers, tested for polymorphism among parental genotypes and F2 population. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flag leaf senescence was associated with 1 RAPD marker (Pr9), 4 ISSR markers (Pr8, AD5, AD2 and AD3), and 1 SSR marker (Xgwm382) and explained 44, 50, 35, 31, 22 and 73 % phenotypic variation, respectively. The genetic distance between flag leaf senescence gene and Pr9 was 10.0 cM (LOD score 22.9). The markers Pr8, AD5, AD2 and AD3 had genetic distances of 10.5, 14.6, 15.6 and 18.1 cM, respectively (LOD scores 22.6, 17.8, 17.5 and 14.6). The genetic distance between Xgwm382 was 3.9 cM (LOD score 33.8). Therefore, the RAPD, ISSR and SSR markers linked to the QTL for the drought-induced flag leaf senescence can be further used in breeding for drought tolerance in wheat.

AB A PCR-based system has been developed for highly specific identification of the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium cerealis on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the phosphate permease gene. Sequencing and the following analysis showed that this gene demonstrated a high degree of polymorphism and can be used for both phylogenetic studies and as a marker for specific primer design. Investigation of the specificity of the designed primers confirmed the lack of cross-reactivity with DNA of closely related fungi species of the Fusarium genus. The qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity of the test system, which was 10 pg of the specific DNA per reaction.

AB Consistent grain yield in drought environment has attracted wide attention due to global climate change. However, the important drought-related traits/genes in crops have been rarely reported. Many near-isogenic lines (NILs) of male sterile and fertile Salvia miltiorrhiza have been obtained in our previous work through testcross and backcross in continuous field experiments conducted in 2006-2009. Both segregating sterile and fertile populations were subjected to bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) with 384 and 170 primer combinations, respectively. One out of 14 AFLP markers (E9/M3(246)) was identified in treated fertile population as tightly linked to the drought stress gene with a recombination frequency of 6.98% and at a distance of 7.02 cM. One of 15 other markers (E2/M5(357)) was identified in a treated sterile population that is closely associated with the drought stress gene. It had a recombination frequency of 4.65% and at a distance of 4.66 cM. Interestingly, the E9/M3(246) fragment was found to be identical to another AFLP fragment E11/M4(208) that was tightly linked to the male sterile gene of S. miltiorrhiza with 95% identity and e-value 4 x 10(-93). Blastn analysis suggested that the drought stress gene sequence showed higher identity with nucleotides in Arabidopsis chromosome 1-5.

AB Exogenous fragment sequence and flanking sequence between exogenous fragment and recombinant chromosome of transgenic wheat B72-8-11b were successfully acquired through PCR amplification with cross-matched primers from exogenous genes. Newly acquired exogenous fragment covered the full-length sequence of transformed genes such as transformed plasmid and corresponding functional genes including marker uidA, promoter ubiquitin, lacZ, 1Dx5, and part of sequence of the wheat genome. A specific PCR detection method for transgenic wheat B72-8-11b strain was established on the basis of primers designed according to flanking sequence. The designed primers revealed specific amplification of 132 bp product of transgenic wheat B72-8-11b strain. This method is characteristics of high specificity, high reproducibility, rapid identification, and excellent accuracy for the identification of transgenic wheat B72-8-11b strain.

AB Stem rust of wheat, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, was under control worldwide for over 30 years by utilizing genetic resistance. The emergence of stem rust in 1998 in eastern Africa in form of race Ug99 and its evolving variants with virulence to many resistance genes were recognized as potential threats to wheat production. In this study we identified genomic regions contributing to putatively durable, adult plant resistance (APR) to wheat stem rust. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 298 lines was previously developed at CIMMYT from a cross between 'Avocet S' and 'Pavon 76'. Pavon 76 has been described to carry APR to stem rust. Avocet S carries the race-specific resistance gene Sr26. A subset of RILs without Sr26 segregated for APR to stem rust race Ug99 when evaluated in Kenya for three years. Single year and joint year analysis by inclusive composite interval mapping using 450 DArT markers identified five quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contributed to the resistance of wheat to stem rust race Ug99. Three of these, including QSr.cim-3B, which probably represents the Sr2 gene, were contributed by Pavon 76 whereas the remaining two QTL were contributed by Avocet S. QSr.cim-3B, or putatively Sr2, on chromosome arm 3BS explained 32 % of the phenotypic variation while the additional QTL in Pavon contributed 24 and 20 %, respectively. Two QTL from Avocet S explained 8 and 6 % of phenotypic variance, respectively. A combination of APR QTL from the two parents resulted in transgressive segregants expressing higher levels of resistance than Pavon 76. Our results indicate that it is possible to accumulate several minor resistance genes each with a small to intermediate effect resulting in a variety that exhibits negligible disease levels even under high stem rust pressure.

AB A temporarily designated gene LrARK12c (identified from spelt wheat cv. Altgold Rotkorn) with an intermediate low infection type was found effective against prevalent Australian Puccinia triticina (Pt) pathotypes. The gene was mapped to chromosome 1B between markers Xgwm18 and Xbarc187, with linkage distances of 1.0 and 1.3 cM, respectively. While it was not possible to assign a definitive chromosomal arm location to LrARK12c, it maps close to the centromere based on physical mapping of SSR marker loci using deletion lines. Other genes conferring resistance to Pt in chromosome 1B include Lr33, Lr44 and Lr46. Genetic analysis showed that LrARK12c and Lr44 are genetically independent. Comparisons of markers linked to LrARK12c and Lr46 indicate that Lr46 should be well distal to the centromere. Lr33 is not effective in the seedling stage with Australian Pt pathotypes, therefore question of possible allelism of LrARK12c and Lr33 cannot be resolved using Australian Pt pathotypes. Genetic studies, chromosome mapping and allelism tests indicated that LrARK12c is a new and genetically independent leaf rust resistance locus, and hence it was designated Lr71 in accordance with the rules of wheat gene nomenclature.

AB Reduced height genes are the genetic basis of the "green revolution". Two agronomically important gibberellic acid (GA)-insensitive genes, Rht-B1b (Rht1) and Rht-D1b (Rht2), localised on chromosomes 4BS and 4DS, respectively, and the GA-responsive gene Rht8, localised on chromosome 2DS, were introduced into many cultivars worldwide. An alternative GA-insensitive gene Rht-B1e (=Rht11) was introduced into Russian wheat cultivars. In this study, we investigated the importance of Rht-B1b, Rht-B1e, Rht-D1b and Rht8 in south Russian bread wheat cultivars. The cultivars were divided into five groups: (1) Rht8c; (2) Rht-B1b; (3) Rht-B1b, Rht8; (4) Rht-B1e, Rht8; and (5) Rht-D1b, Rht8. In the Krasnodar region of south Russia 3,222,321 ha were evaluated for estimating the commercial value of each of these genes in 2009-2011. The results showed that coupling Rht-B1e with Rht8 or Rht-B1b with Rht8 was more successful compared with the effects of other genes or their combinations. The average yield of cultivars carrying Rht-B1e exceeded the average yield of cultivars from the other groups. Our study demonstrates that Rht-B1e can be recommended for use in breeding programs and the presence of a molecular marker for this allele simplifies its transfer to elite wheat germplasm.

AB Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is one of the most destructive foliar diseases in many of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) growing regions of the world. Gene Stb2, derived from cultivar 'Veranopolis', provides effective resistance against STB. In our attempts to refine the map location of this resistance gene we could not confirm a previous report that Stb2 is on wheat chromosome 3BS. Instead, based on characterization of the same doubled-haploid population used for the original mapping derived from a cross between Veranopolis and susceptible line RAC875-2, and linkage analysis of the resistance phenotype to previously mapped SSR loci, we report that Stb2 is located on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1B, flanked by microsatellite loci Xwmc406 and Xbarc008 (with Xwmc230 closely located) at map distances of 6 and 5 cM, respectively. Presence of the markers on chromosome arm 1BS was confirmed by analysis of nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. These three co-dominant markers can be used in wheat breeding programs to facilitate combining Stb2 with genes of interest. Other STB resistance genes, including Stb11, have been reported on wheat chromosome arm 1BS, with locus Xbarc008 as a diagnostic marker. Whether Stb2, Stb11 and the previously identified Stb11-like genes are the same, allelic, or different but closely linked has not been determined. In addition to STB, numerous genes for resistance to many other fungal pathogens have been reported on wheat chromosome arm 1BS, including those for yellow (or stripe) rust, leaf rust and common bunt. The approximate locations for all of these genes were added onto the Stb2 map based on published distances from common markers to provide a rough guide for future wheat improvement.

AB Variation of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in 28 Iranian Aegilops tauschii (2n = 2x = 14, DD) accessions studied by sodium dodecyl sulphate electrophoresis method (SDS-PAGE). The results showed high variation of HMW-GS in the accessions. The range of frequency in 14 HMW-GS combinations was 3.57-25 % in the accessions. AMOVA showed the molecular variance between the geographic areas was lower than within the geographic areas. According to Nei's genetic diversity, the highest diversity levels were in Semnan, Golestan and Azarbayjan, on the other hand the lowest levels of diversity were found in Khorasan, Gilan and Mazandaran accessions. Hence, the Caspian Sea South East accessions also Azerbayjan in Iran have more diversity. AMOVA did not show variance between strangulata and tauschii but there was more genetic diversity in ssp. tauschii subspecies in comparison of ssp. strangulata according to Nei's gene diversity and Shannon information index. It showed Iranian Ae. tauschii have a good potential for bread making quality improvement in bread wheat.

AB Beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENNs) are cyclic peptide mycotoxins produced by a wide range of fungal species, including pathogenic Fusaria. Amounts of BEA and ENNs were quantified in individual rice cultures of 58 Fusarium strains belonging to 20 species, originating from different host plant species and different geographical localities. The species identification of all strains was done on the basis of the tef-1 alpha gene sequence. The main aim of this study was to analyze the variability of the esyn1 gene encoding the enniatin synthase, the essential enzyme of this metabolic pathway, among the BEA- and ENNs-producing genotypes. The phylogenetic analysis based on the partial sequence of the esyn1 gene clearly discriminates species producing exclusively BEA from those synthesizing mainly enniatin analogues.

AB The wheat curl mite (WCM) is a major pest in cereal crops around the world and the vector of at least four known pathogens capable of reducing yields in crops such as wheat, corn, barley, oats, millet and rye. Current taxonomy recognizes WCM as a single species, Aceria tosichella; however, recent genetic, physiological and ecological studies have shown that WCM is likely to be a species complex. In this study we assessed genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships among WCM from four continents and a wide range of host plants using DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial gene, one nuclear gene and a single nuclear intergenic spacer region. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 11 unique mite lineages associated with specific plant hosts including wheat and barley. Host associations were consistent across continents, often with a single haplotype dominating a host plant regardless of geographic origin. The genetic and ecological differences identified in this study support the notion that WCM is a species complex in need of major taxonomic revision. These findings have implications for control of WCM globally, particularly within the context of identifying plants that form 'green bridge' refuges, assessing disease transmission risk, and identifying resistance in cereal genotypes to WCM and associated pathogens.

AB In the present study, we analyze the genetic structure and diversity among accessions of popcorn obtained from the CIMMYT International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center that represent the diversity available for current use by breeding programs. The main objectives were to identify SSR loci that were the best indicators of genetic diversity, to measure the genetic diversity within popcorn genotypes, and to analyze the genetic structure of the promising populations destined for use in breeding programs. The mean gene diversity of all SSR loci was 0.6352. An extremely high population differentiation level was detected (F (st) = 0.3152) with F (st) for each locus ranging from 0.1125 (Umc1229) to 0.4870 (Umc1755). Analyzing the genetic structure of eight popcorn accessions was especially important for identifying both SSR loci with high levels of heterozygosity and genotypes showing high heterozygosity (Boya462 and Arzm13 050). This analysis should be the medium and long-term selection goal for the generation of inbred lines and the future production of new cultivars. Plant accessions Arzm05 083, Arzm13 050, and Urug298 may also be useful varieties that exhibit important agronomic characteristics that can be used through crosses to broaden the genetic basis of popcorn.

AB Yield potential and stability improvement with the goal of ensuring global food security is an important priority. Yield has a quantitative nature and is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL) and environmental factors. An increasingly large number of maize yield QTL have been identified, and how to integrate and re-analyze them is challenging. To this end, we tried to combine QTL meta-analysis with homology-based cloning techniques to dissect candidate loci/genes for maize yield. We first collected maize yield-related QTL from public resources. Then, 351 collected QTL were iteratively projected and meta-analyzed to obtain metaQTL (MQTL). A total of 54 MQTL were identified and tended to cluster in the maize genome. Seven MQTL containing ten maize orthologs of rice yield genes were dissected and temporarily termed syntenic MQTL. Maize orthologs of three functionally-characterized rice yield genes, GIF1, WFP/IPA1, and DEP1, were specially selected to undergo phylogenetic, proliferation, and selective pattern analysis. The results showed that maize orthologs were closely related to rice yield genes and subjected to mixed selective pressures, including positive selection during selective sweeps. The power of the combined techniques reported here was primarily validated not only by the congruency of MQTL and recently reported maize yield QTL but also by mined syntenic MQTL containing the well-characterized Miniature1 (Mn1) gene for maize kernel size and weight determination. Maize MQTL, especially syntenic MQTL regions, could serve not only for QTL fine-mapping and cloning but also for the marker-assisted selection breeding program. The maize yield candidate loci/genes presented here also deserve further investigation and will provide clues to the molecular bases of grain yield. Additionally, the combined technique described here will find its way into further quantitative trait research.

AB Leaf rust is a widespread and commonly occurring rust disease of wheat. Genetic resistance is the most economical method of reducing losses due to leaf rust. Lr15 has been shown to be present on wheat chromosome 2D and is reported to be a seedling resistance gene. However, tightly linked markers associated with Lr15 have not been reported to date. To identify molecular markers linked to Lr15, an F-2 mapping population of Thatcher x Thatcher-Lr15 was generated. Available wheat simple sequence repeat markers were utilized in parental screening and polymorphic markers were used to analyze the entire population of 221 plants. Phenotypic evaluations of the F-2-derived F-3 progenies with Puccinia triticina Eriks. pathotype 162A (93R15) confirmed the monogenic inheritance of Lr15. The linkage group representing chromosome 2DS was constructed at LOD 4.0 which revealed the closest flanking markers Xgwm4562 and Xgwm102 at a distance of 3.1 and 9.3 cM, respectively. Furthermore, utilization of these flanking markers in combination has successfully identified wheat lines with or without Lr15. These markers could potentially be useful in gene pyramiding with other genes to enhance rust resistance in wheat.

Following emergence of Ug99, the new virulent race of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici in Africa, a global effort for identification and utilization of new sources of Ug99-resistant germplasm has been undertaken. In this study, we conducted replicated experiments to evaluate the resistance of Iranian wheat germplasm to the TTKSK lineage of the Ug99 race of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. We also evaluated for presence of stem rust resistance genes (i.e., Sr2, Sr24, Sr26, Sr38, Sr39, Sr31, and Sr1RS(Amigo)) in wheat cultivars and breeding lines widely cultivated in Iran. Our phenotyping data revealed high levels of susceptibility to Ug99 in Iranian bread wheat germplasm. Our genotyping data revealed that Iranian cultivars do not carry Sr24, Sr26, or Sr1RS(Amigo). Only a few salt-tolerant cultivars and breeding lines tested positively for Sr2, Sr31, Sr38, or Sr39 markers. In conclusion, the genetic basis for resistance to Ug99 in Iranian wheat cultivars was found to be vulnerable. Acquiring knowledge about existing resistance genes and haplotypes in wheat cultivars and breeding lines will help breeders, cereal pathologists, and policy makers to select and pyramid effective stem rust resistance genes.

AB Troch, V., Audenaert, K., Vanheule, A., Bekaert, B., Hate, M., and Haesaert, G. 2013. Evaluation of resistance to powdery mildew in triticale seedlings and adult plants. Plant Dis. 97:410-417. Triticale (xTriticosecale) is the intergeneric hybrid between the female parent wheat and the male parent rye. With the expansion of the triticale growing area, powdery mildew emerged on this new host and has become a significant disease on triticale. Recent research demonstrated that this "new" powdery mildew on triticale has emerged through a host range expansion of powdery mildew of wheat. Moreover, this expansion occurred recently and multiple times at different locations in Europe. An effective and environmentally sensitive approach to controlling powdery mildew involves breeding crop plants for resistance. The main goal of this study was to identify the presence of powdery mildew resistance in commercial triticale cultivars. First, the avirulence (AVR) genes and gene complexity carried by this new powdery mildew population on triticale were characterized. Virulence was identified for all the resistance genes evaluated in the present study, and virulence frequencies higher than 50% were recorded on the genes Pm3f, Pm5b, Pm6, Pm7, Pm8, and Pm17. Using molecular markers, the presence of resistance genes Pm3f and Pm17 was identified in certain triticale cultivars. The triticale cultivars were also evaluated for the presence of quantitative resistance at adult plant growth stages in a 2-year field experiment. Despite the high disease pressure, cultivars highly resistant at the adult-plant growth stages were identified. Because 'Grenado' also showed effective race-specific resistance, this cultivar could be of high value for breeding for durable resistance to powdery mildew. Altogether, this study reveals valuable information on the presence of powdery mildew resistance in commercial triticale cultivars, which can be used in breeding programs in triticale. Additionally, this study underscores the need to broaden the base of powdery mildew resistance in triticale through introgression and deployment of new sources of mildew resistance, including quantitative resistance.

AB Modern wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties in Western Europe have mainly been bred, and selected in conditions where high levels of nitrogen-rich fertilizer are applied. However, high input crop management has greatly increased the risk of nitrates leaching into groundwater with negative impacts on the environment. To investigate wheat nitrogen tolerance characteristics that could be adapted to low input crop management, we supplied 196 accessions of a wheat core collection of old and modern cultivars with high or moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer in an experimental network consisting of three sites and 2 years. The main breeding traits were assessed including grain yield and grain protein content. The response to nitrogen level was estimated for grain yield and grain number per m(2) using both the difference and the ratio between performance at the two input levels and the slope of joint regression. A large variability was observed for all the traits studied and the response to nitrogen level. Whole genome association mapping was carried out using 899 molecular markers taking into account the five ancestral group structure of the collection. We identified 54 main regions involving almost all chromosomes that influence yield and its components, plant height, heading date and grain protein concentration. Twenty-three regions, including several genes, spread over 16 chromosomes were involved in the response to nitrogen level. These chromosomal regions may be good candidates to be used in breeding programs to improve the performance of wheat varieties at moderate nitrogen input levels.

AB We developed an efficient Agrobacterium -mediated transformation method using an Ac/Ds transposon tagging construct for F. vesca and high throughput paromomycin spray assay to identify its transformants for strawberry functional genomics.
   Genomic resources for Rosaceae species are now readily available, including the Fragaria vesca genome, EST sequences, markers, linkage maps, and physical maps. The Rosaceae Genomic Executive Committee has promoted strawberry as a translational genomics model due to its unique biological features and transformability for fruit trait improvement. Our overall research goal is to use functional genomic and metabolic approaches to pursue high throughput gene discovery in the diploid woodland strawberry. F. vesca offers several advantages of a fleshy fruit typical of most fruit crops, short life cycle (seed to seed in 12-16 weeks), small genome size (206 Mbb/C), small plant size, self-compatibility, and many seeds per plant. We have developed an efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated strawberry transformation method using kanamycin selection, and high throughput paromomycin spray assay to efficiently identify transgenic strawberry plants. Using our kanamycin transformation method, we were able to produce up to 98 independent kanamycin resistant insertional mutant lines using a T-DNA construct carrying an Ac/Ds transposon Launchpad system from a single transformation experiment involving inoculation of 22 leaf explants of F. vesca accession 551572 within approx. 11 weeks (from inoculation to soil). Transgenic plants with 1-2 copies of a transgene were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Using our paromomycin spray assay, transgenic F. vesca plants were rapidly identified within 10 days after spraying.

AB Abiotic stress conditions are the main limiting factors for crop cultivation around the world. In the present study we aimed to improve wheat growth under drought stress conditions through priming with beneficial bacteria considered as plant-growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). Two bacterial strains, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 5113 and Azospirillum brasilense NO40, were used to prime the wheat cv. Sids1. To generate drought stress for 12-day-old seedlings, water was withheld for 4, 5, or 7 days while growth and survival were recorded. Furthermore, several stress markers were examined by molecular and biochemical assays to study the role of priming on different stress tolerance mechanisms. Priming significantly alleviated the deleterious effect of drought stress on wheat. Drought resulted in the upregulation of some stress-related genes (APX1, SAMS1, and HSP17.8) in the leaves and increased activity of enzymes involved in the plant ascorbate-glutathione redox cycle. Bacteria-treated plants showed attenuated transcript levels suggesting improved homeostatic mechanisms due to priming. The present study reports on the ability of certain PGPB to attenuate several stress consequences in plants which strongly supports the potential of such an approach to control drought stress in wheat.

AB In order to identify genes responsible for starch granule initiation during early development of wheat caryopsis, nine winter wheat breeding lines were studied. Two breeding lines, which are the most diverse in A-type granule size (26.85 mu m versus 23.65 mu m) were chosen for further differential gene expression analysis in developing caryopses at 10 and 15 days post-anthesis (DPA). cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) analysis resulted in 384 transcript-derived fragments, out of which 18 were identified as being differentially expressed. Six differentially expressed genes, together with the six well-known starch biosynthesis genes, were chosen for semi-quantitative gene expression analysis in developing wheat caryopses at 10 and 15 DPA. This study provides genomic information on 18 genes differentially expressed at early stages of wheat caryopses development and reports on the identification of genes putatively involved in the production of large A-type granules. These genes are targets for further validation on their role in starch granule synthesis control and provide the basis for the development of DNA marker tools in winter wheat breeding for enhanced starch quality.

AB A total of 358 recent European winter wheat varieties plus 14 spring wheat varieties were evaluated for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum in four separate environments. The FHB scores based on FHB incidence (Type I resistance) x FHB severity (Type II resistance) indicated a wide phenotypic variation of the varieties with BLUE (best linear unbiased estimation) values ranging from 0.07 to 33.67. Genotyping with 732 microsatellite markers resulted in 782 loci of which 620 were placed on the ITMI map. The resulting average marker distance of 6.8 cM allowed genome wide association mapping employing a mixed model. Though no clear population structure was discovered, a kinship matrix was used for stratification. A total of 794 significant (-log(10)(p)-value >= 3.0) associations between SSR-loci and environment-specific FHB scores or BLUE values were detected, which included 323 SSR alleles. For FHB incidence and FHB severity a total of 861 and 877 individual marker-trait associations (MTA) were detected, respectively. Associations for both traits co-located with FHB score in most cases. Consistent associations detected in three or more environments were found on all chromosomes except chromosome 6B, and with the highest number of MTA on chromosome 5B. The dependence of the number of favourable and unfavourable alleles within a variety to the respective FHB scores indicated an additive effect of favourable and unfavourable alleles, i.e. genotypes with more favourable or less unfavourable alleles tended to show greater resistance to FHB. Assessment of a marker specific for the dwarfing gene Rht-D1 resulted in strong effects. The results provide a prerequisite for designing genome wide breeding strategies for FHB resistance.

AB Historical and local varieties are an important source of genetic diversity in connection with the wheat baking quality. By analysis of DNA from the coding part of the genome of the Slovak regional wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety 'Trebiovska 76', differences in the Dy subunit composition coded by locus Glu-1D were found. Comparing the newly found sequence with a generally used 1Dy12 (GenBank accession no. X03041) sequence, existence of a new high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit, which was marked as 1Dy12* (GenBank accession no. EU266533) was confirmed. The molecular weight of probable protein coded by 1Dy12* subunit reaches 72.35 kDa comparing to the 1Dy12, which reaches 68.71 kDa. This difference is not likely to distinguish by SDS-PAGE. The easiest way for cereal genotyping according to baking quality is proteomic analysis. More exact and suitable method for genotype identification appears to be marker assisted selection using PCR.

AB Soilborne pathogens such as cereal cyst nematode (CCN; Heterodera avenae) and root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus neglectus; PN) cause substantial yield losses in the major cereal-growing regions of the world. Incorporating resistance into wheat cultivars and breeding lines is considered the most cost-effective control measure for reducing nematode populations. To identify loci with molecular markers linked to genes conferring resistance to these pathogens, we employed a genome-wide association approach in which 332 synthetic hexaploid wheat lines previously screened for resistance to CCN and PN were genotyped with 660 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. Two sequence-tagged site markers reportedly linked to genes known to confer resistance to CCN were also included in the analysis. Using the mixed linear model corrected for population structure and familial relatedness (Q+K matrices), we were able to confirm previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to CCN and PN in bi-parental crosses. In addition, we identified other significant markers located in chromosome regions where no CCN and PN resistance genes have been reported. Seventeen DArT marker loci were found to be significantly associated with CCN and twelve to PN resistance. The novel QTL on chromosomes 1D, 4D, 5B, 5D and 7D for resistance to CCN and 4A, 5B and 7B for resistance to PN are suggested to represent new sources of genes which could be deployed in further wheat improvement against these two important root diseases of wheat.

AB There is concern over the sustainability and environmental impact of mineral fertilisers and crop protection inputs used in intensive arable crop production systems. However, replacing mineral with organic fertilisers (animal and green manures) and restricting the use of chemosynthetic crop protection may significantly reduce crop yields. The effects of (a) replacing mineral with composted cattle manure fertiliser input and (b) omitting pesticide-based crop protection on potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yield, leaf and tuber mineral nutrient content and leaf protein profiles were investigated. Switching to organic fertiliser had a greater effect on yield and protein profiles than the omission of chemosynthetic crop protection. Leaf N and P composition were significant drivers of protein expression, particularly proteins involved in photosynthesis such as the large subunit of RuBisCO, RuBisCO activase and the photosystem I reaction centre, which were at higher abundances in potato leaves grown under mineral fertiliser regimes. Proteins known to be induced in response to stress, such as dehydroascorbate reductase and Glutathione S-transferases, were also shown to be up-regulated under mineral fertilisation, possibly associated with higher Cd composition, whereas two proteins known to be involved in biotic stress (1,3-beta-d-glucan glucanohydrolase; putative Kunitz-type tuber invertase inhibitor) were more abundant under compost fertilisation. Results showed that switching from mineral to organic fertilisers led to reduced N availability, a significant change in leaf protein expression and lower tuber yield. In contrast, omission of chemosynthetic crop protection inputs had limited effects on protein expression and no significant effect on tuber yield. This study provides information on the effects of changes in nutrient supply on protein expression patterns. It is a prerequisite for the development of functional molecular markers for a directed strategy to inform breeding programmes to improve potato nutrient use efficiency.

AB Negative environmental impacts from mineral fertilisers and pesticides used in conventional cropping have raised concern over the sustainability of arable crop production. Organic cropping uses alternatives that avoid many of these negative environmental effects; however, crop yields can be significantly reduced, possibly due to a lower proportion of plant-available nutrients. To gain insights into the molecular effects of organic compared to conventional cropping systems on plant utilisation of nutrients, we used proteomics to analyse winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). Our aim was to investigate the effects of contrasting fertility management and crop protection regimes in organic and conventional cropping systems on the wheat flag leaf proteome and the association between the proteome and physiological traits. Wheat flag leaves were flash-frozen, lyophilised and milled prior to protein extraction (TCA/acetone) and analysed using 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS. The abundance of 111 protein spots varied significantly between fertilisation regimes. Flag leaf N and P composition were significant drivers of differences in protein spot abundance, including major proteins involved in nitrogen remobilisation, photosynthesis, metabolism and stress response. These results indicate that molecular-based mechanisms are involved in the effect of contrasting cropping systems on nutrient utilisation and wheat grain yield. Using a functional genomics approach, we were able to identify proteins that are linked to causal genes, enabling the potential development of functional molecular markers for crop improvement in nutrient use efficiency.

AB Increased fertile tiller number is a very important trait in high-yielding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines. Uncovering the fundamental biological progress of fertile tiller formation would improve our understanding of the genetic nature of this trait and increase wheat yield. However, there is no suitable genetic material for studying the genetic mechanism of wheat fertile tiller formation. We report here the development of a fertile tiller inhibition line, Pubing3558, which was derived from a cross between common wheat and wild grass Agropyron cristatum. Pubing3558 possesses normal tillering ability in the seedling stage but reduced fertile tiller formation in the reproductive growth phase. A cross between Pubing3558 and the wheat cultivar Jing4841 with multiple fertile tillers was performed in order to map the fertile tiller inhibition gene (ftin). The F-1 population of the cross between Pubing3558 and Jing4841 showed a normal phenotype similar to that of the parent Jing4841. The F-2 population segregated with a 3:1 Mendelian ratio in 2-year replicates, which was further proven by the segregation ratio of the F-3 population. Genetic analysis uncovered that the fertile tiller inhibition trait in Pubing3558 is controlled by a single recessive gene. Using bulked segregant analysis methods, we located the ftin gene on wheat chromosome 1AS, which is linked closely to markers Xcfa2153 at a genetic distance of 1.0 cM. A combination of phenotype tests and genetic mapping demonstrated that the ftin gene is a newly identified gene in wheat. Overall, our results suggest that Pubing3558 will be valuable genetic source for studying the biological process of fertile tiller formation.

AB Haynaldia villosa Schur. (syn. Dasypyrum villosum Candargy, 2n = 2x = 14, genome VV), a species related to wheat, is highly resistant to powdery mildew. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 from H. villosa was introduced into common wheat by means of a translocation line T6VS center dot 6AL, where the 6VS chromosome arm of H. villosa was joined at the centromere with wheat chromosome arm 6AL. To develop small alien translocations, especially interstitial translocations of small alien chromosome segments, we irradiated mature female gametes of a T6VS center dot 6AL translocation line with gamma rays. More than 20 new translocations and deletions of 6V chromatin were obtained and subsequently used to map Pm21. Pm21 was located in a small region (FL 0.45-0.58) by genomic in situ hybridization, molecular marker analysis, and powdery mildew response. Two homozygous translocation lines with small H. villosa chromosome fragments carrying Pm21 were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular marker analysis: an interstitial translocation in which a small fragment of 6VS is inserted into chromosome 4B and a terminal translocation with a small fragment of 6VS inserted into 1A. These small alien translocations are being transferred into an adapted elite wheat background by backcrossing to allow their easy use in breeding programs.

AB Little is known about the extent or diversity of resistance in soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici. The soft red winter (SRW) wheat cultivar USG 3555 has effective adult-plant resistance to stripe rust, which was characterized in a population derived from USG 3555/Neuse. The mapping population consisted of 99 recombinant inbred lines, which were evaluated for stripe rust infection type (IT) and severity to race PST-100 in field trials in North Carolina in 2010 and 2011. Genome-wide molecular-marker screenings with 119 simple sequence repeats and 560 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers were employed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust resistance. QTL on chromosomes 1AS, 4BL and 7D of USG 3555 explained 12.8, 73.0 and 13.6% of the variation in stripe rust IT, and 13.5, 72.3 and 10.5% of the variation in stripe rust severity, respectively. Use of these and additional diagnostic markers for these QTL will facilitate the introgression of this source of stripe rust resistance into SRW wheat lines via marker-assisted selection.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive wheat disease of global importance. Resistance breeding depends heavily on the Fhb1 gene. The CIMMYT line Shanghai-3/Catbird (SHA3/CBRD) is a promising source without this gene. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from the cross of SHA3/CBRD with the German spring wheat cv. Naxos was evaluated for FHB resistance and related traits in field trials using spray and spawn inoculation in Norway and point inoculation in China. After spray and spawn inoculation, FHB severities were negatively correlated with both anther extrusion (AE) and plant height (PH). The QTL analysis showed that the Rht-B1b dwarfing allele co-localized with a QTL for low AE and increased susceptibility after spawn and spray inoculation. In general, SHA3/CBRD contributed most of the favorable alleles for resistance to severity after spray and spawn inoculation, while Naxos contributed more favorable alleles for reduction in FDK and DON content and resistance to severity after point inoculation. SHA3/CBRD contributed a major resistance QTL close to the centromere on 2DLc affecting FHB severity and DON after all inoculation methods. This QTL was also associated with AE and PH, with high AE and tall alleles contributed by SHA3/CBRD. Several QTL for AE and PH were detected, and low AE or reduced PH was always associated with increased susceptibility after spawn and spray inoculation. Most of the other minor FHB resistance QTL from SHA3/CBRD were associated with AE or PH, while the QTL from Naxos were mostly not. After point inoculation, no other QTL for FHB traits was associated with AE or PH, except the 2DLc QTL which was common across all inoculation methods. Marker-assisted selection based on the 2DLc QTL from SHA3/CBRD combined with phenotypic selection for AE is recommended for resistance breeding based on this valuable source of resistance.

AB Selective phenotyping is a way of capturing the benefits of large population sizes without the need to carry out large-scale phenotyping and hence is a cost-effective means of capturing information about gene-trait relationships within a population. The diversity within the sample gives an indication of the efficiency of this information capture; less diversity implies greater redundancy of the genetic information. Here, we propose a method to maximize genetic diversity within the selected samples. Our method is applicable to general experimental designs and robust to common problems such as missing data and dominant markers. In particular, we discuss its application to multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations, where, although thousands of lines may be genotyped as a large population resource, only hundreds may need to be phenotyped for individual studies. Through simulation, we compare our method to simple random sampling and the minimum moment aberration method. While the gain in power over simple random sampling for all tested methods is not large, our method results in a much more diverse sample of genotypes. This diversity can be applied to improve fine mapping resolution once a QTL region has been detected. Further, when applied to two wheat datasets from doubled haploid and MAGIC progeny, our method detects known QTL for small sample sizes where other methods fail.

AB An important aspect of studying putative new genes in wheat is determining their position on the wheat genetic map. The primary difficulty in mapping genes is determining which chromosome carries the gene of interest. Several approaches have been developed to address this problem, each with advantages and disadvantages. Here we describe a new approach called multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA). A set of 423 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected based on profile simplicity, frequency of polymorphism, and distribution across the wheat genome. SSR primers were preloaded in 384-well PCR plates with each primer occupying 16 wells. In practice, 14 wells are reserved for "mini-bulks" that are equivalent to four gametes (e.g. two F-2 individuals) comprised of individuals from a segregated population that have a known homozygous genotype for the gene of interest. The remaining two wells are reserved for the parents of the population. Each well containing a mini-bulk can have one of three allele compositions for each SSR: only the allele from one parent, only the allele from the other parent, or both alleles. Simulation experiments were performed to determine the pattern of mini-bulk allele composition that would indicate putative linkage between the SSR in question and the gene of interest. As a test case, MBSA was employed to locate an unidentified stem rust resistance (Sr) gene in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40. A doubled haploid (DH) population (n = 267) was produced from hybrids of the cross LMPG-6S/Norin 40. The DH population segregated for a single gene (chi (1:1) (2) = 0.093, p = 0.76) for resistance to Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici race LCBN. Four resistant DH lines were included in each of the 14 mini-bulks for screening. The Sr gene was successfully located to the long arm of chromosome 2D using MBSA. Further mapping confirmed the chromosome location and revealed that the Sr gene was located in a linkage block that may represent an alien translocation. The new Sr gene was designated as Sr54.

AB Selection for phomopsis stem blight disease (PSB) resistance is one of the key objectives in lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) breeding programs. A cross was made between cultivar Tanjil (resistant to PSB) and Unicrop (susceptible). The progeny was advanced into F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The RIL population was phenotyped for PSB disease resistance. Twenty plants from the RIL population representing disease resistance and susceptibility was subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based restriction site-associated DNA sequencing on the NGS platform Solexa HiSeq2000, which generated 7,241 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thirty-three SNP markers showed the correlation between the marker genotypes and the PSB disease phenotype on the 20 representative plants, which were considered as candidate markers linked to a putative R gene for PSB resistance. Seven candidate markers were converted into sequence-specific PCR markers, which were designated as PhtjM1, PhtjM2, PhtjM3, PhtjM4, PhtjM5, PhtjM6 and PhtjM7. Linkage analysis of the disease phenotyping data and marker genotyping data on a F-8 population containing 187 RILs confirmed that all the seven converted markers were associated with the putative R gene within the genetic distance of 2.1 CentiMorgan (cM). One of the PCR markers, PhtjM3, co-segregated with the R gene. The seven established PCR markers were tested in the 26 historical and current commercial cultivars released in Australia. The numbers of "false positives" (showing the resistance marker allele band but lack of the putative R gene) for each of the seven PCR markers ranged from nil to eight. Markers PhtjM4 and PhtjM7 are recommended in marker-assisted selection for PSB resistance in the Australian national lupin breeding program due to its wide applicability on breeding germplasm and close linkage to the putative R gene. The results demonstrated that application of NGS technology is a rapid and cost-effective approach in development of markers for molecular plant breeding.

Fine mapping of leaf rust resistance gene LrZH84 using expressed sequence tag and sequence-tagged site markers, and allelism with other genes on wheat chromosome 1B. Phytopathology 103:169-174. Zhou 8425B, possessing the leaf rust resistance gene LrZH84, is an elite wheat (Triticum aestivum) parental line in the Yellow-Huai Valley region of China. In the present study, 2,086 F-2 plants derived from Zhou 8425B/Chinese Spring were used for fine mapping of LrZH84 with expressed sequence tag (EST) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. Seventy inter-simple sequence repeat EST and STS markers on 1BL were used to screen the two parents and resistant and susceptible bulks; those polymorphic were used to analyze the entire F-2 population. Three EST markers (BF474863, BE497107, and CD373538) were closely linked to LrZH84, with genetic distances of 0.7, 0.7, and 1.7 cM, respectively. STS marker Hbsf-1 was developed from the sequences of polymerase chain reaction fragments amplified from EST marker BF474863. LrZH84 was 8.19 cM proximal to Lr44, but may be allelic to LrXi and LrG98 although they showed different reactions with some Puccinia triticina pathotypes.

AB The oriental melon (Cucumis melo L. var. makuwa cv. 'Silver Light') is an important fruit crop in the tropical and subtropical regions. However, oriental melon production is severely decreased by fungal diseases. In this study, antifungal protein (AFP) and chitinase (CHI) fusion genes were introduced into oriental melons to control fungal diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporum. Transformation of oriental melon (Cucumis melo L. var. makuwa cv. 'Silver Light') with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 containing antifungal protein (AFP) and chitinase (CHI) fusion genes under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene as a selectable marker was performed. Cotyledon explants of oriental melon were inoculated by Agrobacterium suspensions with pBI121-AFP-CHI and cultured in a regeneration medium. After regeneration, genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to confirm the presence of putative transgenic shoots. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the AFP-CHI fusion gene was incorporated into the genomic DNA of the PCR-positive lines. RT-PCR analysis showed that the AFP-CHI fusion gene was expressed in the individual transgenic lines. Western blot analysis revealed the accumulation of CHI protein in leaves. A segregation analysis of the T-1 generation confirmed the inheritance of the transgene. Our results demonstrated that the AFP-CHI fusion gene was effective in protecting the transgenic melon plants against fungal disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporum.

AB Background: Wheat leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks; Pt) and stem rust fungi (P. graminis f.sp. tritici; Pgt) are significant economic pathogens having similar host ranges and life cycles, but different alternate hosts. The Pt genome, currently estimated at 135 Mb, is significantly larger than Pgt, at 88 Mb, but the reason for the expansion is unknown. Three genomic loci of Pt conserved proteins were characterized to gain insight into gene content, genome complexity and expansion.
   Results: A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was made from P. triticina race 1, BBBD and probed with Pt homologs of genes encoding two predicted Pgt secreted effectors and a DNA marker mapping to a region of avirulence. Three BACs, 103 Kb, 112 Kb, and 166 Kb, were sequenced, assembled, and open reading frames were identified. Orthologous genes were identified in Pgt and local conservation of gene order (microsynteny) was observed. Pairwise protein identities ranged from 26 to 99%. One Pt BAC, containing a RAD18 ortholog, shares syntenic regions with two Pgt scaffolds, which could represent both haplotypes of Pgt. Gene sequence is diverged between the species as well as within the two haplotypes. In all three BAC clones, gene order is locally conserved, however, gene shuffling has occurred relative to Pgt. These regions are further diverged by differing insertion loci of LTR-retrotransposon, Gypsy, Copia, Mutator, and Harbinger mobile elements. Uncharacterized Pt open reading frames were also found; these proteins are high in lysine and similar to multiple proteins in Pgt.
   Conclusions: The three Pt loci are conserved in gene order, with a range of gene sequence divergence. Conservation of predicted haustoria expressed secreted protein genes between Pt and Pgt is extended to the more distant poplar rust, Melampsora larici-populina. The loci also reveal that genome expansion in Pt is in part due to higher occurrence of repeat-elements in this species.

AB Background: Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is the major crop from the group of leafy vegetables. Several types of molecular markers were developed that are effectively used in lettuce breeding and genetic studies. However only a very limited number of microsattelite-based markers are publicly available. We have employed the method of enriched microsatellite libraries to develop 97 genomic SSR markers.
   Results: Testing of newly developed markers on a set of 36 Lactuca accession (33 L. sativa, and one of each L. serriola L., L. saligna L., and L. virosa L.) revealed that both the genetic heterozygosity (UHe = 0.56) and the number of loci per SSR (Na = 5.50) are significantly higher for genomic SSR markers than for previously developed EST-based SSR markers (UHe = 0.32, Na = 3.56). Fifty-four genomic SSR markers were placed on the molecular linkage map of lettuce. Distribution of markers in the genome appeared to be random, with the exception of possible cluster on linkage group 6. Any combination of 32 genomic SSRs was able to distinguish genotypes of all 36 accessions. Fourteen of newly developed SSR markers originate from fragments with high sequence similarity to resistance gene candidates (RGCs) and RGC pseudogenes. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of L. sativa accessions showed that approximately 3% of genetic diversity was within accessions, 79% among accessions, and 18% among horticultural types.
   Conclusions: The newly developed genomic SSR markers were added to the pool of previously developed EST-SSRs markers. These two types of SSR-based markers provide useful tools for lettuce cultivar fingerprinting, development of integrated molecular linkage maps, and mapping of genes.

AB The development of alien addition lines is important for transferring useful genes from exotic species into common wheat. A hybrid of common wheat cv. 7182 (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) and Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs) via embryo culture produced the novel intergeneric disomic addition line 59-11. The seed morphology of 59-11 resembled the parent 7182 and it exhibited extreme agronomic characteristics, i.e., twin stable spikelets, fertile florets, and multi-kernel clusters. Furthermore, 59-11 produced plump kernels with a high seed-setting percentage during the advanced maturation stage. The line was screened based on genomic in situ hybridization, EST-SSR, EST-STS, and gliadin to identify P. huashanica chromatin in the wheat background. The chromosome number and configuration of 59-11 was 2n = 44 = 22 II and we confirmed the 6Ns disomic chromosome additions based on A-PAGE analysis and molecular markers. The results suggested that the production of twin spikelets and multiple kernels per spike in the wheat-P. huashanica addition line was related to homologous group 6 in the wheat chromosome. This is the first report of the introduction of improved spike traits into common wheat from the alien species P. huashanica and it opens up the possibility of increasing the wheat yield based on this enlarged gene pool.

AB Plants require the proper balance of zinc (Zn) for normal growth and optimum yield. Interest in Zn has risen in the last decade because Zn deficiency stress is extensive in many areas, causing decreases in crop yields. Zn deficiency also decreases the amount of Zn in cereal grain and diminishes its nutritional quality. Hence, increasing the Zn content of the edible portions of crops should be considered in plant breeding. Available data indicate that Zn enrichment traits are present within the genomes of crops that could allow for substantial increases in the Zn concentration of edible parts without negatively impacting yield. Increasing the amount of Zn in food crops can improve the Zn status of people. Furthermore, the use of Zn-dense seeds results in greater seedling vigor and increased crop yields when the seeds are sown in Zn-poor soils. Progress toward developing mineral-dense seed has mainly relied upon conventional plant breeding approaches, a process that is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Hence, the identification of DNA markers that are diagnostic of Zn efficiency can accelerate the development of cultivars that can remain productive even in Zn-deficient soils. Additionally, these markers may be used to begin identifying the specific genes responsible for differences in the response of genotypes to Zn deficiency.

AB Of the more than 50,000 edible plant species in the world, at least 10,000 species are cereal grains. Three major cereal crops, rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum sp.), provide two-thirds of the world's food energy intake. Although crop yields have improved tremendously thanks to technological advances in the past 50 years, population increases and climate changes continue to threaten the sustainability of current crop productions. Whereas conventional and marker-assisted breeding programs continue to play a major role in crop improvement, genetic engineering has drawn an intense worldwide interest from the scientific community. In the past decade, genetic transformation technologies have revolutionized agricultural practices and millions of hectares of biotech crops have been cultured. Because of its unique ability to insert well-characterized gene sequences into the plant genome, genetic engineering can also provide effective tools to address fundamental biological questions.This technology is expected to continue to be an indispensable approach for both basic and applied research. Here, we overview briefly the development of the genetic transformation in the top seven cereals, namely maize, rice, wheat, barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum sp.), oat (Avena sativa), and millets.The advantages and disadvantages of the two major transformation methods, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated and biolistic methods, are also discussed.

AB With the development of molecular marker technology, crop breeding has been accelerated by marker-assisted selection for the improvement of quantitative traits. However, due to the traits' polygenic nature, traditional marker-assisted selection methods are ill-suited for identification of quantitative trait loci. Genomic selection (GS) was introduced into crop breeding to achieve more accurate predictions by considering all genes or markers simultaneously. We used dozens of sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers for genotyping soybean varieties, and we identified markers associated with hundred-seed weight. The best linear unbiased predictor and Bayesian liner regression methods were used to construct GS models to predict the hundred-seed weight trait based upon genotype information for trait selection. Both GS models showed good prediction performance in soybean, as the correlation coefficient between genomic estimated breeding values and true breeding values was as high as 0.904. This indicated that GS was performed effectively based on dozens of SCAR markers in soybean; these markers were of low density but easily detectable. Therefore, the combination of GS modeling and highly effective molecular marker technology involving SCAR markers can facilitate genetic breeding in soybean. This approach may also be suitable for genetic selection in other crops, such as wheat, maize, and rice.

AB A spontaneous dwarf mutant of wheat was found in an F-5 generation line derived from a cross between Huamai No. 9 and Een No. 1 in 1998; it was named Huaai 01. We characterized the genetic pattern of Huaai 01 and mapped the gene controlling the dwarf trait. This dwarf mutant was found insensitive to exogenous gibberellic acid treatment, based on the length of the first leaf and the coleoptile at the seedling stage, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in the gibberellin response pathway. Genetic analysis revealed that a single gene that is partially recessive controls the dwarf phenotype in Huaai 01. We named the dwarfing gene Rht-B2. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) were examined as identifying markers linked to the Rht-B2 gene in an F-2 population. We screened 904 pairs of primers and identified 5 SSR markers linked to the Rht-B2 gene. Two markers, barc1096 and xgwm495, were located on the flanking region of the Rht-B2 gene at genetic distances of 2.9 and 3.3 cM, respectively. Based on published SSR linkage data for wheat, the Rht-B2 gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4B. This identification and characterization of the Rht-B2 dwarfing gene will facilitate its utilization in wheat breeding.

AB Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), a cool season grain legume, serves as an important cheap source of protein and energy in developing countries, and plays an important role in the enrichment of soil fertility. In order to identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers associated with agro-morphological traits in chickpea, 44 genotypes comprising cultigen, landraces, internationally developed improved lines and wild relatives, were phenotyped for several agro-morphological traits in a randomized complete block design with three replications at Urmia Rainfed Research Station. High genetic variability was observed among the chickpea genotypes for the studied agro-morphological traits. In molecular experiment, genetic variability among genotypes was assessed by using SSR markers. One hundred alleles were generated at 16 SSR loci, with a mean number of alleles per locus of 6.25. Using general linear model (GLM) and applying multiple testing corrections, 10 SSR loci associated with the genes controlling the studied agro-morphological traits were identified. Some identified markers were associated with more than one trait. The identified markers could be of great interest in marker assisted selection (MAS) in chickpea breeding programmes.

AB To produce a good F1 hybrid variety wheat crop, it is necessary to explore novel cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) lines and their maintainer line. This study aimed to identify cytoplasmic variation in three isonuclear-alloplasmic male sterile lines Aegilops kotschyi (Ae. kots) -90-110, Aegilops ventricosa (Ae. ven) -90-110, and Triticum spelta (T. spelta) -90-110 and their maintainer line, A-90-110, at the molecular level. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was isolated using a combination of centrifugation and density gradient ultracentrifugation, sucrose sedimentation, lysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), potassium proteinase, and phenol/chloroform extraction methods. To detect mtDNA purity, specific primers were designed for nuclear (beta-actin) and mitochondrial (COXIII) genes. Results indicated that the mtDNA was pure, and therefore suitable for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genetic analysis. Comparative analysis of mtDNA was conducted using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Reproducible polymorphisms were detected between the Aegilops and Triticum species and the male sterile lines. Four specific primers were screened from 64 AFLP marker primers, which provided the molecular basis for further studies investigating specific cytoplasmic male sterility characteristics.

AB Background: The wheat genome sequence is an essential tool for advanced genomic research and improvements. The generation of a high-quality wheat genome sequence is challenging due to its complex 17 Gb polyploid genome. To overcome these difficulties, sequencing through the construction of BAC-based physical maps of individual chromosomes is employed by the wheat genomics community. Here, we present the construction of the first comprehensive physical map of chromosome 1BS, and illustrate its unique gene space organization and evolution.
   Results: Fingerprinted BAC clones were assembled into 57 long scaffolds, anchored and ordered with 2,438 markers, covering 83% of chromosome 1BS. The BAC-based chromosome 1BS physical map and gene order of the orthologous regions of model grass species were consistent, providing strong support for the reliability of the chromosome 1BS assembly. The gene space for chromosome 1BS spans the entire length of the chromosome arm, with 76% of the genes organized in small gene islands, accompanied by a two-fold increase in gene density from the centromere to the telomere.
   Conclusions: This study provides new evidence on common and chromosome-specific features in the organization and evolution of the wheat genome, including a non-uniform distribution of gene density along the centromeretelomere axis, abundance of non-syntenic genes, the degree of colinearity with other grass genomes and a non-uniform size expansion along the centromere-telomere axis compared with other model cereal genomes. The high-quality physical map constructed in this study provides a solid basis for the assembly of a reference sequence of chromosome 1BS and for breeding applications.

AB In this study, we developed two optimal media for in vitro culture of microspores and germination of mature pollen in Petunia hybrida. The optimal medium for in vitro culture of microspores was 15% sucrose + MS salts + White's vitamins, pH = 6.0 with the maturation and germination rate of 41.77% and 5.38%, respectively, and the optimal medium for germination of mature pollen was 15% sucrose + 20 mg/L H2BO3 + 10 mg/L CaCl2 +10% PEG(4000), pH = 5.8. The germination rates of matured microspores in vivo and in vitro were 69.82% and 19.87%, respectively. In addition, a system of Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in late unicellular and bicellular pollen was also established. We co-cultivated late unicellular and bicellular pollen of P hybrida with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 harboring the plasmid pBI121 with GUS reporter gene under the control of CaMv35S promoter, respectively. The optimal conditions consisted of an OD600 of 0.3 and infection time of 10 min, and we obtained 70.82% of GUS transient expression frequency for late unicellular pollen and 79.33% for bicellular pollen.

AB Triticum aestivum-Hayaldia villosa translocation line V3 has shown effective all-stage resistance to the seven dominant pathotypes of Puccinia striiforms f. sp. tritici prevalent in China. To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, the segregating populations were developed from the cross between V3 and susceptible genotype Mingxian 169, seedlings of the parents and F-2 progeny were tested with six prevalent pathotypes, including CYR29, CYR31, CYR32-6, CYR33, Sun11-4, and Sun11-11, F-1 plants and F-3 lines were also inoculated with Sun11-11 to confirm the result further. The genetic studied results showed that the resistance of V3 against CYR29 was conferred by two dominant genes, independently, one dominant gene and one recessive gene conferring independently or a single dominant gene to confer resistance to CYR31, two complementary dominant genes conferring resistance to both CYR32-6 and Sun11-4, two independently dominant genes or three dominant genes (two of the genes show cumulative effect) conferring resistance to CYR33, a single dominant gene for resistance to Sun11-11. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the single dominant gene (temporarily designated as YrV3) for resistance to Sun11-11. A linkage map of 2 RGAP and 7 SSR markers was constructed for the dominant gene using data from 221 F-2 plants and their derived F-2:3 lines tested with Sun11-11 in the greenhouse. Amplification of the complete set of nulli-tetrasomic lines of Chinese Spring with a RGAP marker RG1 mapped the gene on the chromosome 1B, and then the linked 7 SSR markers located this gene on the long arm of chromosome 1B. The linkage map spanned a genetic distance of 25.0 cM, the SSR markers Xgwm124 and Xcfa2147 closely linked to YrV3 with genetic distances of 3.0 and 3.8 cM, respectively. Based on the linkage map, it concluded that the resistance gene YrV3 was located on chromosome arm 1BL. Given chromosomal location, the reaction patterns and pedigree analysis, YrV3 should be a novel gene for resistance to stripe rust in wheat. These closely linked markers should be useful in stacking genes from different sources for wheat breeding and diversification of resistance genes against stripe rust.

AB Background: As for other major crops, achieving a complete wheat genome sequence is essential for the application of genomics to breeding new and improved varieties. To overcome the complexities of the large, highly repetitive and hexaploid wheat genome, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium established a chromosome-based strategy that was validated by the construction of the physical map of chromosome 3B. Here, we present improved strategies for the construction of highly integrated and ordered wheat physical maps, using chromosome 1BL as a template, and illustrate their potential for evolutionary studies and map-based cloning.
   Results: Using a combination of novel high throughput marker assays and an assembly program, we developed a high quality physical map representing 93% of wheat chromosome 1BL, anchored and ordered with 5,489 markers including 1,161 genes. Analysis of the gene space organization and evolution revealed that gene distribution and conservation along the chromosome results from the superimposition of the ancestral grass and recent wheat evolutionary patterns, leading to a peak of synteny in the central part of the chromosome arm and an increased density of non-collinear genes towards the telomere. With a density of about 11 markers per Mb, the 1BL physical map provides 916 markers, including 193 genes, for fine mapping the 40 QTLs mapped on this chromosome.
   Conclusions: Here, we demonstrate that high marker density physical maps can be developed in complex genomes such as wheat to accelerate map-based cloning, gain new insights into genome evolution, and provide a foundation for reference sequencing.

AB Drought stress is one of the major yield constraints for cereal crops. Traditionally, for developing drought tolerant cultivars, selection either direct or indirect is practiced. Although this approach is effective, yet time consuming and labour intensive. Identification of drought related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) coupled with marker assisted selection has shown some positive results. Transgenic and "omics" technologies promise to make progress in breeding for drought tolerance through a more fundamental understanding of underlying mechanisms of drought tolerance and identifying potential candidate genes. These new approaches provide opportunities to direct the continued breeding of genotypes giving stable yields under drought stress.

AB Heading date is multifarious, polygenic character responsible for the adaptation of rice to various agro-climatic regions. W23-3-8-9-27-82 and W08-16-3-2 are Single Segment Substitution lines containing OsMADS50 on third chromosome of rice. Segregating (F-2) populations of HJX74 x W23-3-8-9-27-82, HJX74 x W08-16-3-2 were utilized in the genetic study of OsMDAS50 gene. From the whole genomic sequence of OsMADS50 gene three functional markers PSM908, PSM909 and PSM910 were developed and utilized for genetic analysis. Significant Chi square values for each population and zero cM genetic distance between OsMADS50 gene and PSM908 proved the linkage with heading date trait. Three different phenotypes of OsMADS50 gene were identified varying in days to heading but linked with PSM908. Expression analysis of OsMADS50, Hd3a, RFT1 revealed strongest expression in W23-3-8-9-27-82, while week expression was found in W08-16-3-2 and weakest expression was observed in HJX74, resulting in earliest heading of W23-3-8-9-27-82, followed by W08-16-3-2 and HJX74. These three different genotypes of OsMADS50 are due to three different naturally occurring alleles of OsMADS50 found in corresponding parental varieties, Lemont's being headed earliest followed by IR64' s and least one was HJX74' s.

AB Basic vegetative period (BVP) is an important trait for determining flowering time and adaptation to variable environments. A short BVP barley mutant is about 30 d shorter than its wild type. Genetic analysis using 557 F-2 individuals revealed that the short BVP is governed by a single recessive gene (BVP-1) and was further validated in 2.090 F-3 individuals. The BVP-1 gene was first mapped to barley chromosome 1H using SSR markers. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that the chromosome region of BYP-1 is syntenic to rice chromosome 5 and Brachypodium chromosome 2. Barley ESTs/genes were identified after comparison with candidate genes in rice and Brachypodium; seven new gene-specific markers were developed and mapped in the mapping populations. The BVP-1 gene co-segregated with the Mot1 and Ftsh4 genes and was flanked by the gene-specific markers AK252360 (0.2 cM) and CA608558 (0.5 cM). Further analysis demonstrated that barley and wheat share the same short BVP gene controlling early flowering.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a severe foliar disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the world. Resistance is the best approach to control the disease. The winter wheat cultivar Lantian 1 has high-temperature resistance to stripe rust. To determing the gene(s) for the stripe rust resistance, Lantian 1 was crossed with Mingxian 169 (M169). Seedlings of the parents, and F-1, F-2 and F2-3 progenies were tested with races CYR32 of Pst under controlled greenhouse conditions. Lantian 1 has a single partially dominant gene conferred resistance to race CYR32, designated as YrLT1. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to YrLT1. A linkage group of five SSR markers was constructed for YrLT1 using 166 F2 plants. Based on the SSR marker consensus map and the position on wheat chromosome, the resistance gene was assigned on chromosome 2DL. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with SSR marker Xwmc797 confirmed that the resistance gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 2D. Because of its chromosomal location and the high-temperature resistance, this gene is different from previously described genes. The molecular map spanned 29.9 cM, and the genetic distance of two close markers Xbarc228 and Xcfd16 to resistance gene locus was 4.0 and 5.7 cM, respectively. The polymorphism rates of the flanking markers in 46 wheat lines were 2.1 and 2.1%, respectively; and the two markers in combination could distinguish the alleles at the resistance locus in 97.9% of tested genotypes. This new gene and flanking markers should be useful in developing wheat cultivars with high level and possible durable resistance to stripe rust.

AB To detect the leaf rust resistance genes in the 7 Chinese spring wheat clultivars Shenmian 99025, Shenmia 99042, Shenmian 85, Shenmian 91, Shenmian 96, Shenmian 1167 and Shenmian 962, Thatcher, Thatcher backgrounded near-isogenic lines and 15 pathotypes of P. triticina were used for gene postulate at the seedling stage, and 9 of the 15 pathotypes were used in the field tests. Molecular markers closely linked to, or co-segregated with resistance genes Lr1, Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr20, Lr21, Lr24, Lr26, Lr28, Lr29, Lr32, Lr34, Lr35, Lr37, Lr38, and Lr47 were screened to assist detection of the resistance genes. As results, 4 known resistance genes, including Lr1, Lr9, Lr26, and Lr34, and other unknown resistance genes were postulated singly or in combination in the tested cultivars. Shenmian 85, Shenmian 91, Shenmian 96, Shenmian 962, Shenmian 1167, and Shenmian 99042 are potentially useful for wheat production and breeding programs. The result suggested that combining gene postulation, molecular markers and pedigrees is effective and more accuracy method to know the resistance genes in cultivars.

AB The identification of genetically homogeneous groups of individuals is an ancient issue in population genetics and in the case of crops like wheat, it can be valuable information for breeding programs, genetic mapping and germplasm resources. In this work we determined the genetic structure of a set of 102 Argentinean bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) elite cultivars using 38 biochemical and molecular markers (functional, closely linked to genes and neutral ones) distributed throughout 18 wheat chromosomes. Genetic relationships among these lines were examined using model-based clustering methods. In the analysis three subpopulations were identified which correspond largely to the origin of the germplasm used by the main breeding programs in Argentina.

AB This study was carried out to investigte the biotechnology laboratory of Department of Field Crops, Ankara University with the aim of investigating the optimum parameters of gene transfer to mature embryo and leaf segment explants of Triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) via particle bombardment (Biolistic) method. Mature embryo and leaf segment explants obtained from Triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) were obtained via bombardment with accelerated gold and tungsten particles coated with the plasmid pBI221.23 containing the b-glucuronidase (GUS: uidA) marker gene. Different bombardment distances from the stopping plate (6, 9, 12, cm) and different rupture disk pressures (900, 1100, 1550 psi) were used as physical parameters. Blue spots expressing the b-glucuronidase gene were detected by using a histochemical assay. The variation in the number of blue spots in bombarded explants was used to determine the gene transfer efficiency. The mature embryos of triticale were found to be more amenable for the direct delivery of foreign gene by the particle bombardment technique than the leaf segments. Also the gold particles were more suitable than tungsten particles in the gene transfer efficiency. The highest gene transfer results were obtained in mature embryos when 6 cm bombardment distance and 1100 psi rupture disk pressure were used.

AB The goal of the present research work was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the genetic variation of relative water content and chlorophyll concentration in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. 70 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) out of 123 from the cross PAC2 x RHA266 and their parental lines were evaluated in a rectangular 8 x 9 lattice design with two replications under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. High genetic variability and transgressive segregation was observed among RILs for evaluated traits in both water treatment conditions. QTLs were mapped using an updated high-density simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage map. The map consisted of 210 SSR and 11 genes placed in 17 linkage groups. The total map length is 1,653.1 cM (centimorgan) with a mean density of 1 marker per 7.44 cM. Under well-watered state, 3 and 6 QTLs were identified for chlorophyll concentration and relative water content, respectively. In water-stressed condition 7 and 2 QTLs were identified. The percentage of phenotypic variance (R-2) explained by QTLs ranged from 0.39% to 52.48%. QTLs for chlorophyll concentration and relative water content on linkage group 10 and 16 were overlapped. Common QTLs for different traits in both water treatment conditions on linkage groups 10 seem to be more important as it gives a constitutive performance for the traits without being affected by water treatment.

AB Photoperiod and vernalisation genes are important for the adaptation of wheat to variable environments. Previously, using diagnostic markers and a large, unbalanced dataset from southern Australia, we estimated the effects on days to heading of frequent alleles of Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1, and also two allelic classes of Ppd-D1. These genes accounted for similar to 45% of the genotypic variance for that trait. We now extend these analyses to further alleles of Ppd-D1, and four alleles of Ppd-B1 associated with copy number.
   Variation in copy number of Ppd-B1 occurred in our population, with one to four linked copies present. Additionally, in rare instances, the Ppd-B1gene was absent (a null allele). The one-copy allele, which we labelled Ppd-B1b, and the three-copy allele, which we labelled Ppd-B1a, occurred through a century of wheat breeding, and are still frequent. With several distinct progenitors, the one-copy allele might not be homogenous. The two-copy allele, which we labelled Ppd-B1d, was generally introduced from WW15 (syn. Anza), and the four-copy allele, which we labelled Ppd-B1c, came from Chinese Spring. In paired comparisons, Ppd-B1a and Ppd-B1c reduced days to heading, but Ppd-B1d increased days to heading.
   Ppd-D1a, with a promoter deletion, Ppd-D1d, with a deletion in Exon 7, and Ppd-D1b, the intact allele, were frequent in modern Australian germplasm. Differences between Ppd-D1a and Ppd-D1d for days to heading under our field conditions depended on alleles of the vernalisation genes, confirming our previous report of large epistatic interactions between these classes of genes. The Ppd-D1b allele conferred a photoperiod response that might be useful for developing cultivars with closer to optimal heading dates from variable sowing dates. Inclusion of Ppd-B1 genotypes, and more precise resolution of Ppd-D1, increased the proportion of the genotypic variance attributed to these vernalisation and photoperiod genes to similar to 53%.

AB English grain aphid (EGA, Sitobion avenae Fabricius) is an important pest in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To develop EGA-resistant varieties, introducing the desirable genes from related species is regarded as an efficient avenue. In this study, the F-1, F-2 and F-3 plants derived from the cross of EGA-susceptible wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo amphiploid (PHW-SA, AABBDDNsNs) and EGA-resistant triticale (Zhongsi 828, AABBRR) were analyzed for EGA resistance. Consequently, PHW-SA was moderately susceptible while Zhongsi 828 and their F-1 hybrids were immune, suggesting that the resistance is dominant. All the F-2 plants showed high resistance or immunity over two years, indicating that EGA resistance genes are more likely carried by the rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosomes rather than the genomes A or B of Zhongsi 828. In the F 3 generation, 25 of 239 lines became susceptible. Giemsa C-banding patterns revealed that these F-3 lines had 38-40 chromosomes, including complete rye genome except 5R (and 2R in five lines). Genomic in situ hybridization analysis confirmed this result. During meiosis, all the chromosomes formed bivalents. Six bivalents in 20 lines and five bivalents in five lines were characterized from rye. In contrast, their F-2 parental lines had 42 chromosomes (21 bivalents), containing 1R-7R of rye. No P. huashanica chromosomes were detected. Therefore, we propose that the rye chromosome 5R may be related to EGA resistance.

AB Pathogens are a reason for low yield in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Stripe rust (or yellow rust), caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat. One of the most cost-effective and environmentally sound ways to control stripe rust is to use plant varieties that are resistant to this pathogen. It is an important task for wheat breeders and pathologists to identify new genes and pyramid them in order to achieve high-level, durable resistance to stripe rust. One spring wheat germplasm, HRMSN-81, with resistance to the most dominant races in China, is identified from the CIMMYT breeding lines. To elucidate the genetic basis of its resistance, HRMSN-81 was crossed with susceptible wheat genotype Taichung 29. Seedlings of the parents were tested with Chinese Pst isolates CYR31, CYR32, and CYR33 under controlled greenhouse conditions, and adult plants of the parents and F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 progeny were inoculated with the epidemic stripe rust mixed races, including CYR31, CYR32, and CYR33, in fields under natural infection.
   Genetic analysis showed that HRMSN-81 has a single dominant gene conferring all-stage resistance, temporarily designated as YrHRMSN-81. Resistance gene analogue polymorphism (RGAP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), target region amplified polymorphism (TRAP), and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) techniques in combination with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. A linkage map consisting of six RGAP, two SSR, one TRAP, and two SRAP markers was constructed for YrHRMSN-81 using 148 F2 plants. The gene was mapped to chromosome arm 2DS by testing the complete set of nulli-tetrasomic lines and selected ditelosomic lines with two RGAP markers and was further confirmed by two chromosome-specific SSR markers. The results of gene characteristics and chromosome locations indicated that YrHRMSN-81 was probably a new stripe rust resistance gene. The two flanking markers Xwgp-180bp (93% polymorphism rate) and Xwmc453 (91% polymorphism rate) detected 100% polymorphism of the 56 tested wheat genotypes when they were used in combination. The identification of the gene YrHRMSN-81 and the determination of the flanking markers should be useful for rapidly transferring it in wheat breeding programs.

AB A segregating population with 410 F-2 individuals from the cross MERCIA (Rht-B1a) x Dwarf 123 was made to identify a new major dwarfing gene carrying by novel wheat germplasm Dwarf 123. Combination of bulk segerant analysis method was used. A total of 145 SSR markers were tested for polymorphisms among parental lines and DNA bulks of F-2 population. Out of 145 primer pairs only three markers revealed corresponding polymorphism among parental lines and F-2 DNA bulks. The marker Barc20 was close to the dwarfing gene with a genetic distance of 1.8 cM, and markers Gwm513 and Gwm495 were linked to the gene with genetic distance of 6.7 and 13 cM, respectively. Linkage analysis mapped the dwarfing gene to the long arm of chromosome 4B with the order of Barc20-dwarfing gene-Gwm513-Gwm495. The Comparision between the new gene and the known Rht-B1 alleles showed that dwarfing gene Rht-Ai123 was different from the others. The identification of the new dwarfing gene and its linked markers will greatly facilitate its utilization in wheat high yield breeding for reducing plant height.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases in many wheat-growing regions of the world. The winter wheat translocation line H9014-14-4-6-1 has all stage resistance. To identify stripe rust resistance genes, the segregating populations were developed from the cross between H9014-14-4-6-1 and Mingxian 169 (a wheat cultivar susceptible to all Pst races identified in China). The seedlings of the parents and F-1 plants, F-2, F-3 and BC1 generations were tested with Pst races under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two genes for resistance to stripe rust were identified, one dominant gene conferred resistance to SUN11-4, temporarily designated YrH9014 and the other recessive gene conferred resistance to CYR33. The bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to identify polymorphic markers associated with YrH9014. Seven polymorphic SSR markers were used to genotype the F-2 population inoculated with SUN11-4. A linkage map was constructed according to the genotypes of seven SSR markers and resistance gene. The molecular map spanned 24.3 cM, and the genetic distance of the two closest markers Xbarc13 and Xbarc55 to gene locus was 1.4 and 3.6 cM, respectively. Based on the position of SSR marker, the resistance gene YrH9014 was located on chromosome arm 2BS. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with SSR marker Xbarc13 indicated that YrH9014 was located on chromosome 2B. Based on chromosomal location, the reaction patterns and pedigree analysis, YrH9014 should be a novel resistance gene to stripe rust. This new gene and flanking markers got from this study should be useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs for stripe rust.

AB Thinopyrum intermedium is a useful source of resistance genes for Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV), one of the most damaging wheat diseases. In this study, wheat/Th. intermedium translocation lines with a BYDV resistance gene were developed using the Th. intermedium 7Ai-1 chromosome. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), using a Th. intermedium total genomic DNA probe, enabled detection of 7Ai-1-derived small chro-matins containing a BYDV resistance gene, which were translocated onto the end of wheat chromosomes in the lines Y95011 and Y960843. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses using 120 random 10-mer primers were conducted to compare the BYDV-resistant translocation lines with susceptible lines. Two primers amplified the DNA fragments specific to the resistant line that would be useful as molecular markers to identify 7Ai-1-derived BYDV resistance chromatin in the wheat genome. Additionally, the isolated Th. intermedium-specific retrotransposon-like sequence pTi28 can be used to identify Th. intermedium chromatin transferred to the wheat genome.

AB For genetic analysis of Ppd-1 homoeologs controlling photoperiodic response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), bulk segregant analysis was performed using a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross of Japanese wheat genotypes Winter-Abukumawase and Chihokukomugi. Based on the segregation of simple sequence repeat markers linked to the Ppd-1 homoeologs, Winter-Abukumawase carried insensitive alleles Ppd-B1a and Ppd-D1a and Chihokukomugi carried a single insensitive allele (Ppd-A1a) that was first found in common wheat. The genomic sequence of Ppd-1 homoeologs including the 5' upstream region was determined and compared between the two genotypes. Ppd-D1a of Winter-Abukumawase had a deletion of 2,089 bp that was already reported for Ciano 67. Critical sequence polymorphism causing photoperiod insensitivity was not detected from the translation start codon to the 3' untranslated region of Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1. However, novel mutations were found in the 5' upstream region. Ppd-A1a of Chihokukomugi had a deletion of 1,085 bp and Ppd-B1a of Winter-Abukumawase had an insertion of 308 bp. A total of 80 DH lines were classified into eight genotypes by PCR-based genotyping using specific primer sets to detect the In/Dels in the 5' upstream region of three Ppd-1 genes. The heading dates of the DH lines differed significantly between the eight genotypes, showing that each of the three insensitive alleles accelerates heading by 7-9 days compared with the photoperiod-sensitive genotype. Interaction between the three genes was also significant.

AB Sterol methyltransferase 1 (STE1) catalyzes a dagger(7) sterol C-5 desaturation in the conversion of 24-methylenecholesterol to campestral in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, and STE1 has been proven to influence plant architecture by controlling the BR levels in Arabidopsis. In the present study, TaSTE (wheat), the ortholog of AtSTE1 (Arabidopsis), was cloned and mapped to wheat chromosome homologous group 3 in the interval between simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers CWM48.1 and WMC532, with genetic distances of 17.7 and 7.6 cM, respectively. Both linkage and association analyses revealed that TaSTE-A1 was significantly associated with plant height in bread wheat. In silico expression results showed similar expression patterns among TaSTE, HvSTE1 (barley), OsSTE1 (also known as OsDWF7 in rice), and AtSTE1, suggesting that these orthologs might share common functions among wheat, barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. The haplotype frequencies in wild species, landraces, and modern cultivars indicated that haplotype II (Hap II) was associated with reduced plant height and positively selected during modern breeding improvement. One pair of complementary allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers can distinguish haplotype I (Hap I) and Hap II and could be developed to assist selection in wheat architecture breeding.

AB Japanese barnyard millet is an important food source in East Asian countries. However its crumbly texture limits desirability and consumption. Controlling amylose level in the endosperm is important to improve the eating quality of the millet. Because it is well known that the waxy gene determines the amylose level in the endosperm, we conducted a molecular analysis of the gene. Segregation analysis revealed that wild-type cultivars had three functional genes while low-amylose cultivars had one. We determined complete sequences of the three homoeologous waxy structural genes, EeWx1, EeWx2 and EeWx3, in a wild-type cultivar. These sequences showed high homology in the exon regions (97 %), and lower homology in the introns (82 %). Two spontaneous mutations were characterized in the low-amylose cultivars. In addition, one induced mutation was found in the fully waxy cultivar, Chojuromochi. Spontaneous mutations are deletions of whole and terminal regions in the EeWx2 and EeWx3 alleles, respectively. The induced mutation is a single-base deletion that led to a premature termination codon in EeWx1. These findings led us to develop useful markers for selecting low-amylose and waxy lines in millet.

AB Blue wheat grain contains different groups of pigments that can be used for making specialty foods or as food colorants. Thinopyrum bessarabicum, a wild relative of wheat, carries a blue-grained gene on chromosome 4J. In this study, we analyzed the mitotic chromosomes of 159 F7 lines derived from the cross between Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and a CS-Th. bessarabicum amphiploid by using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, genomic in situ hybridization, and newly developed chromosome 4J-specific DNA markers. Intact chromosome 4J and various 4J chromosomal segments were identified in the 159 lines. The blue-grained gene of Th. bessarabicum was physically localized to the region between the centromere and FL0.52 on chromosome arm 4JL. The chromosomal location of this gene differed from the location of previously reported blue-grained genes. In addition, a strong dosage effect was observed with this gene. These results suggest that the blue-grained gene in Th. bessarabicum represents a novel gene locus for blue aleurone, designated BaThb. The wheat lines and 4J chromosome-specific molecular markers developed in this study will facilitate the introgression and utilization of BaThb for wheat nutritional quality improvement.

The generated sequence data revealed the 88- or 105-bp indel in the first intron of the Lr21 gene in the selected resistant cultivars compared to susceptible US spring and winter wheat cultivars. Allele-specific primers for a KASPar assay were designed around the junction of the indel at position 1,346 bp. The marker was tested on a panel of 384 US wheat lines and found to be effective in differentiating resistant and susceptible genotypes.

AB Club wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. compactum) is an important component of the export grain market for the Pacific Northwest. Our objective was to develop a club wheat cultivar with resistance to stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici Westend.) and strawbreaker foot rot [caused by Oculimacula yallundae Crous & W. Gams (Wallwork & Spooner) and O. acuformis (Boerema, R. Pieters & Hamers) Crous. & W. Gams] and with the end-use qualities that make club wheat a specialty product. The bulk pedigree breeding method was used to select 'Cara' (Reg. No. CV-1078, PI 643435) from the cross WA7752//WA6581/WA7217 made in 1992. Cara is a semidwarf wheat with the Rht-D1b dwarfing allele. Cara has winter hardiness equal to that of other club wheat cultivars-Bruehl, Chukar, and Coda-but less than the soft white wheat cultivars Eltan (PI 536994) or Masami (PI 634715). Cara was evaluated in multi-environment replicated plot trials in the Washington since 2003. Grain yields were equal to or better than other club and soft white cultivars in the 30- to 40-cm and the 40- to 50-cm annual precipitation zones. The milling and baking quality of Cara was equal to those of the best club wheat check cultivars. Cara is resistant to all races of stripe rust prevalent since 2001, possessing Yr17 and unknown genes for stripe rust resistance. It is also resistant to strawbreaker foot rot, possessing Pch1. Cara provides growers with an agronomically competitive cultivar with resistance to stripe rust and strawbreaker foot rot plus excellent club wheat end-use quality.

AB Agronomically important traits are frequently controlled by rare, genotype-specific alleles. Such genes can only be mapped in a population derived from the donor genotype. This requires the development of a specific genetic map, which is difficult in wheat because of the low level of polymorphism among elite cultivars. The absence of sufficient polymorphism, the complexity of the hexaploid wheat genome as well as the lack of complete sequence information make the construction of genetic maps with a high density of reproducible and polymorphic markers challenging. We developed a genotype-specific genetic map of chromosome 3B from winter wheat cultivars Arina and Forno. Chromosome 3B was isolated from the two cultivars and then sequenced to 10-fold coverage. This resulted in a single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) database of the complete chromosome. Based on proposed synteny with the Brachypodium model genome and gene annotation, sequences close to coding regions were used for the development of 70 SNP-based markers. They were mapped on a ArinaxForno Recombinant Inbred Lines population and found to be spread over the complete chromosome 3B. While overall synteny was well maintained, numerous exceptions and inversions of syntenic gene order were identified. Additionally, we found that the majority of recombination events occurred in distal parts of chromosome 3B, particularly in hot-spot regions. Compared with the earlier map based on SSR and RFLP markers, the number of markers increased fourfold. The approach presented here allows fast development of genotype-specific polymorphic markers that can be used for mapping and marker-assisted selection.

AB The diversity and evolution of wheat (Triticum-Aegilops group) genomes is determined, in part, by the activity of transposable elements that constitute a large fraction of the genome (up to 90%). In this study, we retrieved sequences from publicly available wheat databases, including a 454-pyrosequencing database, and analyzed 18,217 insertions of 18 Stowaway-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) families previously characterized in wheat that together account for approximately 1.3 Mb of sequence. All 18 families showed high conservation in length, sequence, and target site preference. Furthermore, approximately 55% of the elements were inserted in transcribed regions, into or near known wheat genes. Notably, we observed significant correlation between the mean length of the MITEs and their copy number. In addition, the genomic composition of nine MITE families was studied by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in 40 accessions of Triticum spp. and Aegilops spp., including diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction data showed massive and significant intraspecific and interspecific variation as well as genome-specific proliferation and nonadditive quantities in the polyploids. We also observed significant differences in the methylation status of the insertion sites among MITE families. Our data thus suggest a possible role for MITEs in generating genome diversification and in the establishment of nascent polyploid species in wheat.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases in many wheat-growing regions of the world. The winter wheat translocation line H9014-14-4-6-1 has all stage resistance. To identify stripe rust resistance genes, the segregating populations were developed from the cross between H9014-14-4-6-1 and Mingxian 169 (a wheat cultivar susceptible to all Pst races identified in China). The seedlings of the parents and F-1 plants, F-2, F-3 and BC1 generations were tested with Pst races under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two genes for resistance to stripe rust were identified, one dominant gene conferred resistance to SUN11-4, temporarily designated YrH9014 and the other recessive gene conferred resistance to CYR33. The bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to identify polymorphic markers associated with YrH9014. Seven polymorphic SSR markers were used to genotype the F-2 population inoculated with SUN11-4. A linkage map was constructed according to the genotypes of seven SSR markers and resistance gene. The molecular map spanned 24.3 cM, and the genetic distance of the two closest markers Xbarc13 and Xbarc55 to gene locus was 1.4 and 3.6 cM, respectively. Based on the position of SSR marker, the resistance gene YrH9014 was located on chromosome arm 2BS. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with SSR marker Xbarc13 indicated that YrH9014 was located on chromosome 2B. Based on chromosomal location, the reaction patterns and pedigree analysis, YrH9014 should be a novel resistance gene to stripe rust. This new gene and flanking markers got from this study should be useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs for stripe rust.

Plant Breed., 49: 1-8. One of the main wheat breeder's goals is determining specific genomic regions which control important agronomical traits. Association analysis is a new strategy with high resolution in plant molecular breeding that could be used to improve the efficiency of marker assisted selection (MAS) for finding important QTLs (quantitative trait loci) or genes. A set of 96 diverse wheat genotypes was phenotypically measured during three growing seasons (2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09). Microsatellite markers located near important QTLs were carefully chosen in accordance with existing literature data to validate marker trait associations (MTA). Genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method and PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis. The population structure was assigned based on molecular data in Structure v. 2.0 software, while association analysis was done by the Tassel program using the Q matrix. Nine significant associations were stable in all years investigated and eight MTA were detected to be significant in two growing seasons. Microsatellite markers which showed significant associations and stability in different seasons can be useful and suitable for marker assisted selection (MAS) in Serbian wheat breeding programs.

AB Thinopyrum intermedium is a useful source of resistance genes for Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV), one of the most damaging wheat diseases. In this study, wheat/Th. intermedium translocation lines with a BYDV resistance gene were developed using the Th. intermedium 7Ai-1 chromosome. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), using a Th. intermedium total genomic DNA probe, enabled detection of 7Ai-1-derived small chro-matins containing a BYDV resistance gene, which were translocated onto the end of wheat chromosomes in the lines Y95011 and Y960843. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses using 120 random 10-mer primers were conducted to compare the BYDV-resistant translocation lines with susceptible lines. Two primers amplified the DNA fragments specific to the resistant line that would be useful as molecular markers to identify 7Ai-1-derived BYDV resistance chromatin in the wheat genome. Additionally, the isolated Th. intermedium-specific retrotransposon-like sequence pTi28 can be used to identify Th. intermedium chromatin transferred to the wheat genome.

AB For genetic analysis of Ppd-1 homoeologs controlling photoperiodic response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), bulk segregant analysis was performed using a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross of Japanese wheat genotypes Winter-Abukumawase and Chihokukomugi. Based on the segregation of simple sequence repeat markers linked to the Ppd-1 homoeologs, Winter-Abukumawase carried insensitive alleles Ppd-B1a and Ppd-D1a and Chihokukomugi carried a single insensitive allele (Ppd-A1a) that was first found in common wheat. The genomic sequence of Ppd-1 homoeologs including the 5' upstream region was determined and compared between the two genotypes. Ppd-D1a of Winter-Abukumawase had a deletion of 2,089 bp that was already reported for Ciano 67. Critical sequence polymorphism causing photoperiod insensitivity was not detected from the translation start codon to the 3' untranslated region of Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1. However, novel mutations were found in the 5' upstream region. Ppd-A1a of Chihokukomugi had a deletion of 1,085 bp and Ppd-B1a of Winter-Abukumawase had an insertion of 308 bp. A total of 80 DH lines were classified into eight genotypes by PCR-based genotyping using specific primer sets to detect the In/Dels in the 5' upstream region of three Ppd-1 genes. The heading dates of the DH lines differed significantly between the eight genotypes, showing that each of the three insensitive alleles accelerates heading by 7-9 days compared with the photoperiod-sensitive genotype. Interaction between the three genes was also significant.

AB Sterol methyltransferase 1 (STE1) catalyzes a dagger(7) sterol C-5 desaturation in the conversion of 24-methylenecholesterol to campestral in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, and STE1 has been proven to influence plant architecture by controlling the BR levels in Arabidopsis. In the present study, TaSTE (wheat), the ortholog of AtSTE1 (Arabidopsis), was cloned and mapped to wheat chromosome homologous group 3 in the interval between simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers CWM48.1 and WMC532, with genetic distances of 17.7 and 7.6 cM, respectively. Both linkage and association analyses revealed that TaSTE-A1 was significantly associated with plant height in bread wheat. In silico expression results showed similar expression patterns among TaSTE, HvSTE1 (barley), OsSTE1 (also known as OsDWF7 in rice), and AtSTE1, suggesting that these orthologs might share common functions among wheat, barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. The haplotype frequencies in wild species, landraces, and modern cultivars indicated that haplotype II (Hap II) was associated with reduced plant height and positively selected during modern breeding improvement. One pair of complementary allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers can distinguish haplotype I (Hap I) and Hap II and could be developed to assist selection in wheat architecture breeding.

AB Japanese barnyard millet is an important food source in East Asian countries. However its crumbly texture limits desirability and consumption. Controlling amylose level in the endosperm is important to improve the eating quality of the millet. Because it is well known that the waxy gene determines the amylose level in the endosperm, we conducted a molecular analysis of the gene. Segregation analysis revealed that wild-type cultivars had three functional genes while low-amylose cultivars had one. We determined complete sequences of the three homoeologous waxy structural genes, EeWx1, EeWx2 and EeWx3, in a wild-type cultivar. These sequences showed high homology in the exon regions (97 %), and lower homology in the introns (82 %). Two spontaneous mutations were characterized in the low-amylose cultivars. In addition, one induced mutation was found in the fully waxy cultivar, Chojuromochi. Spontaneous mutations are deletions of whole and terminal regions in the EeWx2 and EeWx3 alleles, respectively. The induced mutation is a single-base deletion that led to a premature termination codon in EeWx1. These findings led us to develop useful markers for selecting low-amylose and waxy lines in millet.

AB Blue wheat grain contains different groups of pigments that can be used for making specialty foods or as food colorants. Thinopyrum bessarabicum, a wild relative of wheat, carries a blue-grained gene on chromosome 4J. In this study, we analyzed the mitotic chromosomes of 159 F7 lines derived from the cross between Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and a CS-Th. bessarabicum amphiploid by using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, genomic in situ hybridization, and newly developed chromosome 4J-specific DNA markers. Intact chromosome 4J and various 4J chromosomal segments were identified in the 159 lines. The blue-grained gene of Th. bessarabicum was physically localized to the region between the centromere and FL0.52 on chromosome arm 4JL. The chromosomal location of this gene differed from the location of previously reported blue-grained genes. In addition, a strong dosage effect was observed with this gene. These results suggest that the blue-grained gene in Th. bessarabicum represents a novel gene locus for blue aleurone, designated BaThb. The wheat lines and 4J chromosome-specific molecular markers developed in this study will facilitate the introgression and utilization of BaThb for wheat nutritional quality improvement.

AB Development and utilization of genetic markers play a pivotal role in marker-assisted breeding of wheat cultivars with pyramids of disease resistance genes. The objective of this study was to develop a closed-tube, gel-free assay for high-throughput genotyping of leaf rust resistance locus Lr21. Polymorphism identified from re-sequencing of a 2.4-kb fragment covering the functional region of the Lr21 gene from the second to the fourth indels was targeted for assay development. The generated sequence data revealed the 88- or 105-bp indel in the first intron of the Lr21 gene in the selected resistant cultivars compared to susceptible US spring and winter wheat cultivars. Allele-specific primers for a KASPar assay were designed around the junction of the indel at position 1,346 bp. The marker was tested on a panel of 384 US wheat lines and found to be effective in differentiating resistant and susceptible genotypes.

AB Club wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. compactum) is an important component of the export grain market for the Pacific Northwest. Our objective was to develop a club wheat cultivar with resistance to stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici Westend.) and strawbreaker foot rot [caused by Oculimacula yallundae Crous & W. Gams (Wallwork & Spooner) and O. acuformis (Boerema, R. Pieters & Hamers) Crous. & W. Gams] and with the end-use qualities that make club wheat a specialty product. The bulk pedigree breeding method was used to select 'Cara' (Reg. No. CV-1078, PI 643435) from the cross WA7752//WA6581/WA7217 made in 1992. Cara is a semidwarf wheat with the Rht-D1b dwarfing allele. Cara has winter hardiness equal to that of other club wheat cultivars-Bruehl, Chukar, and Coda-but less than the soft white wheat cultivars Eltan (PI 536994) or Masami (PI 634715). Cara was evaluated in multi-environment replicated plot trials in the Washington since 2003. Grain yields were equal to or better than other club and soft white cultivars in the 30- to 40-cm and the 40- to 50-cm annual precipitation zones. The milling and baking quality of Cara was equal to those of the best club wheat check cultivars. Cara is resistant to all races of stripe rust prevalent since 2001, possessing Yr17 and unknown genes for stripe rust resistance. It is also resistant to strawbreaker foot rot, possessing Pch1. Cara provides growers with an agronomically competitive cultivar with resistance to stripe rust and strawbreaker foot rot plus excellent club wheat end-use quality.

AB Agronomically important traits are frequently controlled by rare, genotype-specific alleles. Such genes can only be mapped in a population derived from the donor genotype. This requires the development of a specific genetic map, which is difficult in wheat because of the low level of polymorphism among elite cultivars. The absence of sufficient polymorphism, the complexity of the hexaploid wheat genome as well as the lack of complete sequence information make the construction of genetic maps with a high density of reproducible and polymorphic markers challenging. We developed a genotype-specific genetic map of chromosome 3B from winter wheat cultivars Arina and Forno. Chromosome 3B was isolated from the two cultivars and then sequenced to 10-fold coverage. This resulted in a single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) database of the complete chromosome. Based on proposed synteny with the Brachypodium model genome and gene annotation, sequences close to coding regions were used for the development of 70 SNP-based markers. They were mapped on a ArinaxForno Recombinant Inbred Lines population and found to be spread over the complete chromosome 3B. While overall synteny was well maintained, numerous exceptions and inversions of syntenic gene order were identified. Additionally, we found that the majority of recombination events occurred in distal parts of chromosome 3B, particularly in hot-spot regions. Compared with the earlier map based on SSR and RFLP markers, the number of markers increased fourfold. The approach presented here allows fast development of genotype-specific polymorphic markers that can be used for mapping and marker-assisted selection.

AB The diversity and evolution of wheat (Triticum-Aegilops group) genomes is determined, in part, by the activity of transposable elements that constitute a large fraction of the genome (up to 90%). In this study, we retrieved sequences from publicly available wheat databases, including a 454-pyrosequencing database, and analyzed 18,217 insertions of 18 Stowaway-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) families previously characterized in wheat that together account for approximately 1.3 Mb of sequence. All 18 families showed high conservation in length, sequence, and target site preference. Furthermore, approximately 55% of the elements were inserted in transcribed regions, into or near known wheat genes. Notably, we observed significant correlation between the mean length of the MITEs and their copy number. In addition, the genomic composition of nine MITE families was studied by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in 40 accessions of Triticum spp. and Aegilops spp., including diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction data showed massive and significant intraspecific and interspecific variation as well as genome-specific proliferation and nonadditive quantities in the polyploids. We also observed significant differences in the methylation status of the insertion sites among MITE families. Our data thus suggest a possible role for MITEs in generating genome diversification and in the establishment of nascent polyploid species in wheat.

AB Two of the domains most widely shared among R genes are the nucleotide binding site (NBS) and protein kinase (PK) domains. The present study describes and maps a number of new oat resistance gene analogues (RGAs) with two purposes in mind: (1) to identify genetic regions that contain R genes and (2) to determine whether RGAs can be used as molecular markers for qualitative loci and for QTLs affording resistance to Puccinia coronata. Such genes have been mapped in the diploid A. strigosa x A. wiestii (Asw map) and the hexaploid MN841801-1 x Noble-2 (MN map). Genomic and cDNA NBS-RGA probes from oat, barley and wheat were used to produce RFLPs and to obtain markers by motif-directed profiling based on the NBS (NBS profiling) and PK (PK profiling) domains. The efficiency of primers used in NBS/PK profiling to amplify RGA fragments was assessed by sequencing individual marker bands derived from genomic and cDNA fragments. The positions of 184 markers were identified in the Asw map, while those for 99 were identified in the MN map. Large numbers of NBS and PK profiling markers were found in clusters across different linkage groups, with the PK profiling markers more evenly distributed. The location of markers throughout the genetic maps and the composition of marker clusters indicate that NBS- and PK-based markers cover partly complementary regions of oat genomes. Markers of the different classes obtained were found associated with the two resistance loci, PcA and R-284B-2, mapped on Asw, and with five out of eight QTLs for partial resistance in the MN map. 53 RGA-RFLPs and 187 NBS/PK profiling markers were also mapped on the hexaploid map A. byzantina cv. Kanota x A. sativa cv. Ogle. Significant co-localization was seen between the RGA markers in the KO map and other markers closely linked to resistance loci, such as those for P. coronata and barley yellow dwarf virus (Bydv) that were previously mapped in other segregating populations.

AB Stripe rust-resistant wheat introgression line CH223 was developed by crossing the resistant partial amphiploid TAI7047 derived from Thinopyrum intermedium with susceptible cultivars. The resistance is effective against all the existing Chinese stripe rust races, including the most widely virulent and predominant pathotypes CYR32 and CYR33. Cytological analyses using GISH detected no chromosomal segments from Th. intermedium. It was presumed that the segment was too small to be detected. Normal bivalent pairing at meiosis in CH223 and its hybrids confirmed its stability. Genetic analysis of the F-1, F-2, F-3 and BC1 populations from crosses of CH223 with susceptible lines indicated that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. The resistance gene was mapped using an F-2:3 population from Taichung 29/CH223. The gene was linked to five co-dominant genomic SSR markers, Xgwm540, Xbarc1096, Xwmc47, Xwmc310 and Xgpw7272, and flanked by Xbarc1096 and Xwmc47 at 8.0 and 7.2 cM, respectively. Using the Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines, the polymorphic markers and the resistance gene were assigned to chromosome arm 4BL. As no permanently named stripe rust resistance genes had been assigned to chromosome 4BL, this new resistance gene is designated Yr50. The gene, together with the identified closely linked markers, could be used in marker-assisted selection to combine two or more resistance genes in a single genotype.

AB Introgression of sequences from crop species in wild relatives is of fundamental and practical concern. Here, we address gene flow between cultivated wheat and its widespread polyploid relative, Aegilops triuncialis, using 12 EST-SSR markers mapped on wheat chromosomes. The presence of wheat diagnostic alleles in natural populations of the barbed goatgrass growing in proximity to cultivated fields highlights that substantial gene flow occurred when both species coexisted. Furthermore, loci from the A subgenome of wheat were significantly less introgressed than sequences from other subgenomes, indicating differential introgression into Ae. triuncialis. Gene flow between such species sharing nonhomeologous chromosomes addresses the evolutionary outcomes of hybridization and may be important for efficient gene containment.

AB An efficient transformation protocol was developed for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Phellodendron amurense Rupr. for using explants from mature seeds. The binary vector pCAMBIA1303, which contained hygromycin phosphotransferase (hptII) as a selectable marker gene and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter gene, was used for transformation studies. Different factors that affect survival of transformed buds, namely Agrobacterium infection method, bacterial strain, pre-culture duration, acetosyringone concentration, co-culture duration, and co-culture temperature were examined and optimized for transformation efficiency on the basis of GUS staining of hygromycin-resistant buds. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot and reverse transcription PCR confirmed the presence of the GUS gene. A transformation frequency of 13.1 % was achieved under optimized conditions for transformation (A. tumefaciens strain EHA105, 4 days co-cultivation at 4 A degrees C, and infection of the pre-cultured mature-seed explants for 2 days). This is the first report of a successful genetic transformation protocol for P. amurense.

AB Population genetic diversity in Tianshui city was analyzed with SSR markers in 605 single-pustule isolates of the stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), obtained from 19 varieties of wheat. Significant differences in genetic diversity among populations were defected. Genetic diversity was highest in population on Tian 863-13, a highly resistant variety, whereas genetic diversity was lowest in population on Huixianhong, a highly susceptible variety. Seven populations from seven varieties that carried the common Yr18 resistance gene were clustered as one sub-group at 0.88 similarity coefficient, which showed that resistance gene selection had close relation with pathogen's component. The results of present study can provide a theoretical basis for integrated management of wheat stripe rust and effective deployment of resistance genes in Pst over-summering zones in China.

AB In the present work we attempt to recover endogenous ancient DNA from cereal grains preserved under different conditions: charred, partially charred and waterlogged. A total of 126 grains from naked wheat and 18 from barley from different sites on the Eastern Iberian Peninsula ranging from the beginning of agriculture in the region to the turn of the Common Era, were studied. Two different extraction protocols were used, a standard phenol-chloroform method and a silica-based DNA extraction procedure implemented for artificially charred seeds. Amplifications were directed to three markers: the large subunit of ribulose 1,5 biphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) and the microsatellite WCT12 in the chloroplast genome and the x and y subunits of the high molecular weight glutenin gene (Glu-1) in the nucleus. The first two were used to assess the preservation status of the samples, while with the third we tried to identify the wheat grains at species level. It was possible to obtain eleven positive amplifications in 8 partially charred seeds but only two amplifications of the Glu-1 gene from a single sample of the Early Bronze age were genome-specific. Different contamination sources were identified and reported. Cloning and alignment of sequenced clones showed a correspondence of the amplified fragment to modern wheat D genome haplotypes. This result suggests that the sample corresponds to hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), thus being the first ancient DNA evidence to date for the cultivation of hexaploid wheat in the prehistoric agriculture of the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, obtained results highlight contamination problems associated to the study of ancient archaeobotanical charred seeds suggest that the combination of a silica-based extraction method together with the amplification of specific targets is a good strategy for recovering endogenous ancient DNA from this kind of material.

AB To study the D-genome of the wild wheat relative Aegilops tauschii Cosson at the hexaploid level, we developed a synthetic doubled-haploid (DH) hexaploid wheat population, SynDH3. This population was derived from the spontaneous chromosome doubling of triploid F-1 hybrid plants obtained from a cross between Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon PI377655 and A. tauschii ssp. strangulata AS66 x ssp. tauschii AS87. SynDH3 is a diploidization-hexaploid DH population containing recombinant D chromosomes from two different A. tauschii genotypes, with A and B chromosomes from T. turgidum being homogenous across the entire population. Using this population, we constructed a genetic map. Of the 440 markers used to construct the map, 421 (96%) were assigned to 12 linkage groups; these included 346 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 75 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The total map length of the seven D chromosomes spanned 916.27 cM, with an average length of 130.90 cM per chromosome and an average distance between markers of 3.47 cM. Seven segregation distortion regions were detected on seven linkage groups. Out of 50 markers shared with those on a common wheat map, 37 showed a consistent order. The utility of the diploidization-hexaploid DH population for mapping qualitative trait genes was confirmed using the dominant glaucousness-inhibiting gene W2(I) as an example.

TI Composition and functional analysis of low-molecular-weight glutenin
   alleles with Aroona near-isogenic lines of bread wheat

AB Background: Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) strongly influence the bread-making quality of bread wheat. These proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family located at the Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci on the short arms of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, and show high allelic variation. To characterize the genetic and protein compositions of LMW-GS alleles, we investigated 16 Aroona near-isogenic lines (NILs) using SDS-PAGE, 2D-PAGE and the LMW-GS gene marker system. Moreover, the composition of glutenin macro-polymers, dough properties and pan bread quality parameters were determined for functional analysis of LMW-GS alleles in the NILs.
   Results: Using the LMW-GS gene marker system, 14-20 LMW-GS genes were identified in individual NILs. At the Glu-A3 locus, two m-type and 2-4 i-type genes were identified and their allelic variants showed high polymorphisms in length and nucleotide sequences. The Glu-A3d allele possessed three active genes, the highest number among Glu-A3 alleles. At the Glu-B3 locus, 2-3 m-type and 1-3 s-type genes were identified from individual NILs. Based on the different compositions of s-type genes, Glu-B3 alleles were divided into two groups, one containing Glu-B3a, B3b, B3f and B3g, and the other comprising Glu-B3c, B3d, B3h and B3i. Eight conserved genes were identified among Glu-D3 alleles, except for Glu-D3f. The protein products of the unique active genes in each NIL were detected using protein electrophoresis. Among Glu-3 alleles, the Glu-A3e genotype without i-type LMW-GS performed worst in almost all quality properties. Glu-B3b, B3g and B3i showed better quality parameters than the other Glu-B3 alleles, whereas the Glu-B3c allele containing s-type genes with low expression levels had an inferior effect on bread-making quality. Due to the conserved genes at Glu-D3 locus, Glu-D3 alleles showed no significant differences in effects on all quality parameters.
   Conclusions: This work provided new insights into the composition and function of 18 LMW-GS alleles in bread wheat. The variation of i-type genes mainly contributed to the high diversity of Glu-A3 alleles, and the differences among Glu-B3 alleles were mainly derived from the high polymorphism of s-type genes. Among LMW-GS alleles, Glu-A3e and Glu-B3c represented inferior alleles for bread-making quality, whereas Glu-A3d, Glu-B3b, Glu-B3g and Glu-B3i were correlated with superior bread-making quality. Glu-D3 alleles played minor roles in determining quality variation in bread wheat. Thus, LMW-GS alleles not only affect dough extensibility but greatly contribute to the dough resistance, glutenin macro-polymers and bread quality.

AB Ingestion of wheat, barley, or rye triggers small intestinal inflammation in patients with celiac disease. Specifically, the storage proteins of these cereals (gluten) elicit an adaptive Th1-mediated immune response in individuals carrying HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 as major genetic predisposition. This well-defined role of adaptive immunity contrasts with an ill-defined component of innate immunity in celiac disease. We identify the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) CM3 and 0.19, pest resistance molecules in wheat, as strong activators of innate immune responses in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. ATIs engage the TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex and lead to up-regulation of maturation markers and elicit release of proinflammatory cytokines in cells from celiac and nonceliac patients and in celiac patients' biopsies. Mice deficient in TLR4 or TLR4 signaling are protected from intestinal and systemic immune responses upon oral challenge with ATIs. These findings define cereal ATIs as novel contributors to celiac disease. Moreover, ATIs may fuel inflammation and immune reactions in other intestinal and nonintestinal immune disorders.

AB Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play broad biological roles in plants. We report on a conserved receptor-like protein kinase (RPK) gene from wheat and other Triticeae species. The TaRPK1 was isolated from the Triticum aestivum cv. Prins - Triticum timopheevii introgression line IGVI-465 carrying the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm6. The TaRPK1 was mapped to homoeologous chromosomes 2A (TaRPK1-2A), 2D (TaRPK1-2D) and the Pm6-carrier chromosome 2G (TaRPK1-2G) of IGVI-465. Under the tested conditions, only the TaRPK1-2G allele was actively transcribed, producing two distinct transcripts via alternative splicing. The predicted 424-amino acid protein of TaRPK1-2G contained a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain, but lacked a typical extracellular domain. The expression of TaRPK1-2G gene was up-regulated upon the infection by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt) and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but down-regulated in response to treatments of SA and ABA. Over-expression of TaRPK1-2G in the powdery mildew susceptible wheat variety Prins by a transient expression assay showed that it slightly reduced the haustorium index of the infected Bgt. These data indicated that TaRPK1-2G participated in the defense response to Bgt infection and in the JA signaling pathway. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaRPK1-2G was highly conserved among plant species, and the amino acid sequence similarity of TaRPK1-2G among grass species was more than 86%. Based on its conservation, the RPK gene-based STS primers were designed, and used to amplify the RPK orthologs from the homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of all the tested Triticeae species, such as chromosome 2G of T. timopheevii, 2R of Secale cereale, 2H of Hordeum vulgare, 2S of Aegilops speltoides, 2S(l) of Ae. longissima, 2M(g) of Ae. geniculata, 2S(p) and 2U(p) of Ae. peregrina. The developed STS markers serve as conserved functional markers for the identification of homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of the Triticeae species.

AB An X-ray mutant showing an early flowering phenotype has been identified in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.), for which a major QTL for heading time was previously mapped in the telomeric region on the long arm of chromosome 3A. Recent advances in Triticeae genomics revealed that the gene order in this region is highly conserved between wheat and barley. Thus, we adopted a hypothetical gene order in barley, the so-called GenomeZipper, to develop DNA markers for fine mapping the target gene in wheat. We identified three genes tightly linked to the early heading phenotype. PCR analysis revealed that early-flowering is associated with the deletion of two genes in the mutant. Of the two deleted genes, one is an ortholog of the LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX)/PHYTOCLOCK 1 (PCL1) gene found in Arabidopsis, which regulates the circadian clock and flowering time. We found distorted expression patterns of two clock genes (TOC1 and LHY) in the einkorn pcl1 deletion mutant as was reported for the Arabidopsis lux mutant. Transcript accumulation levels of photoperiod-response related genes, a photoperiod sensitivity gene (Ppd-1) and two wheat CONSTANS-like genes (WCO1 and TaHd1), were significantly higher in the einkorn wheat mutant. In addition, transcripts of the wheat florigen gene (WFT) accumulated temporally under short-day conditions in the einkorn wheat mutant. These results suggest that deletion of WPCL1 leads to abnormally higher expression of Ppd-1, resulting in the accumulation of WFT transcripts that triggers flowering even under short-day conditions. Our observations from gene mapping, gene deletions, and expression levels of flowering related genes strongly suggest that WPCL1 is the most likely candidate gene for controlling the early flowering phenotype in the einkorn wheat mutant.

AB Construction of high-resolution genetic maps is important for genetic and genomic research, as well as for molecular breeding. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the,predominant class of genetic variation and can be used as molecular markers. Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of common wheat, is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. Our previous study implied that Ae. tauschii accessions can be genealogically divided into two major lineages. In this study, the transcriptome of two Ae. tauschii accessions from each lineage, lineage 1 (L1) and 2 (L2), was sequenced, yielding 9435 SNPs and 739 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels) after de novo assembly of the reads. Based on 36 contig sequences, 31 SNPs and six indels were validated on 20 diverse Ae. tauschii accessions. Because almost all of the SNP markers were polymorphic between L1 and L2, and the D-genome donor of common wheat is presumed to belong to L2, these markers are available for D-genome typing in crosses between common wheat varieties and L1-derived synthetic wheat. Due to the conserved synteny between wheat and barley chromosomes, the high-density expressed sequence tag barley map and the hypothetical gene order in barley can be applied to develop markers on target chromosomal regions in wheat.

AB Since the domestication of crop species, humans have derived specific varieties for particular uses and shaped the genetic diversity of these varieties. Here, using an interdisciplinary approach combining ethnobotany and population genetics, we document the within-variety genetic structure of a population-variety of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in relation to farmers practices to decipher their contribution to crop species evolution. Using 19 microsatellites markers, we conducted two complementary graph theory-based methods to analyze population structure and gene flow among 19 sub-populations of a single population-variety [Rouge de Bordeaux (RDB)]. The ethnobotany approach allowed us to determine the RDB history including diffusion and reproduction events. We found that the complex genetic structure among the RDB sub-populations is highly consistent with the structure of the seed diffusion and reproduction network drawn based on the ethnobotanical study. This structure highlighted the key role of the farmer-led seed diffusion through founder effects, selection and genetic drift because of human practices. An important result is that the genetic diversity conserved on farm is complementary to that found in the genebank indicating that both systems are required for a more efficient crop diversity conservation.

AB Agrobacterium, the natures' genetic engineer, has been used as a vector to create transgenic plants. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer in plants is a highly efficient transformation process which is governed by various factors including genotype of the host plant, explant, vector, plasmid, bacterial strain, composition of culture medium, tissue damage, and temperature of co-cultivation. Agrobacterium has been successfully used to transform various economically and horticulturally important monocot and dicot species by standard tissue culture and in planta transformation techniques like floral or seedling infilteration, apical meristem transformation, and the pistil drip methods. Monocots have been comparatively difficult to transform by Agrobacterium. However, successful transformations have been reported in the last few years based on the adjustment of the parameters that govern the responses of monocots to Agrobacterium. A novel Agrobacterium transferred DNA-derived nanocomplex method has been developed which will be highly valuable for plant biology and biotechnology. Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation is known to be the preferred method of creating transgenic plants from a commercial and biosafety perspective. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer predominantly results in the integration of foreign genes at a single locus in the host plant, without associated vector backbone and is also known to produce marker free plants, which are the prerequisites for commercialization of transgenic crops. Research in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation can provide new and novel insights into the understanding of the regulatory process controlling molecular, cellular, biochemical, physiological, and developmental processes occurring during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and also into a wide range of aspects on biological safety of transgenic crops to improve crop production to meet the demands of ever-growing world's population.

AB A synthetic autopolyploid was developed from diploid Aegilops tauschii, D genome progenitor of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). The tetraploid Ae. tauschii displayed a markedly larger organ size than the diploid donor. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and DNA marker analysis revealed that there is no clear variation at either the chromosomal or DNA level between the diploid and tetraploid plants. We analyzed the variation in cytosine methylation patterns between the diploid and tetraploid plants by methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) and detected 228 and 232 methylated sites in diploid and tetraploid plants, respectively. Statistical comparison indicated that the tetraploid Ae. tauschii genotype displayed no significant difference in polymorphic methylation level compared to the diploid ones. Twenty-two different genomic fragments displaying different methylation behavior during the ploidy conversions were isolated and sequenced. It demonstrated that alterations in the level of methylation have the most profound effects on coding genes. We demonstrated that there are some genes expressions modified by DNA methylation may be correlated with phenotypic alteration after autotetraploidization.

AB The research institute in Martonvasar is one of the largest agricultural research institutes in Hungary and in Central Europe. For many years now, the accumulated data on the extensive wheat breeding stocks has been handled and analysed using programs developed in the institute. The information system that has been elaborated and constantly improved can be used for keeping records of breeding stock, for planning field and laboratory experiments, for site-plant performance evaluation, for automated data collection, for the rapid evaluation of the results and for effective management of the pedigree, seed exchange and the institute's cereal gene bank.
   The demand for the storage of molecular data and their use in breeding has increased parallel with the development of new, PCR-based markers. For this reason, informatics tools (data structure and software) suited to the design of marker-assisted selection experiments and the interpretation of the results have been developed as part of the existing Martonvasar wheat breeding information system. The aim was to link molecular data to the phenotypic information already available in the database and to make the results available to wheat breeders and geneticists.
   The interpretation of molecular data related to specific genotypes is of assistance in clarifying the genetic background of economically important phenotypic traits, in identifying markers linked to the useful genes or agronomic traits to be found in the genomics database, and in the selection of satisfactory parental partners for breeding. Marker assisted selection coupled with traditional breeding activities enables the breeder to make plant selections based on the presence of target genes. Conventional wheat breeding with the integrated molecular component allows breeders to more accurately and efficiently select defined sets of genes in segregating generations.
   The molecular data are stored in a relational database, the central element of which is the [DNASource] entity. This is used to collect and store information on gene sources arising during breeding. It is therefore linked both to the phenotypic data stored in the traditional breeding system (measurements, observations, laboratory data) and to the component parts of the new, molecular data structure ([PrimerBank], [Marker], [Allele] and [Gene]).

AB The polyploid nature of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum, AABBDD) often represents a great challenge in various aspects of research including genetic mapping, map-based cloning of important genes, and sequencing and accurately assembly of its genome. To explore the utility of ancestral diploid species of polyploid wheat, sequence variation of T. urartu (A(u)A(u)) was analyzed by comparing its 277-kb large genomic region carrying the important Glu-1 locus with the homologous regions from the A genomes of the diploid T. monococcum (A(m)A(m)), tetraploid T. turgidum (AABB), and hexaploid T. aestivum (AABBDD). Our results revealed that in addition to a high degree of the gene collinearity, nested retroelement structures were also considerably conserved among the A(u) genome and the A genomes in polyploid wheats, suggesting that the majority of the repetitive sequences in the A genomes of polyploid wheats originated from the diploid A(u) genome. The difference in the compared region between A(u) and A is mainly caused by four differential TE insertion and two deletion events between these genomes. The estimated divergence time of A genomes calculated on nucleotide substitution rate in both shared TEs and collinear genes further supports the closer evolutionary relationship of A to A(u) than to A(m). The structure conservation in the repetitive regions promoted us to develop repeat junction markers based on the A(u) sequence for mapping the A genome in hexaploid wheat. Eighty percent of these repeat junction markers were successfully mapped to the corresponding region in hexaploid wheat, suggesting that T. urartu could serve as a useful resource for developing molecular markers for genetic and breeding studies in hexaploid wheat.

AB The goal of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the maintenance of wheat grain quality following post-anthesis heat stress in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. The response to heat stress was measured using the sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation test (SDSS), a significant predictor of bread baking quality. SDSS scores were used to identify QTLs associated with grain quality and QTLs associated with quality stability were identified based on percent change in SDSS score between the heat stress and control treatments. Four QTLs were identified, located one each on linkage groups 1B, 1D, 4A, and 7A. The 1B, 1D, and 4A QTLs were associated with grain quality; the QTL on linkage group 7A was associated with quality stability. To confirm the detected QTLs, eighty advanced lines grown at three Texas nurseries were tested for relationships between allelic polymorphism at QTL linked markers and quality traits. Quality trait stability in the advanced lines was estimated using the coefficient of variability (CV%) of quality traits between nurseries. The analysis supported the relationship of the predicted QTLs on linkage groups 1B, 1D, and 4A with quality traits. The confirmed QTLs may be used in marker assisted selection (MAS) to develop wheat lines possessing superior quality traits. In addition, identification of genetic regions associated with this trait will aid the identification of the underlying genes.

AB Ceratocystis wilt (CW) in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), caused by Ceratocystis cacaofunesta, is a drastic disease that results in plant death. The pathogen was recently identified in the major cacao-producing region of Brazil-Bahia. The identification of genetic markers tightly linked to disease resistance loci is a valuable tool for the development of resistant cultivars using marker-assisted selection (MAS). Branches of 143 six-year-old individuals of an F2 Sca 6 x ICS 1 population were wounded by making a 3-mm deep cut with a sterile scalpel, and inoculated with a 20-mu l drop of a spore suspension of 3 x 10(4) CFU/ml. The inoculation method used allowed the population to be quantitatively phenotyped. The length of the xylem discoloration followed a continuous distribution. These results imply that the resistance was quantitatively inherited. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed two genomic regions (in linkage groups 3 and 9) associated with CW resistance. The QTL explained individually from 6.9 to 8.6 % of the phenotypic variation. The QTL identified are crucial for identifying genes for resistance and can be applied in the genetic breeding of cacao using MAS.

AB Wheat cultivar VL404 carries seedling resistance to Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici pathotype TTKST. Monogenic segregation for seedling resistance was observed in a VL404/WL711 recombinant inbred line population and the resistance locus was temporarily designated SrVL. Bulked segregant analysis using Diversity Arrays Technology markers located SrVL on chromosome 2BL. Detailed simple sequence repeat mapping placed SrVL between gwm120 and wmc175, both at genetic distances of 3.3 cM. Based on adult plant responses of Janz and VL404 in India and Kenya, we expected these cultivars to carry the same gene against TTKST. A subset of Diamondbird/Janz doubled haploid (DH) population showed monogenic segregation, when tested against TTKST and the locus was temporarily named SrJNZ. SrVL-linked markers gwm120 and wmc175 flanked SrJNZ at a similar genetic distance, thereby confirming our hypothesis. Chromosome 2BL carries Sr9, Sr16 and Sr28. Sr9 is a multi-allelic locus and all known alleles of Sr9 and Sr16 are ineffective against TTKSK and its derivatives. A recombination value of 16.7 cM between Sr9g-linked stripe rust resistance gene Yr7 and SrJNZ in Diamondbird/Janz DH population suggested that SrJNZ is not an allele at the Sr9 locus. Based on comparison of published genetic distances between Lr13, Sr9, Sr28 and Sr16 with that observed in this study, we concluded SrVL and SrJNZ to be Sr28. This gene was contributed by a common parent Gabo, which also exhibited resistance against TTKST. Sr28-linked markers gwm120 and wmc175 confirmed the presence of this gene in a high proportion of Australian cultivars that showed stem rust resistance in Kenya. These markers can be used for marker-assisted pyramiding of Sr28 with other stem rust resistance genes.

AB Overexpressing TaUb2 promoted stem growth and resulted in early flowering in transgenic tobacco plants. Ubiquitin are involved in the production, metabolism and proper function of gibberellin.
   The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS), in which ubiquitin (Ub) functions as a marker, is a post-translational regulatory system that plays a prominent role in various biological processes. To investigate the impact of different Ub levels on plant growth and development, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants were engineered to express an Ub gene (TaUb2) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing TaUb2 demonstrated an accelerated growth rate at early stage and an early flowering phenotype in development. The preceding expression of MADS-box genes also corresponded to the accelerated developmental phenotypes of the transgenic tobacco plants compared to that of wild-type (WT). Total gibberellin (GA) and active GA contents in transgenic tobacco plants were higher than those in WT at the corresponding developmental stages, and some GA metabolism genes were upregulated. Treatment with GA(3) conferred a similarly accelerated grown rate in WT plants to that of transgenic tobacco plants, while growth was inhibited when transgenic tobacco plants were treated with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor. Thus, the results suggest that Ub are involved in the production, metabolism and proper function of GA, which is important in the regulation of plant growth and development.

AB Seven kinds of transgenic tobacco plants transformed with combinations of three FBE genes were obtained. The transgenic plants transformed with Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT genes appeared to have the highest fructan or soluble sugar content and the strongest salt tolerance.
   Fructan is thought to be one of the important regulators involved in plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. In this study, wheat-derived genes, Ta1-SST, Ta6-SFT, and Ta1-FFT, encoding fructan biosynthesis enzymes (FBE) were isolated and cloned into vectors modified pBI121 or pZP211. Seven different combinations of the three target genes were transformed into tobacco plants through an Agrobacterium-mediated approach, and transgenic tobacco plants were identified by PCR, ELISA, and Southern blotting. Compared with tobacco plants transformed with other six combinations of the three target genes and with wild-type plants, the transgenic plants transformed with Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT genes contained the highest fructan and soluble sugar content. All seven types of transgenic tobacco plants displayed a much higher level of tolerance to drought, low temperature, and high salinity compared with the wild type. Differences of drought and low temperature tolerance between the transgenic plants containing a single FBE gene and those harboring two or three FBE genes were not significant, but the salt tolerance level of the transgenic plants with different FBE gene combinations from high to low was: Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT > Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT + Ta1-FFT > Ta1-SST + Ta1-FFT > Ta1-SFT + Ta1-FFT > single FBE gene. These results indicated that the tolerances of the transgenic tobacco plants to various abiotic stresses were associated with the transformed target gene combinations and the contents of fructan and soluble sugar contained in the transgenic plants.

AB Facultative wheat varieties adapt to a particular environment. But the molecular basis for the facultative growth habit is not clear relative to winter and spring growth habit. Two sets of wheat varieties were chosen for this study. Set 1 comprised ten spring accessions and Set 2 comprised ten facultative accessions. All accessions had been tested by the previously described allele-specific markers and shown having the same allelic composition of vrn-A1 vrn-B1 Vrn-D1 and vrn-B3. Here we examined whether differences in growth habit might be associated with as yet unidentified sequence variation at Vrn-D1 locus. A region including the intron 1 deletion, the entire reading frame from a cDNA template and a part of promoter region of the dominant Vrn-D1 gene in each of the accessions was sequenced, and a single nucleotide polymorphism was found between facultative accessions and spring accessions in the CArG-box at the promoter region. The novel allele in facultative accessions was designated as Vrn-D1b. The investigation of an F-2 population segregating for Vrn-D1b and Vrn-D1a (previously, Vrn-D1) in the greenhouse under long days without vernalization showed that the plants with Vrn-D1b homozygous allele headed 32 days later and had about three more leaves than the plants with Vrn-D1a homozygous allele. As Vrn-D1b has the same deletion in intron 1 as Vrn-D1a, and, in addition, a single nucleotide mutation at promoter region, and is associated with facultative growth habit, we suggest that the promoter mutation may modify the basal activity level of an allele of VRN1 that is already active (due to the loss of segments in intron 1). Our finding further supports that both the promoter and intron 1 regulatory affect vernalization response and work independently.

AB The myeloblastosis oncogenes (MYB) are one of the important transcription factors that facilitate induction of various developmental and stress responsive genes. They are hence, emerging as key players in improving stress tolerance of plants in response to several abiotic stresses. Therefore, isolation and characterization of these genes, development of transgenics and functional molecular markers for useful alleles is central to various crop improvement programs. In this manuscript, we for the first time are reporting the identification of a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism associated with dehydration tolerance at 458th bp (an A/G transition) in the TaMYB2 gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and development of an allele-specific marker (ASM) for dehydration tolerance for the same. Further we validated this TaMYB2-ASM in a core set of 28 wheat cultivars which can be used for marker-assisted selection for dehydration tolerance in plant breeding programs.

AB The non-durable nature of hypersensitive (race-specific) resistance has stimulated scientists to search for other options such as race-non-specific resistance to provide long-lasting protection against plant diseases. Adult plant resistance gene complex Lr34/Yr18 confers a dual race-non-specific type of resistance to wheat against stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) and leaf rust (P. triticina Eriks). This study was conducted to evaluate 59 spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes for the presence of the Lr34/Yr18-linked csLV34 allele using STS marker csLV34 and to determine the effect of this gene complex on the components of partial resistance in wheat to leaf/stripe rust. Lr34/Yr18-linked csLV34 allele was detected only in 12 genotypes, namely Iqbal 2000, NR-281, NR 354, NR 363, NR 364, NR 366, NR 367, NR 370, NR 376, 4thEBWYT 509, 4thEBWYT 510 and 4thEBWYT 518. Eleven genotypes showing the amplified Lr34/Yr18-linked allele were further studied for the assessment of the effect of Lr34/Yr18 on components of partial resistance along with nine genotypes lacking this gene complex. Both stripe and leaf rusts were studied separately. The components of partial resistance including latency period (LP) and infection frequency (IF) were studied on primary leaf (seedling stage), fourth leaf and fully expanded young flag leaf (adult plant stage). Both the stripe and leaf rust fungi showed a prolonged LP and reduced IF on genotypes carrying Lr34/Yr18 gene complex. Generally, a longer LP was associated with a reduced IF at all growth stages. Although significant effect of Lr34/Yr18 gene complex on LP and IF was observed almost at all three growth stages, the effect was more pronounced at flag leaf. This suggested that Lr34/Yr18 gene complex is more effective at later stages of plant growth.

AB Common root rot (CRR) and spot blotch, caused by Cochliobolus sativus (Ito and Kurib.) Drechsl. ex Dast., are important diseases of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. However, the population biology of C. sativus is still poorly understood. In this study, the genetic structure of three C. sativus populations, consisting of isolates sampled respectively from barley leaves (BL), barley roots (BR) and wheat roots (WR) in North Dakota, was analysed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 127 AFLP loci were generated among 208 C. sativus isolates analysed with three primer combinations. Gene diversity (H = 0.277-0.335) were high in all three populations. Genetic variation among C. sativus individuals within population accounted for 74%, whereas 26% of the genetic variation was explained among populations. Genetic differentiation was high (empty set PT = 0.261, corrected G ''(st)= 0.39), whereas gene flow (Nm) ranged from 1.27 to 1.56 among the three populations analysed. The multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) ((r) over bard = 0.0760.117) was moderate in C. sativus populations. Cluster analyses indicate that C. sativus populations differentiated according to the hosts (barley and wheat) and tissues (root and leaf) although generalists also exist in North Dakota. Crop breeding may benefit from combining genes for resistance against both specialists and generalists of C. sativus.

AB The utility and commercial potential of genetically engineered (GE) plants would benefit from the use of site-specific recombination systems that enable efficient excision of the marker genes used to identify transformants. Although wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world, GE varieties have yet to be put into commercial production. To develop the Bxb1 recombination system (derived from the Mycobacterium smegmati bacteriophage Bxb1) for site-specific marker gene removal in transgenic wheat, we used biolistics to introduce into the wheat genome a codon optimized Bxb1 recombinase gene (BxbNom) under the control of the maize ubiquitin-1 promoter (Ubi1). Recombinase activity was monitored using a GUSPlus reporter gene activation assay. BxbNom recombinase-mediated excision of an att site-flanked stuffer DNA fragment activated beta-glucuronidase reporter activity in callus, endosperm, and leaves in transient assays. The system also detected activity in leaves and endosperm of progeny of multiple independent transgenic wheat lines stably expressing BxbNom. Our results demonstrate that the Bxb1 recombinase is heritable in transgenic wheat plants and performs site-specific excision, providing a useful tool for generating marker-free GE plants. Establishment of wheat lines capable of efficiently excising unneeded marker genes removes one potential barrier to commercial deployment of GE wheat.

AB Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy (sin. Haynaldia villosa) is an annual wild diploid grass species (2n = 2x = 14; genome VV) belonging to the Poaceae family, which is considered to be an important source of biotic and abiotic stress resistance genes for wheat breeding. Enhanced characterization of D. villosum chromosomes can facilitate exploitation of its gene pool and its use in wheat breeding programs. Here we present the cytogenetic identification of D. villosum chromosomes on slide by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with the GAA simple sequence repeat (SSR) as a probe. We also describe the isolation and the flow cytometric analysis of D. villosum chromosomes in suspension, resulting in a distinguished flow karyotype. Chromosomes were flow sorted into three fractions, according their DNA content, one of which was composed of a single type of chromosome, namely 6 V, sorted with over 85% purity. Chromosome 6 V is known to carry genes to code for important resistance and seed storage characteristics, and its isolation represents a new source of genetic traits and specific markers useful for wheat improvement.

AB Physical mapping and genome sequencing are underway for the approximate to 17 Gb wheat genome. Physical mapping methods independent of meiotic recombination, such as radiation hybrid (RH) mapping, will aid precise anchoring of BAC contigs in the large regions of suppressed recombination in Triticeae genomes. Reports of endosperm development following pollination with irradiated pollen at dosages that cause embryo abortion prompted us to investigate endosperm as a potential source of RH mapping germplasm. Here, we report a novel approach to construct RH based physical maps of all seven D-genome chromosomes of the hexaploid wheat 'Chinese Spring', simultaneously. An 81-member subset of endosperm samples derived from 20-Gy irradiated pollen was genotyped for deletions, and 737 markers were mapped on seven D-genome chromosomes. Analysis of well-defined regions of six chromosomes suggested a map resolution of similar to 830 kb could be achieved; this estimate was validated with assays of markers from a sequenced contig. We estimate that the panel contains similar to 6,000 deletion bins for D-genome chromosomes and will require similar to 18,000 markers for high resolution mapping. Map-based deletion estimates revealed a majority of 1-20 Mb interstitial deletions suggesting mutagenic repair of double-strand breaks in pollen provides a useful resource for RH mapping and map based cloning studies.

AB In this study, we present a 2nd generation genetic linkage map of a cross between the North American species Heterobasidion irregulare and H. occidentale, based on the alignment of the previously published 1st generation map to the parental genomes. We anchored 216 of the original 308 AFLP markers to their respective restriction sites using an in silico-approach. The map resolution was improved by adding 146 sequence-tagged microsatellite markers and 39 sequenced gene markers. The new markers confirmed the positions of the anchored AFLP markers, fused the original 39 linkage groups together into 17, and fully expanded 12 of these to single groups covering entire chromosomes. Map coverage of the genome increased from 55.3% to 92.8%, with 96.3% of 430 markers collinearly aligned with the genome sequence. The anchored map also improved the H. irregulare assembly considerably. It identified several errors in scaffold arrangements and assisted in reducing the total number of major scaffolds from 18 to 15. This denser, more comprehensive map allowed sequence-based mapping of three intersterility loci and one mating type locus. This demonstrates the possibility to utilize an in silico procedure to convert anonymous markers into sequence-tagged ones, as well as the power of a sequence-anchored linkage map and its usefulness in the assembly of a whole genome sequence.

AB Information on virulence and molecular diversity of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is a pre-requisite for mitigating the substantial yield losses caused by the stripe rust pathogen in Pakistan, the United States and other countries of the world. This study was undertaken to analyze both virulence and molecular diversity of 46 Pst isolates from Pakistan, in comparison with 9 US isolates. Avirulence to stripe rust resistance genes Yr5, Yr15 and YrSP was common among all tested isolates. Isolates from Pakistan had low virulence frequency for differentials carrying Yr2, (Yr10, YrMor) and (Yr2, Yr4a, YrYam). Clustering based on virulence data grouped contemporary isolates together and revealed high genetic diversity among pathotypes of both countries. Molecular analysis using sequence tagged site (STS) and microsatellites markers revealed high diversity based on polymorphic information contents (PIC)and marker index (MI) which was higher for SSRs (0.78 & 39.51, respectively) than STS markers(0.04 & 0.29, respectively). Dendrogram based on molecular marker data grouped together contemporary patbotypes indicating genetic similarity. Pathotypes belonging to both countries clustered together indicating common ancestry. Furthermore, very low correlation (r=0.08) was observed between virulence and molecular diversity showing independence in both trends of diversity. The depicted virulence pattern of Pst isolates will guide in devising cultivar improvement efforts for stripe rust resistance. (C) 2012 Friends Science Publishers

AB Grain dormancy provides protection against pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in cereals. Composite interval mapping and association analyses were performed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing grain dormancy in a doubled haploid (DH) barley population (ND24260 x Flagship) consisting of 321 lines genotyped with DArT markers. Harvest-ripe grain collected from three field experiments was germinated over a 7-day period to determine a weighted germination index for each line. DH lines displaying moderate to high levels of grain dormancy were identified; however, both parental lines were non-dormant and displayed rapid germination within the first two days of testing. Genetic analysis identified two QTL on chromosome 5H that were expressed consistently in each of the three environments. One QTL (donated by Flagship) was located close to the centromeric region of chromosome 5H (qSDFlag), accounting for up to 15% of the phenotypic variation. A second QTL with a larger effect (from ND24260) was detected on chromosome 5HL (qSDND), accounting for up to 35% of the phenotypic variation. qSDFlag and qSDND displayed an epistatic interaction and DH lines that had the highest levels of grain dormancy carried both genes. We demonstrate that qSDND in the ND24260 9 Flagship DH population is positioned proximal and independent to the well-characterised SD2 region that is associated with both high levels of dormancy and inferior malt quality. This indicates that it should be possible to develop cultivars that combine acceptable malting quality and adequate levels of grain dormancy for protection against PHS by utilizing these alternate QTL.

AB The Recombinant Inbred Lines in F-7 generation derived from two crosses (Ning8201 x Sonalika and Yangmai6 x Sonalika) along with parents were evaluated for varying degree of expression for staygreen, for two consecutive years in two replications. LAUG values ranged from 73.87 to 75.62 in staygreen parents, Ning8201 and Yangmai6, as compared to non-staygreen parent Sonalika (10.38). F-1 showed intermediate behaviour for staygreen expression indicating additive nature of inheritance for the trait. The distribution of RILs was normal indicating polygenic nature of the trait. Analysis of variance for LAUG displayed significant GxE interaction. Of the 119 SSR markers used in two crosses, 22 were polymorphic on parents. In Ning8201 x Sonalika, SSR markers WMC-10, WMC-74, and WMC-76 were significantly (p<0.001) linked with staygreen trait. In the other cross (Yangmai6 x Sonalika) the markers BARC-109, BARC-1120, BARC-04 and BARC-74 were significantly linked. The polymorphic markers for both crosses grouped under one linkage group (MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0b). Two QTLs were detected in Ning8201 x Sonalika cross (R-2=8.28) and (R-2=18.11). A major QTL was detected in Yangmai6 x Sonalika, which alone explained 44.34% of the phenotypic variation. The rest of the loci contributed on an average 12.9% to the total phenotypic variability. The linked markers obtained in the present study for staygreen trait can be used further for fine mapping and cloning of gene that can be used further for molecular assisted breeding in wheat.

AB Durable resistance to the rust diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can be achieved by developing lines that have race-nonspecific adult plant resistance conferred by multiple minor slow-rusting genes. Genomic selection (GS) is a promising tool for accumulating favorable alleles of slow-rusting genes. In this study, five CIMMYT wheat populations evaluated for resistance were used to predict resistance to stem rust (Puccinia graminis) and yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) using Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (BL), ridge regression (RR), and support vector regression with linear or radial basis function kernel models. All parents and populations were genotyped using 1400 Diversity Arrays Technology markers and different prediction problems were assessed. Results show that prediction ability for yellow rust was lower than for stem rust, probably due to differences in the conditions of infection of both diseases. For within population and environment, the correlation between predicted and observed values (Pearson's correlation [rho]) was greater than 0.50 in 90% of the evaluations whereas for yellow rust,. ranged from 0.0637 to 0.6253. The BL and RR models have similar prediction ability, with a slight superiority of the BL confirming reports about the additive nature of rust resistance. When making predictions between environments and/or between populations, including information from another environment or environments or another population or populations improved prediction.

AB The effects of the Rht8c, Rht-B1b, Rht-B1e, and Rht-D1b genes on wheat height have been investigated. Variations in these effects are significantly modified by the genetic background and year conditions. A combination of the Rht8c, Rht-B1a, Rht-D1b, and Ppd-D1a alleles is the most advantageous for the conditions of southern Ukraine, since it is associated with optimal plant height under contrasting conditions within different years. The genotypes of some varieties were shown to include gene(s) that were unidentifiable by the molecular markers and significantly decreased plant height.

AB Wild Secale species, Secale africanum Stapf., serve as a valuable source for increasing the diversity of cultivated rye (Secale cereale L.) and provide novel genes for wheat improvement. New wheat - S. africanum chromosome 1R(afr) addition, 1R(afr)(1D) substitution, 1BL.1R(afr)S and 1DS.1R(afr)L translocation, and 1R(afr)L monotelocentric addition lines were identified by chromosome banding and in situ hybridization. Disease resistance screening revealed that chromosome 1R(afr)S carries resistance gene(s) to new stripe rust races. Twenty-nine molecular markers were localized on S. africanum chromosome 1R(afr) by the wheat - S. africanum introgression lines. Twenty markers can also identically amplify other reported wheat - S. cereale chromosome 1R derivative lines, indicating that there is high conservation between the wild and cultivated Secale chromosome 1R. Nine markers displayed polymorphic amplification between S. africanum and S. cereale chromosome 1Rafr derivatives. The comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these polymorphic markers suggested that gene duplication and sequence divergence may have occurred among Secale species during its evolution and domestication.

AB The 1BL.1RS wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-rye (Secale cereale L.) translocation possesses genes Pm8, Yr9, Lr26, and Sr31 for resistance to several major fungal pathogens of small grain cereals. However, not all wheat cultivars with the 1RS translocation are resistant to Pm8-avirulent isolates of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), the causal pathogen of wheat powdery mildew. A suppressor is postulated to limit the function of Pm8 in certain genetic backgrounds, such as 'AGS 2000'. To illustrate the genetic basis of the suppressor in AGS 2000, a 178 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was used by crossing AGS 2000 with another 1BL.1RS cultivar Pioneer 26R61 (Pm8 effective). A single Bgt isolate, Ken-2-5, avirulent to Pm8 and virulent to Pm3a was chosen to inoculate the entire RIL population at the seedling stage. One major quantitative trait locus (QTL), QSuPm.uga-1AS, was stably detected as having an inhibiting effect on Pm8 in AGS 2000, and the QTL was postulated to be Pm3a based on its location. Further evidence of the Pm8-suppressing nature of Pm3a was obtained when eight lines from the 2010 Gulf Atlantic Wheat Nursery were inoculated with Ken-2-5. The eight lines all have Pm8 (1BL.1RS) but were susceptible, as they also have Pm3a. In addition, a functional locus, QPm.uga-7AL, was identified in Pioneer 26R61, where it accounted for up to 41% of phenotypic variation in resistance to isolate Ken-2-5. QPm.uga-7AL was flanked by simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Xcfa2257 and Xwmc525 on 7AL, and its relationship with other known Pm loci on this chromosome arm remains uncertain.

AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a highly heterozygous crop, is devastated by cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The discovery of the CMD2 dominant gene is helpful in the genetic analysis of CMD resistance. Molecular markers for CMD2 gene were used to introgress CMD resistance into Latin American cassava genotypes and validated in the field for 4 yr for stability of resistance conferred by CMD2. Field screening identified 64 Latin American genotypes with stable resistance to CMD. Resistance to CMD of two Nigerian cassava cultivars (TMS 97/2205 and TMS 98/0505) was analyzed with markers and in the field. Molecular data indicated that CMD resistance in the two Nigerian cultivars was mediated by the CMD2 gene. Results showed TMS 97/2205 to be highly resistant to CMD in three ecological zones in Nigeria. Further genetic analysis of this genotype as a source of high level of resistance to CMD using a segregating F-1 population derived from a TMS 97/2205 x NR 8083 cross was initiated using 530 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for CMD resistance. A marker (NS198) associated with a QTL for CMD resistance, explaining 11% of the phenotypic variance observed, was identified. The combined effect of this QTL and CMD2 may account for the high level of resistance of TMS 97/2205. The resistance profile of the evaluated CMD2 genotypes in growth cycle was not uniform and was affected by genetic background. The discovery of a new QTL (CMD3) for CMD resistance in TMS 97/2205 offers new opportunities for pyramiding CMD genes for enhanced durability of CMD resistance in cassava.

AB Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn., is one of the major diseases of wheat throughout the world. New P. graminis f. sp. tritici races including Ug99 (strain TTKS) and its variants, as well as local stem rust races, pose a serious threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in Pakistan. Identifying resistance genes effective against the prevalent races and incorporating these genes into adapted wheat varieties can contribute to stem rust control. In this study, 117 Pakistani wheat varieties were screened with 18 DNA markers to detect the presence of stem rust resistance genes Sr2, Sr6, Sr22, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr31, and Sr38. Stem rust resistance genes Sr22, Sr24, Sr25, and Sr26 were absent from all varieties, whereas Sr2, Sr6, Sr31, and Sr38 were present at various frequencies. The highest frequency was observed for Sr2 (9-79% by different markers), followed by Sr31 (35%), Sr6 (11%), and Sr38 (9%). These results indicated that Pakistani varieties are being protected by very few resistance genes and lack resistance genes potentially effective against new stem rust races. Therefore, there is a need to incorporate stem rust resistance genes Sr22, Sr24, Sr25, and Sr26 into Pakistani wheat varieties. Different markers used for adult plant resistance gene Sr2 indicated different frequencies of this gene in the tested varieties. More reliable and efficient markers need to be developed for marker-assisted selection of this and other genes.

AB Worldwide germplasm collections contain about 7.4 million accessions of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. One of the 10 largest ex situ genebanks of our globe is located at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in Gatersleben, Germany. Molecular tools have been used for various gene bank management practices including characterization and utilization of the germplasm. The results on genetic integrity of long-term-stored gene bank accessions of wheat (self-pollinating) and rye (open-pollinating) cereal crops revealed a high degree of identity for wheat. In contrast, the out-pollinating accessions of rye exhibited shifts in allele frequencies. The genetic diversity of wheat and barley germplasm collected at intervals of 40 to 50 years in comparable geographical regions showed qualitative rather than a quantitative change in diversity. The inter- and intraspecific variation of seed longevity was analysed and differences were detected. Genetic studies in barley, wheat and oilseed rape revealed numerous QTL, indicating the complex and quantitative nature of seed longevity. Some of the loci identified were in genomic regions that co-localize with genes determining agronomic traits such as spike architecture or biotic and abiotic stress response. Finally, a genome-wide association mapping analysis of a core collection of wheat for flowering time was performed using diversity array technology (DArT) markers. Maker trait associations were detected in genomic regions where major genes or QTL have been described earlier. In addition, new loci were also detected, providing opportunities to monitor genetic variation for crop improvement.

AB Wheat stripe rust is a devastating disease in many regions of the world. In wheat, 49 resistance genes for stripe rust have been officially documented, but only three genes are cloned, including the race-specific resistance Yr10 candidate gene (Yr10(CG)) and slow-rusting genes Lr34/Yr18 (hereafter designated as Yr18) and Yr36. In this study, we developed gene-specific markers for these genes and used them to screen a collection of 659 wheat accessions, including 485 Chinese cultivars. Thirteen percent and eleven percent of the tested Chinese cultivars were positive for the markers for Yr10(CG) and Yr18(RH) (the resistant haplotype of Yr18), respectively, but none were positive for the Yr36 marker. Since there is a limited use of the Yr10 gene in Chinese wheat, the relatively high frequency of wheat varieties with the Yr10(CG) marker suggests that the identity of the Yr10 gene is unknown. With regards to the Yr18 gene, 29% of the tested cultivars that are used in the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valleys' winter wheat zone were positive for Yr18(RH) markers. A non-functional allele of Yr18(RH) was identified in 'Mingxian 169', a commonly used susceptible check for studying stripe rust. The data presented here will provide useful information for marker-assisted selection for wheat stripe rust resistance.

AB The Russian wheat aphid (RWA) is one of the most aggressive pests of barley and wheat. The outbreak of RWA occurred in Argentina in 2008 caused serious damage to barley cultivars. The most effective and sustainable method of RWA control is to identify new resistance genes. The purpose of the current research was to map RWA resistance genes in a set of double haploid (DH) lines of the Oregon-Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population derived from the cross between OWBDOM and OWBREC. The DH and both parental lines were screened for antixenosis, tolerance and antibiosis to RWA. There was significant variation among the DH lines in most of the traits studied. However, only tolerance resulted in significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the molecular markers. Two main QTLs were identified. These explained 90 and 79 % of the variability of foliar area and chlorophyll content, respectively, of infested and control plants. The initial and final foliar area and the variation in foliar area were associated with the same molecular markers on chromosome 2H (BmAc0125, Vrs1, BmAc0144f and BmAg0113e). The positive alleles were provided by OWBDOM. The content of chlorophyll was associated with the marker loci WMC1E8, MWG912, ABC261, MWG2028 and Blp on chromosome 1H, with the positive alleles provided by OWBREC. Both parents contributed to different tolerance traits, with foliar area and chlorophyll content remaining as the plant traits most affected by aphid feeding. The QTLs found in this population are new RWA resistance loci. A sequence homology search was performed to derive the putative function of the genes linked to the QTLs.

AB Traits related to spike morphology (SM), including grain density (GD), spike length (SL) and awn length (AL), are of central importance in cereal improvement. A recent study based on a two-row landrace of barley, TX9425, detected QTL controlling all of the three traits in a similar region on the long arm of chromosome 3H. To further characterize this chromosomal region, 12 pairs of near isogenic lines (NILs) for GD were generated from two populations between TX9425 and two different commercial cultivars. A population consisting of 1,028 lines segregating primarily for the target region was also developed using materials generated during the production of these NILs. Results from the analysis of the NILs and the NIL-derived population showed that these three traits were likely controlled by a single-locus which was mapped to a 2.84 cM interval between two SSR markers, GBM1495 and HVM33. Across the 12 pairs of NILs, the presence of the 3HL locus increased GD by 53.4 %, reduced SL and AL by 38.8 % and 62.7 %, respectively. In the NIL-derived population, the presence of the 3HL locus increased GD by 64.6 %, reduced SL and AL by 33.7 % and 62.6 %, respectively. An interesting question arising from this research is why some loci such as the one reported here affect several SM-related traits while others appear to affect one of these traits only. The NILs and the NIL-derived population generated in this study will help answer such questions by providing the germplasm to enable cloning and comparative analysis of the genes responsible for these SM-related traits.

AB Genetic studies were undertaken to determine the inheritance and genomic location of uncharacterised seedling resistance to leaf rust, caused by Puccinia hordei, in the barley cultivar Ricardo. The resistance was shown to be conferred by a single dominant gene, which was tentatively designated RphRic. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) and genetic mapping of an F-3 mapping population using multiplex-ready SSR genotyping and Illumina GoldenGate SNP assay located RphRic in chromosome 4H. Given that this is the first gene for leaf rust resistance mapped on chromosome 4H, it was designated Rph21. The presence of an additional gene, Rph2, in Ricardo, was confirmed by the test of allelism. The seedling gene Rph21 has shown effectiveness against all Australian pathotypes of P. hordei tested since at least 1992 and hence represents a new and useful source of resistance to this pathogen.

AB Powdery mildew is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in areas with cool and maritime climates. Chinese wheat landrace Baihulu confers a high level of resistance against a wide range of Blumeria graminis DC f. sp. tritici (Bgt) races, especially those currently prevailing in Shaanxi. The objectives of this study were to determine the chromosome bin location of the mlbhl gene from Baihulu and its allelism with Pm24. To investigate the inheritance of powdery mildew resistance and detect adjacent molecular markers, we constructed a segregating population of 301 F-2 plants and corresponding F-2:3 families derived from Baihulu/Shaanyou 225. Genetic analysis revealed that a single dominant gene was responsible for seedling stage powdery mildew resistance in Baihulu. A genetic map comprising Xgwm106, Xgwm337, Xgwm1675, Xgwm603, Xgwm789, Xbarc229, Xgpw4503, Xcfd72, Xcfd83, Xcfd59, Xcfd19, and mlbhl spanned 28.2 cM on chromosome 1D. Xgwm603/Xgwm789 and Xbarc229 were flanking markers tightly linked to mlbhl at genetic distances of 1.5 and 1.0 cM, respectively. The mlbhl locus was located in chromosome bin 1DS 0.59-1.00 delimited by the SSR markers Xgwm337 and Xbarc229. When tested with a differential array of 23 Bgt isolates Baihulu displayed a response pattern that was clearly distinguishable from that of Chiyacao and varieties or lines possessing documented Pm genes. Allelism analysis indicated that mlbhl is a new gene, either allelic or closely linked with Pm24. The new gene was designated Pm24b.

AB Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with androgenic responsiveness in triticale were analyzed using a population of 90 DH lines derived from the F1 cross between inbred line 'Saka 3006' and cv. 'Modus', which was used in a number of earlier studies on molecular mapping in this crop. Using Windows QTL Cartographer and MapQTL 5.0, composite interval mapping (CIM) and association studies (Kruskal-Wallis test; K-W) for five androgenesis parameters (androgenic embryo induction, total regeneration and green plant regeneration ability, and two characteristics describing final androgenesis efficiency) were conducted. For the studied components of androgenic response, CIM detected in total 28 QTLs which were localized on 5 chromosomes from A and R genomes. Effects of all QTLs that were identified at 2.0 or above of the LOD score explained 5.1-21.7 % of the phenotypic variation. Androgenesis induction was associated with seven QTLs (LOD between 2.0 and 5.8) detected on chromosomes 5A, 4R, 5R and 7R, all of them confirmed by K-W test as regions containing the markers significantly linked to the studied trait. What is more, K-W test revealed additional markers on chromosomes: 5A, 2BL, 7B and 5R. Both total and green regeneration ability were controlled by genes localized on chromosome 4A. Some of the QTLs that affected final androgenesis efficiency were identical with those associated with androgenic embryo induction efficiency, suggesting that the observed correlation may be either due to tight linkage or to pleiotropy.
   Key message Five regions of the triticale genome were indicated as revealing significant marker/trait association. Markers located in these regions are potentially useful for triticale breeding through marker-assisted selection.

AB Granule bound starch synthase 1 (GBSS1) accumulation within starch granules and structure of Gbss1 alleles were determined for nine barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes producing amylose-free (undetectable), near-waxy (1.6-4.5%), normal (25.8%), and increased (38.0-40.8%) amylose grain starches. Compared to normal starch granules, GBSS1 accumulation was severely reduced in three near-waxy, slightly reduced in two waxy, and slightly elevated in three increased amylose starches. Gbss1 nucleotide sequence analysis for the nine genotypes distinguished them into three Gbss1 groups with several single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A new unique Q312H substitution within GBSS1 was discovered in near-waxy genotype SB94912 with reduced amylose (1.6%) concentration relative to the other two near-waxy lines, CDC Rattan and CDC Candle (4.5%). The two waxy genotype GBSS1 showed a previously described D287V change for CDC Alamo and a new G513W change for CDC Fibar. Both amino acid alterations are conserved residues within starch synthase domains involved in glucan interaction. The increased amylose genotypes showed several unique nucleotide changes within the second and fourth Gbss1 introns, but only SB94893 GBSS1 showed a unique amino acid substitution, A250T in exon 6. The Gbss1 nucleotide differences were used to design genetic markers to monitor Gbss1 alleles in genotypes with various amylose grain starches.

AB Background: Cereal storage proteins represent one of the most important sources of protein for food and feed and they are coded by multigene families. The expression of the storage protein genes exhibits a temporal fluctuation but also a response to environmental stimuli. Analysis of temporal gene expression combined with genetic variation in large multigene families with high homology among the alleles is very challenging.
   Results: We designed a rapid qRT-PCR system with the aim of characterising the variation in the expression of hordein genes families. All the known D-, C-, B-, and gamma-hordein sequences coding full length open reading frames were collected from commonly available databases. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the members of the different hordein families were classified into subfamilies. Primer sets were designed to discriminate the gene expression level of whole families, subfamilies or individual members. The specificity of the primer sets was validated before successfully applying them to a cDNA population derived from developing grains of field grown Hordeum vulgare cv. Barke. The results quantify the number of moles of transcript contributed to a particular gene family and its subgroups. More over the results indicate the genotypic specific gene expression.
   Conclusions: Quantitative RT-PCR with SYBR Green labelling can be a useful technique to follow gene expression levels of large gene families with highly homologues members. We showed variation in the temporal expression of genes coding for barley storage proteins. The results imply that our rapid qRT-PCR system was sensitive enough to identify the presence of alleles and their expression profiles. It can be used to check the temporal fluctuations in hordein expressions or to find differences in their response to environmental stimuli. The method could be extended for cultivar recognition as some of the sequences from the database originated from cv. Golden Promise were not expressed in the studied barley cultivar Barke although showed primer specificity with their cloned DNA sequences.

AB A previous study provided an in-depth understanding of molecular population genetics of European and Asian wheat gene pools using a sequenced 3.1-Mb contig (ctg954) on chromosome 3BS. This region is believed to carry the Fhb1 gene for response to Fusarium head blight. In this study, 266 wheat accessions were evaluated in three environments for Type II FHB response based on the single floret inoculation method. Hierarchical clustering (UPGMA) based on a Manhattan dissimilarity matrix divided the accessions into eight groups according to five FHB-related traits which have a high correlation between them; Group VIII comprised six accessions with FHB response levels similar to variety Sumai 3. Based on the compressed mixed linear model (MLM), association analysis between five FHB-related traits and 42 molecular markers along the 3.1-Mb region revealed 12 significant association signals at a threshold of P<0.05. The highest proportion of phenotypic variation (6.2%) in number of diseased spikelets (NDS) occurred at locus cfb6059, and the physical distance was about 2.9 Kb between umn10 and this marker. Haplotype block (HapB) analysis using a sliding window LD of 5 markers, detected six HapBs in the 3.1-Mb region at r(2)>0.1 and P<0.001 between random closely linked markers. F-tests among Haps with frequencies >0.05 within each HapB at r(2)>0.1 and P<0.001 showed significant differences between the Hap carried by FHB resistant resources, such as Sumai 3 and Wangshuibai, and susceptible genotypes in HapB3 and HapB6. These results suggest that Fhb1 is located within HapB6, with the possibility that another gene is located at or near HapB3. SSR markers and Haps detected in this study will be helpful in further understanding the genetic basis of FHB resistance, and provide useful information for marker-assisted selection of Fhb1 in wheat breeding.

It has been indicated that PBW65 expresses non-hypersensitive type of resistance against race 77-5. F-2 and F-3 crossing of PBW65 with WL711, a leaf rust susceptible wheat cultivar, and allelic tests with such already known genes (present in cultivars RL 6058 and BD 2009) revealed that cultivar PBW65 could be a potential source of novel non-hypersensitive leaf rust resistance genes. So far, only non-hypersensitive leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 was found to be effective under Indian conditions. Attempts to locate such durable leaf rust resistance genes in PBW65 through microsatellite markers showed 2B, 2D and 3D as critical chromosomes for PBW65. The primer Xgwm341 (3D) was found located 41.5 cM away from gene LrPBWI in PBW65.

AB Rust and powdery mildew diseases of wheat are among the oldest and most harmful diseases confining the yield of wheat worldwide. Development of resistant wheat cultivars with durable or race-nonspecific resistance genes is the main objective for many breeding programs. One of these genes, Lr34/Yr18/Pm38, was found to confer partial and durable resistance against rust pathogens as well as powdery mildew. This multiple disease resistant locus was recently found to comprise a single gene, which encodes an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter (ABC-transporter) of the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) subfamily. Differences in the alleles of resistant and susceptible cultivars enabled to develop six allele-specific markers. In this study, 46 different Turkish bread wheat cultivars were screened using these specific markers, which indicated that 13 cultivars carry the resistance allele of that gene. To compare this molecular finding with phenotypic observations, a field trial with artificial inoculation of Puccinia recondita was performed. Interestingly, all cultivars having the resistance allele were found to be susceptible. Although Lr34 has mediated resistance against leaf rust for over 40 years and has been used globally as an effective component of rust resistance in many breeding programs, this adult plant resistance is ineffective in the studied Turkish bread wheat cultivars.

AB Members of the core pooids represent the most important crops in temperate zones including wheat, barley, and oats. Their importance as crops is largely due to the grain, particularly the storage capabilities of the endosperm. In this study, a comprehensive survey of grain morphology and endosperm organization in representatives of wild and cultivated species throughout the core pooids was performed. As sister to the core pooid tribes Poeae, Aveneae, Triticeae, and Bromeae within the Pooideae subfamily, Brachypodium provides a taxonomically relevant reference point. Using macroscopic, histological, and molecular analyses distinct patterns of grain tissue organization in these species, focusing on the peripheral and modified aleurone, are described. The results indicate that aleurone organization is correlated with conventional grain quality characters such as grain shape and starch content. In addition to morphological and organizational variation, expression patterns of candidate gene markers underpinning this variation were examined. Features commonly associated with grains are largely defined by analyses on lineages within the Triticeae and knowledge of grain structure may be skewed as a result of the focus on wheat and barley. Specifically, the data suggest that the modified aleurone is largely restricted to species in the Triticeae tribe.

AB Semi-dwarfism is an agronomically important trait in breeding for resistance to damage by wind and rain (lodging resistance) and for stable high yields. Dwarf Polish wheat (Triticum polonicum L., 2n = 4x = 28, AABB AS304) is a potential donor of dwarfing and other traits for common wheat improvement. A genetic analysis using an F-2 population derived from a cross of AS304 and tall cultivar AS302 and derived F-2:3 lines indicated that AS304 carries a recessive dwarfing gene, temporarily designated Rht-dp. Molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis were used to characterize and map the gene. Eight polymorphic SSR markers (Xwmc511, Xgwm495, Xgwm 113, Xgwm192, Xgpw7026, Xgpw3017, Xgpw1108 and Xgpw7521) on chromosome arm 4BS and two AFLP markers (M (8) /E (5) and M (4) /E (3) ) were mapped relative to the dwarfing locus. The closest linked markers, Xgpw3017 and M (8) /E (5) at 0.5 and 3.5 cM, respectively, from Rht-dp will enable its marker assisted transfer to wheat breeding populations. Allelic tests indicated that Rht-dp was allelic to Rht-B1b; hence it may be an alternative allele at the Rht-B1 locus.

AB species are susceptible to infection by microbial pathogens that severely affect their growth and substantially decrease their economic value. In this study, two pathogenesis-related protein genes consisting of Beauveria bassiana chitinase (Bbchit1) and motherwort lipid-transfer protein (LJAMP2) were introduced into Chinese white poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using the hygromycin (hyg) and neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) genes as selectable markers, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the stable integration of transgenes in the genome of transgenic plants. In vitro assays showed that inhibitory activity against the fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler was evident from the crude leaf extracts from transgenic plants. Importantly, the double-transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher resistance to the pathogen than either of the single-gene transformants and wild-type plants when inoculated with A. alternata. The level of disease reduction in double-transgenic lines was between 82 and 95%, whereas that of single-gene transformants carrying either LJAMP2 or Bbchit1 was between 65 and 89%. These results indicated that the combined expression of the LJAMP2 and Bbchit-1 genes could significantly enhance resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens in poplar.

AB Common lambsquarters is highly competitive in many cropping systems and has demonstrated resistance to several herbicide mechanisms of action. However, predicting the spread of resistance is difficult due to limited information about gene flow. We conducted research to determine the potential for movement of resistance alleles in common lambsquarters under field conditions. Chenopodium giganteum (a member of the C album aggregate) that has a dominant magenta phenotypic marker was used as a pollen parent in gene flow experiments. A wild-type accession of common lambsquarters was used as a seed parent. Seed parents were grown in a soybean field and arranged in concentric circles 2 to 15 m from a center which contained 24 pollen parents. The concentric circles were divided into eight directions. Pollen movement was estimated by determining the percentage of progeny with the magenta phenotype from seed parents. Average cross-pollination across directions was greatest (3.0%) at 2 m and decreased to low levels (0.16%) 15 m from the center, consistent with observations of other primarily self-pollinated species. Cross-pollination was greatest (P < 0.10) in the south-southwest, west-southwest, and west-northwest directions, approximately 180 degrees from the prevailing wind direction during the time of pollen shed. Since common lambsquarters does not have an active dispersal mechanism for seeds, pollen-mediated gene flow may play an important role in the transfer and frequency of resistance alleles within and between populations.

AB Stripe rust is one of major diseases in wheat production worldwide. The best economic and efficient method is to utilize resistant varieties. Alturas has high-temperature adult-plant resistance. In order to determine stripe rust resistance characteristics, resistance gene combination and molecular map of the resistance gene(s), Alturas was crossed with Chinese susceptible cultivar Taichung29. The parents, F-1, F-2 progenies were tested with Chinese predominant mixed races CYR31, CYR32 and CYR33 in field experiments in 2010 and F-3 progenies were evaluated at one site in Beijing, the other site in Langfang, Hebei Province. Infection type (IT) and disease severity (DS) were recorded three times for each plant for F-1 and F-2, and each progeny for F-3 during each growing season. The DS data were used to calculate relative area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values. Both IT and AUDPC data showed continuous distributions, indicating that the Alturas HTAP resistance was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A major HTAP QTL, designated as QYrAlt.syau-3BS, was consistently detected across environments and was located on chromosome 3BS. The gene contributed to 34.28 % of the phenotypic variation for average AUDPC and 50.20 % for average IT. Markers Xgwm389 and Xbarc238 flanking the major QTL, should be useful in breeding for obtaining durable and high-level resistance by combinations with other non-race-specific resistance genes.

However, traditional analysis by protein electrophoresis is sometimes difficult and not very precise. This work describes a novel DNA marker for accurate discrimination between the Glu-B1 locus subunits Bx7 and Bx7*. An analysis of 142 bread wheat varieties from different countries identified a considerable number of misclassified genotypes that could lead to incorrect conclusions in studies of the relationship between glutenin composition and wheat quality.

AB Flowering time is a decisive factor in the adaptation of oat. Some oat varieties require low temperatures for floral initiation, a process called vernalization. The objectives of this study were to clone, characterize, and map genes associated with vernalization in oat, and to identify markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect vernalization response. Genetic linkage maps were developed using Diversity Arrays Technology markers in recombinant inbred lines from the oat populations UFRGS 8 x UFRGS 930605 and UFRGS 881971 x Pc68/5*Starter. Flowering time and response to vernalization were characterized using field trials and controlled greenhouse experiments, and QTL were identified in two genetic regions on each of the two maps. PCR primer pairs anchored in the conserved coding regions of the Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 genes from wheat, barley, and Lolium were used to amplify and clone corresponding oat sequences. Cloned sequences corresponding to the targeted genes were recovered for both Vrn1 and Vrn3. A copy of the Vrn3 gene was mapped using a PCR amplicon, and an oat Vrn1 fragment was mapped by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.

AB Gibberellins (GAs) are important phytohormones in plants. GAs promote plant growth by inducing the degradation of DELLA proteins, which serve as GA signal repressors. The semi-dwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, derived from the Japanese variety Norin 10, are gain-of-function mutant alleles of the reduced height-1 genes (Rht-B1 and Rht-D1) encoding wheat DELLA proteins. Wheat varieties carrying these Rht alleles are shorter and insensitive to the GA response. At the Rht-B1 loci, an alternative GA-insensitive dwarfing gene, Rht-B1e, was found in the Russian mutant of Bezostaya1, or Krasznodari 1, by breeders, but its molecular mechanism for causing dwarfism remains unknown. In this study, the Rht-B1e allele was isolated using homology-based cloning. Sequence comparison between Rht-B1e and the wild-type Rht-B1a revealed an A-to-T substitution at nucleotide position 181 in Rht-B1e, which introduced a stop codon into the DELLA domain. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of Rht-B1e and Rht-B1b showed that the stop codon position in Rht-B1e was earlier than that of Rht-B1b by three amino acid residues, and it was also followed closely by several methionines, which may permit translational re-initiation, as seen in Rht-B1b. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the predicted Rht-B1e proteins did not interact with the GA receptor GID1 in the presence of GA, suggesting that the stop codon mutation in the DELLA domain is the molecular cause of GA insensitivity and dwarfism conferred by Rht-B1e in wheat. Meanwhile, we developed an allele-specific PCR marker for Rht-B1e, which may facilitate the use of the Rht-B1e dwarfing gene in wheat breeding programs.

AB Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) is considered to be one of the most important diseases in winter wheat regions of the central and southeastern United States. Utilization of resistant cultivars is the most efficient and environmentally friendly means of control. To identify potential quantitative trait loci (QTL) or effective gene(s) for SBWMV resistance, two independent recombinant inbred line populations, Pioneer 26R61/AGS 2000 (PR61/A2000, 178 lines) and AGS 2020/LA 95135 (A2020/LA, 130 lines), were developed. Pioneer 26R61 and AGS 2020 were resistant to SBWMV, and AGS 2000 and LA 95135 were susceptible. Based on the whole genome genotyping for the PR61/A2000 population and targeted mapping of chromosome 5D for the A2020/LA, the same major QTL QSbm.uga-5DL was identified in all environments with highly significant LOD values, explaining up to 62 and 65 % of the total phenotypic variation in the PR61/A2000 and A2020/LA populations, respectively. The location of the resistance QTL coincided with previously published SBCMV resistance genes Sbm1, Sbm (Claire) and Sbm (Tremie) on the long arm of chromosome 5D. A conserved locus was therefore proposed for conditioning SBWMV/SBCMV resistance in common wheat. Validation of the QTL using the flanking markers Xbarc177 and Xbarc161 in three cultivars and three elite lines with Pioneer 26R61 in their pedigrees indicated that the markers were suitable for marker-assisted selection.

AB Restoration of male fertility is a prerequisite for hybrid rye breeding and currently the most straightforward approach to minimize ergot infection in hybrid rye varieties. Molecular markers are important tools for the efficient introgression and management of restorer genes like Rfp1 originating from unadapted genetic resources. Furthermore, closely linked markers flanking Rfp1 are indispensible for identifying and selecting individuals with haplotypes showing recombination between Rfp1 and other gene(s) that reside in close proximity and have a negative influence on yield. We identified orthologous gene sets in rice, Brachypodium, and Sorghum and used these gene models as templates to establish conserved ortholog set (COS) markers for the restorer gene Rfp1 on the long arm of rye chromosome 4R. The novel co-dominant markers delimit Rfp1 within a 0.7-cM interval and allow prediction of Rfp1 genotypes with a precision not feasible before. The COS markers enabled an alignment of the improved genetic map of rye chromosome 4R with wheat and barley maps and allowed identification of regions orthologous to Rfp1 in wheat and barley on the short arms of chromosomes 6D and 6H, respectively. Results obtained in this study revealed that micro-collinearity around the Rfp1 locus in rye is affected by rearrangements relative to other grass genomes. The impact of the novel COS markers for practical hybrid rye breeding is discussed.

AB An autophagy-related gene Atg8 was cloned for the first time from wild emmer wheat, named as TdAtg8, and its role on autophagy under abiotic stress conditions was investigated. Examination of TdAtg8 expression patterns indicated that Atg8 expression was strongly upregulated under drought stress, especially in the roots when compared to leaves. LysoTracker(A (R)) red marker, utilized to observe autophagosomes, revealed that autophagy is constitutively active in Triticum dicoccoides. Moreover, autophagy was determined to be induced in plants exposed to osmotic stress when compared to plants grown under normal conditions. Functional studies were executed in yeast to confirm that the TdATG8 protein is functional, and showed that the TdAtg8 gene complements the atg8a dagger::kan MX yeast mutant strain grown under nitrogen deficiency. For further functional analysis, TdATG8 protein was expressed in yeast and analyzed using Western immunoblotting. Atg8-silenced plants were exposed to drought stress and chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content measurements demonstrated that Atg8 plays a key role on drought stress tolerance. In addition, Atg8-silenced plants exposed to osmotic stress were found to have decreased Atg8 expression level in comparison to controls. Hence, Atg8 is a positive regulator in osmotic and drought stress response.

AB Bread as a staple food product represents an important source for dietary fibre consumption. Effects of wheat bread, wholemeal wheat bread and wholemeal rye bread on mechanisms which could have impact on chemoprevention were analysed in colon cells after in vitro fermentation.
   Effects of fermented bread samples on gene expression, glutathione S-transferase activity and glutathione content, differentiation, growth and apoptosis were investigated using the human colon adenoma cell line LT97. Additionally, apoptosis was studied in normal and tumour colon tissue by determination of caspase activities.
   The expression of 76 genes (biotransformation, differentiation, apoptosis) was significantly upregulated (1.5-fold) in LT97 cells. The fermented bread samples were able to significantly increase glutathione S-transferase activity (1.8-fold) and glutathione content (1.4-fold) of the cells. Alkaline phosphatase activity as a marker of differentiation was also significantly enhanced (1.7-fold). The fermented bread samples significantly inhibited LT97 cell growth and increased the level of apoptotic cells (1.8-fold). Only marginal effects on apoptosis in tumour compared to normal tissue were observed.
   This is the first study which presents chemopreventive effects of different breads after in vitro fermentation. In spite of differences in composition, the results were comparable between the bread types. Nevertheless, they indicate a potential involvement of this staple food product regarding the prevention of colon cancer.

   Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. The best strategy to control stripe rust is to grow resistant cultivars, but only a few effective genes are available. The wheat accession H9020-1-6-8-3 is a translocation line previously developed from interspecific hybridization between wheat genotype 7182 and Psathyrostachys huashanica, and is resistant to most Chinese Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici races. To identify the resistance genes in the translocation line, H9020-1-6-8-3 was crossed with susceptible genotype Mingxian 169, and seedlings of parents and F-1, F-2, and F-3 progenies were tested with prevalent Chinese P striiformis f. sp. tritici races CYR32 and CYR33 under controlled greenhouse conditions. The genetic results indicated that two single dominant genes in H9020-1-6-8-3 confer resistance to CYR32 and CYR33, respectively. The gene for resistance to CYR33 was temporarily designated as YrH9020. Six simple-sequence repeat markers were used to map the resistance gene to the short arm of wheat chromosome 2D, using 329 F2 plants tested with CYR33 in the greenhouse. The genetic distances of the two closest flanking markers, Xgwm261 and Xgwm455, were 4.4 and 5.8 centimorgans, respectively. Disease assessments and polymorphic tests of the flanking markers among the Psathyrostachys huashanica line and wheat lines 7182, H9020-1-6-8-3, and Mingxian169 suggested that the resistance gene YrH9020 in H9020-1-6-8-3 was originally from P huashanica. The exotic stripe rust resistance gene and linked molecular markers should be useful for pyramiding with other genes to develop wheat cultivars with high-level and durable resistance to stripe rust.

AB Fructans are soluble carbohydrates with health benefits and possible roles in plant adaptation. Fructan biosynthetic genes were isolated using comparative genomics and physical mapping followed by BAC sequencing in barley. Genes encoding sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST), fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (1-FFT) and sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) were clustered together with multiple copies of vacuolar invertase genes and a transposable element on two barley BAC. Intron-exon structures of the genes were similar. Phylogenetic analysis of the fructosyltransferases and invertases in the Poaceae showed that the fructan biosynthetic genes may have evolved from vacuolar invertases. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using leaf RNA extracted from three wheat cultivars grown under different conditions. The 1-SST, 1-FFT and 6-SFT genes had correlated expression patterns in our wheat experiment and in existing barley transcriptome database. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed and successfully mapped to a major QTL region affecting wheat grain fructan accumulation in two independent wheat populations. The alleles controlling high- and low- fructan in parental lines were also found to be associated in fructan production in a diverse set of 128 wheat lines. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the mapping and sequencing of a fructan biosynthetic gene cluster and in particular, the isolation of a novel 1-FFT gene from barley.

TI QTL mapping of adult-plant resistance to stripe rust in a population

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikss., is a severe foliar disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Use of adult-plant resistance (APR) is an efficient approach to provide long-term protection of crops from the disease. The German spring wheat cultivar Naxos showed a high level of APR to stripe rust in the field. To identify the APR genes in this cultivar, a mapping population of 166 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between Naxos and Shanghai 3/Catbird (SHA3/CBRD), a moderately susceptible line developed by CIMMYT. The RILs were evaluated for maximum disease severity (MDS) in Sichuan and Gansu in the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 cropping seasons. Composite interval mapping (CIM) identified four QTL, QYr.caas-1BL.1RS, QYr.caas-1DS, QYr.caas-5BL.3 and QYr.caas-7BL.1, conferring stable resistance to stripe rust across all environments, each explaining 1.9-27.6, 2.1-5.8, 2.5-7.8 and 3.7-9.1 % of the phenotypic variance, respectively. QYr.caas-1DS flanked by molecular markers XUgwm353-Xgdm33b was likely a new QTL for APR to stripe rust. Because the interval between flanking markers for each QTL was less than 6.5 cM, these QTL and their closely linked markers are potentially useful for improving resistance to stripe rust in wheat breeding.

AB Stripe rust and leaf rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikss. and P. triticina, respectively, are devastating fungal diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Chinese wheat cultivar Bainong 64 has maintained acceptable adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust, leaf rust and powdery mildew for more than 10 years. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci/locus (QTL) for resistance to the two rusts in a population of 179 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from Bainong 64 x Jingshuang 16. The DH lines were planted in randomized complete blocks with three replicates at four locations. Stripe rust tests were conducted using a mixture of currently prevalent P. striiformis races, and leaf rust tests were performed with P. triticina race THTT. Leaf rust severities were scored two or three times, whereas maximum disease severities (MDS) were recorded for stripe rust. Using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, five independent loci for APR to two rusts were detected. The QTL on chromosomes 1BL and 6BS contributed by Bainong 64 conferred resistance to both diseases. The loci identified on chromosomes 7AS and 4DL had minor effects on stripe rust response, whereas another locus, close to the centromere on chromosome 6BS, had a significant effect only on leaf rust response. The loci located on chromosomes 1BL and 4DL also had significant effects on powdery mildew response. These were located at the same positions as the Yr29/Lr46 and Yr46/Lr67 genes, respectively. The multiple disease resistance locus for APR on chromosome 6BS appears to be new. All three genes and their closely linked molecular markers could be used in breeding wheat cultivars with durable resistance to multiple diseases.

AB Soil salinity is a major environmental stress limiting plant productivity. Vacuole Na+/H+ antiporters play important roles for the survival of plants under salt stress conditions. We have developed salt stress tolerant transgenic tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. PED) by overexpression of the wheat Na+/H+ antiporter gene TaNHX2 using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harbouring a binary vector pBin438 that contains the TaNHX2 gene under the control of double CaMV 35S promoter and npt II as a selectable marker. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed that TaNHX2 gene has been integrated and expressed in the T-1 generation transgenic tomato plants. When TaNHX2 expressing plants were exposed to 100 or 150 mM NaCl, they were found to be more tolerant to salt stress compared to wild type plants. Biochemical analyses also showed that transgenic plants have substantial amount of relative water content and chlorophyll content under salt stress conditions compared to wild type plants. The relative water content in transgenic and wild type plants ranged from 68 to 75 % and 46-73 % and chlorophyll content fall in between 1.8 to 2.4 mg/g fw and 1.0 to 2.4 mg/g fw, respectively, in all stress conditions. In the present study, we observed a better germination rate of T-1 transgenic seeds under salt stress conditions compared with wild type plants. Our results indicated that TaNHX2-transgenic tomato plants coped better with salt stress than wild type plants.

AB In Europe and North America, deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most prevalent mycotoxin associated with wheat head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum. Because DON is toxic to plants and enhances the ability of the pathogen to spread within a spike, wheat lines with resistance to DON should be more resistant to head blight. Resistance to DON has been associated with resistance gene Fhb1 that confers resistance to spread within a spike. The objectives of this study were to determine if wheat lines resistant to head blight were also resistant to DON, if genes other than Fhb1 confer resistance to DON, and to identify lines able to fill grain in the presence of DON. Susceptible controls and diverse North American and European winter wheat lines with resistance to head blight were screened for molecular markers linked to known head blight resistance genes, and evaluated in a greenhouse for resistance to DON and relative yield after application of DON to spikes at flowering. Fhb1 appeared to have the unique ability to confer resistance to DON, as measured by the number of DON-bleached primary florets. However, this resistance did not protect plants from the phytotoxic effects of DON on kernel formation as measured by the relative yield of treated spikes. Furthermore, measuring the relative yield loss following DON application may be useful for identifying lines with tolerance to head blight.

AB Background: While the genetic transformation of the major cereal crops has become relatively routine, to date only a few reports were published on transgenic triticale, and robust data on T-DNA integration and segregation have not been available in this species.
   Results: Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of stable transgenic winter triticale cv. Bogo carrying the selectable marker gene HYGROMYCIN PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE (HPT) and a synthetic green fluorescent protein gene (gfp). Progeny of four independent transgenic plants were comprehensively investigated with regard to the number of integrated T-DNA copies, the number of plant genomic integration loci, the integrity and functionality of individual T-DNA copies, as well as the segregation of transgenes in T-1 and T-2 generations, which also enabled us to identify homozygous transgenic lines. The truncation of some integrated T-DNAs at their left end along with the occurrence of independent segregation of multiple T-DNAs unintendedly resulted in a single-copy segregant that is selectable marker-free and homozygous for the gfp gene. The heritable expression of gfp driven by the maize UBI-1 promoter was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy.
   Conclusions: The used transformation method is a valuable tool for the genetic engineering of triticale. Here we show that comprehensive molecular analyses are required for the correct interpretation of phenotypic data collected from the transgenic plants.

AB Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammatory condition that develops in genetically susceptible individuals after exposure to dietary wheat gliadin. The role of post-translational modifications of gliadin catalyzed by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) seems to play a crucial role in CD. However, it remains to be established how and where tTG is activated in vivo. We have investigated whether gliadin peptides modulate intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and tTG activity.
   Methods/Principal Findings: We studied Ca2+ homeostasis in Caco-2 cells by single cell microfluorimetry. Under our conditions, A-gliadin peptides 31-43 and 57-68 rapidly mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Specifically, peptide 31-43 mobilized Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, whereas peptide 57-68 mobilized Ca2+ only from mitochondria. We also found that gliadin peptide-induced Ca2+ mobilization activates the enzymatic function of intracellular tTG as revealed by in situ tTG activity using the tTG substrate pentylamine-biotin. Moreover, we demonstrate that peptide 31-43, but not peptide 57-68, induces an increase of tTG expression. Finally, we monitored the expression of glucose-regulated protein-78 and of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-homologous protein, which are two biochemical markers of ER-stress, by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. We found that chronic administration of peptide 31-43, but not of peptide 57-68, induces the expression of both genes.
   Conclusions: By inducing Ca2+ mobilization from the ER, peptide 31-43 could promote an ER-stress pathway that may be relevant in CD pathogenesis. Furthermore, peptides 31-43 and 57-68, by activating intracellular tTG, could alter inflammatory key regulators, and induce deamidation of immunogenic peptides and gliadin-tTG crosslinking in enterocytes and specialized antigen-presenting cells.

AB Background: MADS-box genes constitute a large family of transcription factors functioning as key regulators of many processes during plant vegetative and reproductive development. Type II MADS-box genes have been intensively investigated and are mostly involved in vegetative and flowering development. A growing number of studies of Type I MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis, have assigned crucial roles for these genes in gamete and seed development and have demonstrated that a number of Type I MADS-box genes are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications. However, reports on agronomically important cereals such as barley and wheat are scarce.
   Results: Here we report the identification and characterization of two Type I-like MADS-box genes, from barley (Hordeum vulgare), a monocot cereal crop of high agronomic importance. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that the putative proteins are related to Type I MADS-box proteins, and classified them in a distinct cereal clade. Significant differences in gene expression among seed developmental stages and between barley cultivars with varying seed size were revealed for both genes. One of these genes was shown to be induced by the seed development- and stress-related hormones ABA and JA whereas in situ hybridizations localized the other gene to specific endosperm sub-compartments. The genomic organization of the latter has high conservation with the cereal Type I-like MADS-box homologues and the chromosomal position of both genes is close to markers associated with seed quality traits. DNA methylation differences are present in the upstream and downstream regulatory regions of the barley Type I-like MADS-box genes in two different developmental stages and in response to ABA treatment which may be associated with gene expression differences.
   Conclusions: Two barley MADS-box genes were studied that are related to Type I MADS-box genes. Differential expression in different seed developmental stages as well as in barley cultivars with different seed size was evidenced for both genes. The two barley Type I MADS-box genes were found to be induced by ABA and JA. DNA methylation differences in different seed developmental stages and after exogenous application of ABA is suggestive of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The study of barley Type I-like MADS-box genes extends our investigations of gene regulation during endosperm and seed development in a monocot crop like barley.

AB The Streptomyces phage phiC31 integrase was tested for its feasibility in excising transgenes from the barley genome through site-specific recombination. We produced transgenic barley plants expressing an active phiC31 integrase and crossed them with transgenic barley plants carrying a target locus for recombination. The target sequence involves a reporter gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is flanked by the attB and attP recognition sites for the phiC31 integrase. This sequence disruptively separates a gusA coding sequence from an upstream rice actin promoter. We succeeded in producing site-specific recombination events in the hybrid progeny of 11 independent barley plants carrying the above target sequence after crossing with plants carrying a phiC31 expression cassette. Some of the hybrids displayed fully executed recombination. Excision of the GFP gene fostered activation of the gusA gene, as visualized in tissue of hybrid plants by histochemical staining. The recombinant loci were detected in progeny of selfed F-1, even in individuals lacking the phiC31 transgene, which provides evidence of stability and generative transmission of the recombination events. In several plants that displayed incomplete recombination, extrachromosomal excision circles were identified. Besides the technical advance achieved in this study, the generated phiC31 integrase-expressing barley plants provide foundational stock material for use in future approaches to barley genetic improvement, such as the production of marker-free transgenic plants or switching transgene activity.

AB Background: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an allotetraploid species whose ancestral genomes are most likely derived from the A-genome species, A. duranensis, and the B-genome species, A. ipaensis. The very recent (several millennia) evolutionary origin of A. hypogaea has imposed a bottleneck for allelic and phenotypic diversity within the cultigen. However, wild diploid relatives are a rich source of alleles that could be used for crop improvement and their simpler genomes can be more easily analyzed while providing insight into the structure of the allotetraploid peanut genome. The objective of this research was to establish a high-density genetic map of the diploid species A. duranensis based on de novo generated EST databases. Arachis duranensis was chosen for mapping because it is the A-genome progenitor of cultivated peanut and also in order to circumvent the confounding effects of gene duplication associated with allopolyploidy in A. hypogaea.
   Results: More than one million expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences generated from normalized cDNA libraries of A. duranensis were assembled into 81,116 unique transcripts. Mining this dataset, 1236 EST-SNP markers were developed between two A. duranensis accessions, PI 475887 and Grif 15036. An additional 300 SNP markers also were developed from genomic sequences representing conserved legume orthologs. Of the 1536 SNP markers, 1054 were placed on a genetic map. In addition, 598 EST-SSR markers identified in A. hypogaea assemblies were included in the map along with 37 disease resistance gene candidate (RGC) and 35 other previously published markers. In total, 1724 markers spanning 1081.3 cM over 10 linkage groups were mapped. Gene sequences that provided mapped markers were annotated using similarity searches in three different databases, and gene ontology descriptions were determined using the Medicago Gene Atlas and TAIR databases. Synteny analysis between A. duranensis, Medicago and Glycine revealed significant stretches of conserved gene clusters spread across the peanut genome. A higher level of colinearity was detected between A. duranensis and Glycine than with Medicago.
   Conclusions: The first high-density, gene-based linkage map for A. duranensis was generated that can serve as a reference map for both wild and cultivated Arachis species. The markers developed here are valuable resources for the peanut, and more broadly, to the legume research community. The A-genome map will have utility for fine mapping in other peanut species and has already had application for mapping a nematode resistance gene that was introgressed into A. hypogaea from A. cardenasii.

DT Article

ID CROP IMPROVEMENT; WHEAT
AB Background: Food security is an issue that has come under renewed scrutiny amidst concerns that substantial yield increases in cereal crops are required to feed the world's booming population. Wheat is of fundamental importance in this regard being one of the three most important crops for both human consumption and livestock feed; however, increase in crop yields have not kept pace with the demands of a growing world population. In order to address this issue, plant breeders require new molecular tools to help them identify genes for important agronomic traits that can be introduced into elite varieties. Studies of the genome using next-generation sequencing enable the identification of molecular markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms that may be used by breeders to identify and follow genes when breeding new varieties. The development and application of next-generation sequencing technologies has made the characterisation of SNP markers in wheat relatively cheap and straightforward. There is a growing need for the widespread dissemination of this information to plant breeders.
   Description: CerealsDB is an online resource containing a range of genomic datasets for wheat (Triticum aestivum) that will assist plant breeders and scientists to select the most appropriate markers for marker assisted selection. CerealsDB includes a database which currently contains in excess of 100,000 putative varietal SNPs, of which several thousand have been experimentally validated. In addition, CerealsDB contains databases for DArT markers and EST sequences, and links to a draft genome sequence for the wheat variety Chinese Spring.
   Conclusion: CerealsDB is an open access website that is rapidly becoming an invaluable resource within the wheat research and plant breeding communities.

AB Genotypic variation for response to boron (B) deficiency in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was determined as grain set index (GSI %) and found to be controlled by two major genes. Bo(d)1 and Bo(d)2. Breeding for B efficiency may be enhanced by molecular markers associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for B efficiency. Two mapping populations, (Bonza x SW 41) BC2 and Fang 60 x Bonza, were made from Bonza (B inefficient), SW 41 (B moderately inefficient), and Fang 60 (B efficient) parents. Leaf samples from F-2 plants from each cross were used for DNA analysis. GSI was measured in F-2-derived F-3 families. Seven hundred and eighty-seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used. Bulked segregant analysis and QTL analysis were performed to identify the chromosomal location for B efficiency. One QTL for B efficiency was identified and mapped in (Bonza x SW 41) BC2F3, and was found to be flanked by two SSR markers, gwm192, and gwm165. This QTL is located on the long arm of chromosome 4D between gwm165 and gwm192. This QTL region corresponded for 21% of the variation in GSI, suggesting that the chromosome segment of SW 41 parent containing the Bo(d)2 locus was inherited by the progenies and that is located on 4D. Additional markers and further examination are required to locate Bo(d)1, the other B efficient gene. Linked markers will enable applications of marker-assisted selection for B-efficient genotypes in wheat.

AB The wheat-alien small segment translocation (SAST) lines carrying the beneficial genes from wild species are useful genetic stocks for wheat improvement. In this study, to introduce the grain hardness-related genes of Haynaldia villosa (L.) Schur. into common wheat (Triticum aesitivum L.), the mature female gametes of whole-arm wheat - H. villosa translocation line T5VS.5DL was irradiated by (CO)-C-60-gamma ray to develop SAST lines involving 5VS. Among the BC2F2 population, six homozygous SAST lines with different fragment sizes of 5VS were identified by GISH, and the exact fragment sizes were further defined using four 5VS-specific markers and four Ha gene-based markers. The results showed that five lines (NAU5VS-1 to NAU5VS-5) carried the softness gene Dina/Dinb of H. villosa, and that NAU5VS-5 had the smallest alien translocation segment, identified to be a 5VS-6AS.6AL terminal translocation. The translocation chromosome 5VS-6AS.6AL was proved to be stably inherited to the successive generations. In the BC3F2 generation, the individuals having the homozygous 5VS-6AS.6AL translocation chromosomes all showed soft grain texture, with an approximately 50% reduction in the SKCS hardness index compared with that of their backcrossing parent. Both the 5VS-6AS.6AL translocation line and the molecular markers developed in this study will be valuable in wheat breeding for soft grain quality improvement.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat and barley worldwide. The disease is primarily caused by members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex, consisting of at least 14 phylogenetically distinct species. To determine the population structure of the FHB pathogens in a naturally infected disease nursery located at Jianyang, Fujian province, China, 160 isolates of the E graminearum complex were recovered from symptomatic wheat spike samples collected in two consecutive years (2008 and 2009) and characterized using species- and chemotype-specific polymerase chain reaction as well as variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. All isolates analyzed were identified as F. asiaticum except for one isolate, which was identified as F. avenaceum. Among the 159 E asiaticum isolates, 126 (79%) isolates were of the nivalenol (NIV) type while 29 (18%) isolates were of the 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol type and only 4 (3%) isolates were of the 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol type. The 10 VNTR markers revealed 124 distinct haplotypes and 76 polymorphic alleles across the whole population. The two subpopulations (FA-08 and FA-09) grouped based on the year of collection exhibited low genetic differentiation (F-st = 0.032) and high gene flow (N-m = 15.13). However, a significant genetic differentiation was found within the NIV-type isolates as revealed by the Structure software. The pairwise linkage disequilibrium tests did not support the hypothesis of random mating in the population because half (48.8%) of the locus pairs showed a linkage disequilibrium (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that FHB in this nursery was caused by a genetically homogenous and non-random mating population of F. asiaticum in 2008 and 2009, which consisted of all three trichothecene types with various levels of aggressiveness.

AB The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line CI13227 with slow rusting resistance to leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., was crossed and backcrossed to 'Thatcher' (Tc) wheat. Backcross F-2 families were tested for seedling resistance and segregated in a 1:1 ratio for families that segregated for resistance and families that were homozygous susceptible. The BC1F2 resistant seedlings were progeny tested for infection type (IT) as BC1F3 lines and compared for IT with near-isogenic lines of Tc with alleles at the Lr3 locus. The BC1F3 lines and the Tc line with Lr3ka had nearly identical IT. The F-2 progeny of a resistant BC1F3 plant and a Tc line with Lr3ka did not segregate for IT confirming that CI13227 had an allele at the Lr3 locus. The BC1F2 plants from families that were homozygous susceptible as seedlings were tested as adults for leaf rust IT. Resistant BC1F2 adult plants were selected and advanced to BC1F6 by single seed descent. A single BC1F6 plant was crossed with Tc, and the Tc*3/CI13227 population advanced to F-6. The F-6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were tested for leaf rust resistance at two locations. Molecular mapping with Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers detected a major locus for resistance on chromosome 1BL. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) marker specifi c for Lr46 also mapped in the 1BL region associated with resistance. Quantitative trait loci on 2DS, 2B, and 7BL for slow rusting resistance in CI13227 detected in previous experiments were not detected in this study. CI13227 has seedling resistance gene Lr3ka and likely has the adult plant resistance gene Lr46.

AB In this study we assess the genetic architecture of bread-making quality traits in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A mapping population derived from BR34 and 'Grandin' was used to measure 20 end-use quality traits including six kernel, seven milling and flour, four dough mixing strength, and three bread-making traits. A total of 31 quantitative trait loci (QTL) significantly associated with all but two traits were identified. These QTL were clustered in five chromosomal regions, namely 1BS, 1DL, 4BL, 5BL, and 6AS, and explained a large proportion of trait variation with favorable alleles contributed by both parents. The 1DL cluster containing the high molecular weight glutenin gene, Glu-D1, had a large genetic influence on dough mixing strength and bread-making performance. Most of the QTL affecting kernel traits were clustered on 6AS. Inconsistency of QTL locations detected from different environments was observed for the flour and milling traits and was likely due to genotype x environment interaction (G x E) effects. Despite high heritabilities estimated for the 20 quality traits evaluated, no QTL were found for flour brightness and bake water absorption, suggesting that these traits may be controlled by QTL with small effects that could not be detected due to the small population size. Because of the complex inheritance of these traits, it will be necessary to validate these QTL in different spring wheat backgrounds evaluated in similar growth conditions as used in this study before the marker information can be used for breeding applications.

AB In order to locate the QTLs for plant height, peduncle length, and heading date, a set of 107 wheat doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross Fukuho-komugix Oligoculm was grown during the growing seasons of 2004 and 2005. A total of 36 QTLs were identified based on composite interval mapping (CIM) approach. All detected plant height QTL's were stable over the two years. QTLs located near RhtD1 (chromosome 4D) and in the Xta556-RhtB1 interval (chromosome 4B) accounted for, respectively, 40.1% and 28.9% of plant height variation in 2004 and 30.7% and 26.36% in 2005. The other two QTLs identified for plant height were located near Xcfd53 and Xwmc25a loci on chromosome 2D. The results of composite interval mapping indicated that all detected QTLs for peduncle length were coincident with plant height QTLs. Of the most important heading date QTLs, the only stable one over years was located in the Xcfd53-Xbarc168 interval on chromosome 2D and accounted for 34.05% and 31.9% of heading date variation in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Xbarc168-Xgwm484 interval (LOD> 8.3) carried the other important QTL for heading date in 2004. In general, based on expression of stable and major effect QTLs in present study, it is possible to increase efficiency of marker assisted selection for the traits in breeding programs.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Resistance is the best approach to control the disease. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) stripe rust resistance has proven to be race non-specific and durable. However, genes conferring high-levels of HTAP resistance are limited in number and new genes are urgently needed for breeding programs to develop cultivars with durable high-level resistance to stripe rust. Spring wheat germplasm PI 183527 showed a high-level of HTAP resistance against stripe rust in our germplasm evaluations over several years. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, we crossed PI 183527 and susceptible wheat line Avocet S. Adult plants of parents, F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 progeny were tested with selected races under the controlled greenhouse conditions and in fields under natural infection. PI 183527 has a single dominant gene conferring HTAP resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in combination with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) were used to identify markers linked to the resistance gene. A linkage map consisting of 4 RGAP and 7 SSR markers was constructed for the resistance gene using data from 175 F-2 plants and their derived F-2:3 lines. Amplification of nulli-tetrasomic, ditelosomic and deletion lines of Chinese Spring with three RGAP markers mapped the gene to the distal region (0.86-1.0) of chromosome 7BL. The molecular map spanned a genetic distance of 27.3 cM, and the resistance gene was narrowed to a 2.3-cM interval flanked by markers Xbarc182 and Xwgp5258. The polymorphism rates of the flanking markers in 74 wheat lines were 74 and 30 %, respectively; and the two markers in combination could distinguish the alleles at the resistance locus in 82 % of tested genotypes. To determine the genetic relationship between this resistance gene and Yr39, a gene also on 7BL conferring HTAP resistance in Alpowa, a cross was made between PI 183527 and Alpowa. F-2 segregation indicated that the genes were 36.5 +/- A 6.75 cM apart. The gene in PI 183527 was therefore designed as Yr52. This new gene and flanking markers should be useful in developing wheat cultivars with high-level and possible durable resistance to stripe rust.

AB Wheat stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici can cause devastating yield losses in wheat. Over the past several decades, stem rust has been controlled worldwide through the use of genetic resistance. Stem rust race TTKSK (Ug99), first detected in Uganda in 1998, threatens global wheat production because of its unique virulence combination. As the majority of the currently grown cultivars and advanced breeding lines are susceptible to race TTKSK, sources of resistance need to be identified and characterized to facilitate their use in agriculture. South Dakota breeding line SD 1691 displayed resistance to race TTKSK in the international wheat stem rust nursery in Njoro, Kenya. Seedling screening of progeny derived from SD 1691 crossed to susceptible LMPG-6 indicated that a single resistance gene was present. Allelism and race-specificity tests indicated the stem rust resistance gene in SD 1691 was Sr28. The chromosome arm location of Sr28 was previously demonstrated to be 2BL. We identified molecular markers linked to Sr28 and validated this linkage in two additional populations. Common spring wheat cultivars in the central United States displayed allelic diversity for markers flanking Sr28. These markers could be used to select for Sr28 in breeding populations and for combining Sr28 with other stem rust resistance genes.

AB Quantitative resistance is postulated to be more durable than qualitative (R-gene mediated) resistance, which is usually quickly overcome by the pathogen population. Despite its wide use for nearly 10 years in France, the French bread wheat cultivar Apache remains resistant to stripe rust. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of cv. Apache resistance to examine whether its durability could be explained by quantitative characteristics. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) by composite interval mapping of disease progress data recorded throughout 4 years of field assays. These assays included inoculation with three different pathotypes on a segregating population originating from a cross between cv. Apache and cv. Taldor, a French cultivar susceptible to stripe rust. Three QTLs derived from Apache, QYr.inra-2AS, QYr.inra-2BL and QYr.inra-4B, were detected. Each of these QTLs contributed between approximately 15 and 69 % of the phenotypic variance and corresponds to a race-specific resistance gene. We showed that QYr.inra-2AS and QYr.inra-2BS map to the positions of Yr17 and Yr7, respectively, whereas QYr.inra-4B corresponds to an adult plant resistance gene. Our results demonstrate that a combination of two or more race-specific resistance genes can confer durable resistance provided that it is properly managed at a continental level. Race-specific resistance genes should not be removed from breeding programs provided that they are properly managed.

AB Powdery mildew (PM), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), has become a serious disease and caused severe yield losses in the wheat production worldwide. Resistance gene(s) in wheat cultivars can be quickly overcome by newly evolved pathogen races when these genes are employed for long time or in a large area. It is urgent to search for new sources of resistance to be used in wheat breeding. Tabasco is a German resistant cultivar and a new source of resistance gene(s) to PM. An F-2 population was developed from a cross between Tabasco and a Chinese susceptible cultivar Ningnuo 1. Infection types in 472 F-2 plants and 436 F2-3 families were evaluated by inoculating plants with isolate Bgt19. Results showed that a single dominant gene, designed Pm46, controlled powdery mildew resistance in Tabasco. This gene was located to the short arm of chromosome 5D (5DS) and flanked by simple sequence repeat markers Xgwm205 and Xcfd81 at 18.9 cM apart. Because another resistance gene Pm2 was also located on 5DS, 15 Bgt isolates were used to inoculate Tabasco and Ulka/8*Cc (Pm2 carrier). The results showed that Tabasco was highly resistant to all of the 15 isolates tested, while Ulka/8*Cc was susceptible to 4 of the isolates, suggesting that Tabasco may carry resistant gene(s) different from Pm2 gene in Ulka/8*Cc. To test the allelism between Pm46 and Pm2, an F-2 population between Tabasco and Ulka/8*Cc was developed. Isolate Bgt2, avirulent to both parents, was used to evaluate the F-2 population and two susceptible plants were identified from 536 progenies with F-2 plants. This result indicated that Pm46 is not allelic to Pm2. Therefore, Pm46 is a new gene for PM resistance identified in this study.

AB We report the isolation of Pi1, a gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that Pi1 is an allele at the Pik locus. Like other alleles at this locus, Pi1 consists of two genes. A functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) was identified that allows differentiation of Pi1 from other Pik alleles and other non-Pik genes. A extensive germplasm survey using this FNP reveals that Pi1 is a rare allele in germplasm collections and one that has conferred durable resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogen isolates.

AB TaGW2, an orthologous gene of rice OsGW2, has been associated with kernel width and weight of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Difference in TaGW2 coding sequence was not found among different wheat varieties in previous researches. In this study, we found eight exons and seven introns in TaGW2 with a full-length cDNA sequence of 1,275 bp, which contains a conserved function domain and seven splice sites that shared homology with rice OsGW2. A single T-base insertion in the eighth exon of TaGW2 on chromosome 6A was detected in a large-kernel wheat variety, Lankaodali. This insertion mutation reduces the coding protein sequence from normal 424 amino acids (similar to 47.2 kDa) to 328 amino acids (similar to 37.1 kDa) by truncating 96 amino acids. The result was validated by identifying histidine-tagged TaGW2 proteins encoded by both alleles of the mutant and the wild types in SDS-PAGE. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed based on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. The SNP markers were genotyped for an F-2 segregation population from the cross of Lankaodali x Chinese Spring. Seed traits of F-2:3 families were evaluated in three different environments. The association analysis indicated that F-2:3 families with the mutated TaGW2 allele significantly increased kernel width (KW) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and slightly improved kernel length (KL). Using the SNP markers, another two varieties harbored the mutated TaGW2 allele were successfully identified from 22 additional wheat varieties, and they both have large KW and TKW. Cloning and sequencing of the gene further confirmed the functions of the mutated allele of TaGW2 in the two large kernel varieties. The results suggested that TaGW2 may negatively regulate kernel size variation, which shares the same function as OsGW2 in rice. The successful development of SNP markers provides a useful tool for improving kernel yield in wheat.

AB 'Becker'/'Massey' (Reg. No. MP-5, NSL 479730 MAP), is a soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. This mapping population is composed of 152 F-7:14 RILs that were developed using single-seed descent in earlier generations (F-2:3 - F-7:8) and then advanced and tested in headrows in the field in later generations. The population has been used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with adult plant resistance to powdery mildew [APR-PM; caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f.sp. tritici Em. Marchal (syn. Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici)] and Fusarium head blight (FHB), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telomorph: Gibberella zeae Schw. (Petch)]. It also has been used to study the effects of dwarfing and photoperiod-sensitivity genes on expression of FHB resistance. Genetic marker data collected on this population includes 96 simple sequence repeat and 740 Diversity Arrays Technology (Yarralumla, ACT, Australia) markers. Chromosome linkage maps of this population were constructed, except for chromosomes 3D and 6D, and used for QTL analyses. Unique and major QTLs were identified for APR-PM on chromosomes 1BL, 2AL, and 2BL and for FHB resistance on 3BL, 4BS, and 4DS of Massey, which can be incorporated into cultivar development programs via enrichment of favorable alleles.

AB Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are very useful molecular markers for a number of plant species. We used a new publicly available module (TROLL) to extract microsatellites from the public database of soybean expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. A total of 12,833 sequences containing di- to penta-type SSRs were identified from 200,516 non-redundant soybean ESTs. On average, one SSR was found per 7.25 kb of EST sequences, with the tri-nucleotide motifs being the most abundant. Primer sequences flanking the SSR motifs were successfully designed for 9,638 soybean ESTs using the software primer3.0 and only 59 pairs of them were found in earlier studies. We synthesized 124 pairs of the primers to determine the polymorphism and heterozygosity among eight genotypes of soybean cultivars, which represented a wide range of the cultivated soybean cultivars. PCR amplification products with anticipated SSRs were obtained with 81 pairs of primers; 36 PCR products appeared to be homozygous and the remaining 45 PCR products appeared to be heterozygous and displayed polymorphism among the eight cultivars. We further analysed the EST sequences containing 45 polymorphic EST-SSR markers using the programs BLASTN and BLASTX. Sequence alignment showed that 29 ESTs have homologous sequences and 15 ESTs could be classified into a Uni-gene cluster with comparatively convincing protein products. Among these 15 ESTs belonging to a Uni-gene cluster, 9 SSRs were located in 3'-UTR, 4 SSRs were located in the intron region and 2 SSRs were located in the CDS region. None of these SSRs was located in the 5'-UTR. These novel SSRs identified in the ESTs of soybean provide useful information for gene mapping and cloning in future studies.

AB Using molecular genetics method, two selected dryland farming winter wheat strains (accession No. 22 Xiaoyan and 92517-25-1) were hybridized to produce 227 recombinant inbred lines (RIL). The populations of F-2:3 families, individual plant inbred produced from F2 population, were characterized by transgressive inheritance. Allelopathic potential of No. 22 Xiaoyan was stronger than 92517-25-1, as was its weed competitive ability. Both indicators were normally distributed among the RILs, which ranged between those of the two parents. We found that the allelopathic potential of wheat in the Loess Plateau of China was regulated by multiple genes with descending importance in a quantitative model. Allelopathy was adjusted by heritable genes for the heritability (H-G(2))= 0.895 and the interaction heritability of between the genotypes and the growth environment (H-GE(2))= 0.58. Four QTLs were identified in 21 wheat chromosomes with a mean length of 14.7 cM, i.e., 75% of the allelopathy genes were in chromosome 1A while 2B contained the remaining 25%. All of these functional genes were highly polymorphic. The additive effects and explained variance of the individual QTLs were 0.08-0.21 and 7.24-12.56%, respectively. Putative genes related to the weed competitive ability of wheat were detected on chromosomes 1A, 2B, and 5D. The wheat allelopathy QTLs identified in this study may be beneficial for the breeding of allelopathic wheat and the molecular manipulation of allelopathic genes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, a set of 63 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of bread wheat, was evaluated for marker-trait association using SSR markers and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Five accessions of Ae. tauschii (TA1644, TA1642, TA1695, TA2452 and TA2473) were resistant to Hessian fly whereas seven (TA1649, TA2460, TA2450, TA2541, TA2470, TA2397 and TA749) were resistant to leaf rust pathogen. However one accession TA1695 was also resistant to pest green bug. Significant associations across D-genome revealed that chromosome 2D is associated with resistance to several stress factors. Two alleles at Xgwm296 locus were associated with resistance to leaf rust, Septoria leaf blotch, green bug, and salt tolerance. Another locus Xgwm261 detected association for resistance to leaf rust, Septoria leaf blotch and Hessian fly. The existence of a QTL for tolerance to high salt concentration was also detected through association with marker Xcfd11, located on this chromosome. Furthermore association analysis also detected two SSR markers, Xgwm261 and Xgdm35, each with a fragment amplified in the leaf rust resistant accessions while lacking in the susceptible accessions. This study reveals the potential of association analysis in identifying the genomic regions having strong influence on useful traits. Through association mapping the germplasm collections can be initially screened and characterized to identify candidate genetic stocks and genomic regions. Subsequently, bi-parental crosses can be initiated for fine genetic mapping of genes or QTLs through linkage analysis.

AB Thirteen common wheat "Chinese Spring" (CS)-Thinopyrum junceum addition lines and three common wheat "Fukuhokomuji"(Fuku)-Elymus rectisetus addition lines were characterized and verified as disomic additions of a Th. junceum or E. rectisetus chromosome in the wheat backgrounds by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization. Another Fuku-E. rectisetus addition line, A1048, was found to contain multiple segregating E. rectisetus chromosomes. Seven partial CS-Th. junceum amphiploids were identified to combine 12-16 Th. junceum chromosomes with CS wheat chromosomes. The disomic addition lines AJDAj5, 7, 8, 9, and HD3508 were identified to contain a Th. junceum chromosome in homoeologous group 1. Two of them, AJDAj7 and AJDAj9, had the same Th. junceum chromosome. AJDAj2, 3, and 4 contained a Th. junceum chromosome in group 2, HD3505 in group 4, AJDAj6 and AJDAj11 in group 5, and AJDAj1 probably in group 6. The disomic addition lines A1026 and A1057 were identified to carry an E. rectisetus chromosome in group 1 and A1034 in group 5. E. rectisetus chromosomes in groups 1-6 were detected in A1048. The homoeologous group of the Th. junceum chromosome in HD3515 could not be determined in this study. Several Th. junceum and E. rectisetus chromosomes in the addition lines were found to contain genes for resistance to Fusarium head blight, tan spot, Stagonospora nodorum blotch, and stem rust (Ug99 races). Understanding of the homoeology of the Th. junceum and E. rectisetus chromosomes with wheat will facilitate utilization of the favorable genes on these alien chromosomes in wheat improvement.

AB Rusts are the most important biotic constraints limiting wheat productivity worldwide. Deployment of cultivars with broad spectrum rust resistance is the only environmentally viable option to combat these diseases. Identification and introgression of novel sources of resistance is a continuous process to combat the ever evolving pathogens. The germplasm of nonprogenitor Aegilops species with substantial amount of variability has been exploited to a limited extent. In the present investigation introgression, inheritance and molecular mapping of a leaf rust resistance gene of Ae. caudata (CC) acc. pau3556 in cultivated wheat were undertaken. An F-2 population derived from the cross of Triticum aestivum cv. WL711 - Ae. caudata introgression line T291-2 with wheat cultivar PBW343 segregated for a single dominant leaf rust resistance gene at the seedling and adult plant stages. Progeny testing in F-3 confirmed the introgression of a single gene for leaf rust resistance. Bulked segregant analysis using polymorphic D-genome-specific SSR markers and the cosegregation of the 5DS anchored markers (Xcfd18, Xcfd78, Xfd81 and Xcfd189) with the rust resistance in the F-2 population mapped the leaf rust resistance gene (LrAC) on the short arm of wheat chromosome 5D. Genetic complementation and the linked molecular markers revealed that LrAC is a novel homoeoallele of an orthologue Lr57 already introgressed from the 5M chromosome of Ae. geniculata on 5DS of wheat.

AB Bread-making quality in hexaploid wheats is a complex trait. It has been shown that the amount and composition of protein can influence dough rheological properties. The high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenins are encoded by a complex locus, Glu-1, on the long arm of group-1 homoeologus chromosome of the A, B and D genomes. In this work we used PCR-based DNA markers as a substitution tool to distinguish wheat bread-making quality. We detected PCR-based DNA markers for coding sequence of Glu-A1x, Glu-B1x and Glu-D1x to be 2300 bp, 2400 bp and 2500 bp respectively. DNA markers related to coding sequence of Glu-A1y, Glu-B1y and Glu-D1y were; 1800 bp, 2100 bp and 1950 bp, however, the repetitive region of their coding sequence were shown to be about 1300 bp, 1500 bp and 1600 bp. The results demonstrate that the size variation was due to different lengths of the central repetitive domain. Good or poor bread-making quality in wheat is associated with two allelic pairs of Glu-D1, designated 1Dx5-1Dy10 and IDx2-1Dy12. The 1Bx7 allele has moderate-to-good quality score. The specific DNA markers, of 450 bp, 576 bp, 612 bp and 2400 bp respectively were characterized for 1Dx5, 1Dy10, 1Dy12 and 1Bx7 alleles. These markers are very important in screening of wheat for bread-making quality.

AB Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a serious yield-limiting factor for wheat production worldwide. The objective of this study was to identify and map a stripe rust resistance gene in wheat line Shaannong 104 using SSR markers. F1, F2 and F3 populations from Shaannong 104/Mingxian 169 were inoculated with Chinese Pst race CYR32 in a greenhouse. Shaannong 104 carried a single dominant gene, YrSN104. Six potential polymorphic SSR markers identified in bulk segregant analysis were used to genotype F2 and F3 families. YrSN104 was closely linked with all six SSR markers on chromosome 1BS with genetic distances of 2.0 cM (Xgwm18, Xgwm273, Xbarc187), 2.6 cM (Xgwm11, Xbarc137) and 5.9 cM (Xbarc240). Pedigree analysis, pathogenicity tests using 26 Pst races, haplotyping of associated markers on isogenic lines carrying known stripe rust resistance genes, and associations with markers suggested that YrSN104 was a new resistance gene or an allele at the Yr24/Yr26 locus on chromosome 1BS. Deployment of YrSN104 singly or in combination to elite genotypes could play an effective role to lessen yield losses caused by stripe rust.

AB The Ppd-D1 controlling photoperiod response is an important gene for wheat adaptation since it affects heading time. In the present study, three haplotypes, i.e. haplotype I without deletion, haplotype II with a 24 bp deletion, and haplotype III with two deletions of 24 and 15 bp, were identified in the upstream of the coding region in 80 Ae. tauschii accessions. The haplotype distribution was related to subspecies taxon. All typical ssp. tauschii accessions had haplotype I, whereas all ssp. strangulata had haplotype III. The three haplotypes were observed in Ae. tauschii with morphologically intermediate forms between the two typical subspecies. Present results supported that ssp. strangulata or intermediate form was the D-genome donor of common wheat since only haplotype III were found in wheat. Moreover, a 16 bp deletion in exon 8 of gene Ppd-D1 exists in common wheat. However, none of Ae. tauschii accessions analyzed had the 16 bp deletion.

AB The evolution of a new race of stem rust, generally referred to as Ug99, threatens global wheat production because it can overcome widely deployed resistance genes that had been effective for many years. To identify loci conferring resistance to Ug99 in wheat, a genome-wide association study was conducted using 232 winter wheat breeding lines from the International Winter Wheat Improvement Program. Breeding lines were genotyped with diversity array technology, simple sequence repeat and sequence-tagged site markers, and phenotyped at the adult plant stage for resistance to stem rust in the stem rust resistance screening nursery at Njoro, Kenya during 2009-2011. A mixed linear model was used for detecting marker-trait associations. Twelve loci associated with Ug99 resistance were identified including markers linked to known genes Sr2 and Lr34. Other markers were located in the chromosome regions where no Sr genes have been previously reported, including one each on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 4A and 7B, two on chromosome 5B and four on chromosome 6B. The same data were used for investigating epistatic interactions between markers with or without main effects. The marker csSr2 linked to Sr2 interacted with wPt4930 on 6BS and wPt729773 in an unknown location. Another marker, csLV34 linked to Lr34, also interacted with wPt4930 on 6BS and wPt4916 on 2BS. The frequent involvement of wPt4916 on 2BS and wPt4930 on 6BS in interactions with other significant loci on the same or different chromosomes suggested complex genetic control for adult plant resistance to Ug99 in winter wheat germplasm.

AB Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating disease of wheat. The emergence of race TTKSK (Ug99) and new variants in Africa threatens wheat production worldwide. The best method of controlling stem rust is to deploy effective resistance genes in wheat cultivars. Few stem rust resistance (Sr) genes derived from the primary gene pool of wheat confer resistance to TTKSK. Norin 40, which carries Sr42, is resistant to TTKSK and variants TTKST and TTTSK. The goal of this study was to elucidate the inheritance of resistance to Ug99 in Norin 40 and map the Sr gene(s). A doubled haploid (DH) population of LMPG-6/Norin 40 was evaluated for resistance to the race TTKST. Segregation of 248 DH lines fitted a 1:1 ratio (chi (2) 1:1= 0.58, p = 0.45), indicating a single gene in Norin 40 conditioned resistance to Ug99. This was confirmed by an independent F-2:3 population also derived from the cross LMPG-6/Norin 40 where a 1:2:1 ratio (chi (2)1:2:1 = 0.69, p = 0.71) was observed following the inoculation with race TTKSK. Mapping with DNA markers located this gene to chromosome 6DS, the known location of Sr42. PCR marker FSD_RSA co-segregated with Sr42, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker BARC183 was closely linked (0.5 cM) to Sr42. A previous study found close linkage between FSD_RSA and SrCad, a temporarily designated gene that also confers resistance to Ug99, thus Sr42 may be the same gene or allelic. Marker FSD_RSA is suitable for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programs to improve stem rust resistance, including Ug99.

AB Development of high-yielding cereal crops could meet increasing global demands for food, feed and bio-fuels. Wheat is one of the world's most important cereal crops. The biosynthesis of starch is the major determinant of yield in wheat. Two starch biosynthesis genes, the waxy (Wx) genes and the starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) genes, were amplified and sequenced in 92 diverse wheat genotypes using genome-specific primers. Nucleotide diversity, haplotype analysis and association mapping were performed. The first exon (5'-UTR) and the first intron of the three homoeologous Wx genes were isolated using expressed sequence tag sequences. The Wx genes contained 12 exons separated by 11 introns. SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) frequency ranged from 1 SNP/3,648 bp for Wx-D1 to 1 SNP/135 bp for SSIIa-A1, with an average of 1 SNP/230 bp. The average SNP frequencies in exon and intron regions were 1 SNP/322 bp and 1 SNP/228 bp, respectively. Thirty, 23 and 5 SNPs were identified and formed five, six and five haplotypes for SSIIa-A1, SSIIa-B1 and SSIIa-D1, respectively. However, no association was found between these SNPs and seven yield-related traits. Twenty-two, 15 and 1 SNPs were detected and formed nine, five and two haplotypes for Wx-A1, Wx-B1 and Wx-D1, respectively. Three unique nucleotides C+A+T at SNP5, SNP6 and SNP12 formed Wx-B1-H3, which was significantly associated with increased grain weight, thousand kernel weight, and total starch content in three spring wheat genotypes and five winter wheat genotypes. Cost-effective and co-dominant SNP markers were developed using temperature-switch (TS)-PCR and are being used for marker-assisted selection of doubled haploid lines with enhanced grain yield and starch content in winter wheat breeding programs.

AB Genetic analysis across a whole plant genome based on pedigree information offers considerable potential for enhancing genetic gain from plant breeding programs through quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection. Here, we report its application for graphically genotyping varieties used in Chinese japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) pedigree breeding programs. We identified 34 important chromosomal regions from the founder parent that are under selection in the breeding programs, and by comparing donor genomic regions that are under selection with QTL locations of agronomic traits, we found that QTL clustered in important genomic regions, in accordance with association analyses of natural populations and other previous studies. The convergence of genomic regions under selection with QTL locations suggests that donor genomic regions harboring key genes/QTL for important agronomic traits have been selected by plant breeders since the 1950s from the founder rice plants. The results provide better understanding of the effects of selection in breeding programs on the traits of rice cultivars. They also provide potentially valuable information for enhancing rice breeding programs through screening candidate parents for targeted molecular markers, improving crop yield potential and identifying suitable genetic material for use in future breeding programs.

AB Sunflower rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia helianthi Schwein., was not a serious problem for many decades because of successful deployment of effective resistance genes in commercial sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) hybrids in North America. In the 1980s and early 1990s, however, a shift in virulence of the rust race population in North America rendered most of the commercial hybrids susceptible to new virulent races. A germplasm line, HA-R2, carrying the rust resistance gene R (5) was released as a multi-race rust-resistant line in 1985 but has not been widely used in commercial hybrid production. R (5) remains effective against the prevalent rust races of sunflower in North America. This gene was previously reported to be associated with two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, ORS316 and ORS630, which were mapped to linkage group (LG) 13 of sunflower. However, out of the 63 markers of LG13 screened in the present study, only 18, including ORS316 and ORS630, were polymorphic. These markers, which covered all of LG 13, were assayed in 94 individual F2 progenies derived from the cross of HA 89 with HA-R2. All failed to detect any locus in LG13 associated with the gene R (5) . Subsequently, a bulked segregant analysis was employed with an additional 510 SSR markers selected from the remaining 16 LGs of the sunflower genome. This analysis demonstrated that the LG2 markers showed association with rust resistance. Genotyping of the 94 F2 individuals with 23 polymorphic SSR markers from LG2 confirmed the R (5) location on LG2, flanked by two SSR markers, ORS1197-2 and ORS653a, at 3.3 and 1.8 cM of genetic distance, respectively. The markers for R (5) developed in this study will provide a useful tool for speeding up deployment of the R (5) gene in commercial sunflower hybrid production.

AB Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in public databases and cross-species transferable markers are considered to be a cost-effective means for developing sequence-based markers for less-studied species. In this study, EST-simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed from Lathyrus sativus L. EST sequences and cross-transferable EST-SSRs derived from Medicago truncatula L. were utilized to investigate the genetic diversity among grass pea populations from Ethiopia. A total of 45 alleles were detected using eleven EST-SSRs with an average of four alleles per locus. The average polymorphism information content for all primers was 0.416. The average gene diversity was 0.477, ranging from 0.205 for marker Ls942 to 0.804 for MtBA32F05. F (ST) values estimated by analysis of molecular variance were 0.01, 0.15, and 0.84 for among regions, among accessions and within accessions respectively, indicating that most of the variation (84%) resides within accessions. Model-based cluster analysis grouped the accessions into three clusters, grouping accessions irrespective of their collection regions. Among the regions, high levels of diversity were observed in Gojam, Gonder, Shewa and Welo regions, with Gonder region showing a higher number of different alleles. From breeding and conservation aspects, conducting a close study on a specific population would be advisable for genetic improvement in the crop, and it would be appropriate if future collection and conservation plans give due attention to under-represented regions.

AB Artificially induced translocation stocks have been used to physically map the barley genome; however, natural translocations are extremely uncommon in cultivated genotypes. Albacete is a barley variety widely grown in recent decades in Spain and carrying a reciprocal translocation which obviously does not affect its agronomical fitness. This translocation has been characterized by a combination of cytological and molecular genetic approaches. Firstly, recombination frequencies between markers on chromosomes 1H and 3H were estimated to determine the boundaries of the reciprocal interchange. Secondly, 1H-3H wheat barley telosome addition lines were used to assign selected markers to chromosome arms. Thirdly, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rDNA probes (5S and 18S-5.8S-26S) and microsatellite probes [(ACT)(5), (AAG)(5) and (CAG)(5)] was used to determine the locations of the translocation breakpoints more precisely. Fourthly, fine-mapping of the regions around the translocation breakpoints was used to increase the marker density for comparative genomics. The results obtained in this study indicate that the translocation is quite large with breakpoints located on the long arms of chromosomes 1H and 3H, between the pericentromeric (AAG)(5) bands and above the (ACT)(5) interstitial distal bands, resulting in the reciprocal translocation 1HS.1HL-3HL and 3HS.3HL-1HL. The gene content around the translocation breakpoints could be inferred from syntenic relationships observed among different species from the grass family Poaceae (rice, Sorghum and Brachypodium) and was estimated at approximately 1,100 and 710 gene models for 1H and 3H, respectively. Duplicated segments between chromosomes Os01 and Os05 in rice derived from ancestral duplications within the grass family overlap with the translocation breakpoints on chromosomes 1H and 3H in the barley variety Albacete.

AB Mechanisms regulating subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) insulin sensitivity and gene network expression during the peripartal period were evaluated in cows fed to meet or exceed prepartal energy requirements. Holstein cows were dried off at -50 d relative to expected parturition and fed a controlled-energy diet [CON; net energy for lactation = 1.24 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM); 36% of DM as wheat straw] until -21 d. Cows were then randomly assigned (n = 7/diet) to either the same CON diet or a moderate-energy close-up diet (OVE; net energy for lactation = 1.47 Mcal/kg of DM) until parturition. Biopsies of SAT were harvested at -10, 7, and 21 d for mRNA expression of 48 genes associated with insulin signaling, adipogenesis, and lipolysis. In vitro basal and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation (IRS1-PY) was assessed at -10 and 7 d. The OVE led to more positive energy balance and greater serum insulin concentration prepartum. Compared with CON, OVE led to a more drastic increase in serum NEFA and also greater overall serum BHBA postcalving, both of which were associated with greater hepatic total lipid and triacylglycerol concentration. Close-up OVE did not improve any aspect of performance. In prepartal SAT, insulin-stimulated IRS1-PY was greater in OVE than in CON. However, IRS1-PY, serum insulin, and GLUT4 expression decreased postpartum regardless of prepartal treatment, suggesting a more severe state of insulin resistance. The expression of all genes encoding adipogenic regulators (PPARG and ZFP423), most lipogenic enzymes/inducers (FASN, SCD, DGAT2, and INSIG1), and basal-lipolysis regulators (ATGL and ABDH5) was greater at 10 d in OVE than in CON. Whereas adipogenic and basal lipolysis regulator expression remained greater in cows fed OVE by 7 d postpartum, expression of all lipogenic enzymes decreased regardless of diet. Despite those responses, the approximately 3-fold increase in expression of IRS1 and ZFP423 between 7 and 21 d suggested that insulin responsiveness and adipogenic capacity of SAT were partially restored. Expression of the preadipocyte marker DLK1, adiponutrin (PNPLA3), and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) was undetectable. Results suggested that close-up energy overfeeding did not exacerbate insulin resistance in SAT. Signs of restored insulin responsiveness (upregulation of IRS1, INSIG2, SREBF1, and ZFP423) were apparent as early as 3 wk postpartum. Thus, identifying specific nutrients capable of activating PPAR gamma after calving in AT might help accelerate its replenishment. A regulatory network encompassing the genes and physiological measurements obtained is proposed.

AB The cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) gene plays a principal role in controlling cytokinin levels and has been shown to be a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting grain number in rice. However, the function and evaluation of the haplotypes of the wheat CKX gene have yet to be illustrated. In this study, TaCKX6-D1, a wheat ortholog of rice OsCKX2, was cloned and its haplotype variants were determined to be significantly associated with the 1000-grain weight on the basis of linkage mapping, association analysis and gene expression analysis. Five TaCKX6-D1 haplotypes, designated ae, were identified. An indel marker was developed to identify haplotype a, which was associated with higher grain weight. Haplotype a showed decreased expression relative to haplotype b in seeds at 8 d after pollination. Sequence variations among modern cultivars, landraces and wild species suggest a significant domestication signature at the TaCKX6-D1 locus in Chinese wheat germplasm. TaCKX6-D1 may serve as a useful gene for the breeding of high-yielding wheat. A strategy for allele mining and utilization of TaCKX6-D1 was proposed. Our study also sheds light on the mechanisms of grain development and domestication of wheat, as well as the functional divergence of orthologs in comparative genomics.
